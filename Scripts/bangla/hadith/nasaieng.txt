Then I was taken up to the Oft-Frequented House (Al-Bait al-Ma'mur) and I asked Jibra'il about it, and he said: 'This is Al-Bait al-Ma'mur in which seventy thousand angels pray everyday, and when they leave it they never come back.' Then I was taken up to Sidrah Al-Muntaha (the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary). Its fruits were like Qilal [2] of Hajar and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. At its base were four rivers: Two hidden rivers and two manifest rivers. I asked Jibril (About them) and he said: 'The two hidden ones are in paradise, and the two manifest ones are the Euphrates and the Nile.' Then fifty prayers were enjoined upon me. I came to Musa and he said: 'What happened?' I said: 'Fifty prayers have been enjoined upon me.' He said: 'I know more about the people than you. I tried hard with the Children of Israel. Your Ummah will never be able to bear that. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce it for you.' So I went back to my Lord and asked Him to reduce it, and He made it forty. Then I went back to Musa, peace be upon him, and he said: 'What happened?' I said: 'He made it forty.' He said to me something similar to what he said the first time, so I went back to my Lord and He made it thirty. I came to Musa, peace be upon him, and told him, and he said to me something similar to what he said the first time, so I went back to my Lord and he made it twenty, then ten, then five. I came to Musa, peace be upon him, and he said to me something like he had said the first time, but I said: 'I feel too shy before my Lord to go back to Him.' Then it was called out: 'I have decreed (the reward for) My obligation, and I have reduced the burden for My slaves and I will give a ten-fold reward for each good deed.' [1] It is like this here, while it is Jibra'il the first time it appears in this narration, and Jibra'il is often used in the Hadith literature. [2] Plural of Qullah

I said: 'He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.' Musa said to me: 'Go back to your Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, for your Ummah will not be able to do that.' So I went back to my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, and He reduced a portion of it. Then I came back to Musa and told him, and he said: 'Go back to you Lord, for your Ummah will not be able to do that.' So I went back to my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, and He said: 'They are five (prayers) but they are fifty (in reward), and the Word that comes from Me cannot be changed.' [1] I came back to Musa and he said: 'Go back to your Lord.' I said: 'I feel too shy before my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime.' [1]See Surah Qaf 50:29.

I mounted it, and Jibril was with me, and I set off. Then he said: 'Dismount and pray,' so I did that. He said: 'Do you know where you have prayed? You have prayed in Taibah, which will be the place of the emigration.' Then he said: 'Dismount and pray,' so I prayed. He said: 'Do you know where you have prayed? You have prayed in Mount Sinai, where Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, spoke to Musa, peace be upon him.' So I dismounted and prayed, and he said: 'Do you know where you have prayed? You have prayed in Bethlehem, where 'Eisa, peace be upon him, was born.' Then I entered Bait Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) where the Prophets, peace be upon them, were assembled for me, and Jibril brought me forward to lead them in prayer. Then I was taken up to the first heaven, where I saw Adam, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the second heaven where I saw the maternal cousins 'Eisa and Yahya, peace be upon them. Then I was taken up to the third heaven where I saw Yusuf, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the fourth heaven where I saw Harun, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the fifth heaven where I saw Idris, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the sixth heaven where I saw Musa, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven where I saw Ibrahim, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up above seven heavens and we came to Sidrah Al-Muntaha and I was covered with fog. I fell down prostrate and it was said to me: '(Indeed) The day I created the heavens and the Earth, I enjoined upon you and your Ummah fifty prayers, so establish them, you and your Ummah.' I came back to Ibrahim and he did not ask me about anything, then I came to Musa and he said: 'How much did your Lord enjoin upon you and your Ummah?' I said: 'Fifty prayers.' He said: 'You will not be able to establish them, neither you nor your Ummah. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce it.' So I went back to my Lord and He reduced it by ten. Then I came to Musa and he told me to go back, so I went back and He reduced it by ten. Then I came to Musa and he told me to go back, so I went back and He reduced it by ten. Then it was reduced it by ten. Then it was reduced to five prayers. He (Musa) said: 'Go back to you Lord and ask Him to reduce it, for two prayers were enjoined upon the Children of Israel but they did not establish them.' So I went back to my Lord and asked Him to reduce it, but He said: 'The day I created the heavens and the Earth, I enjoined fifty prayers upon you and your Ummah. Five is for fifty, so establish them, you and your Ummah.' I knew that this was what Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, had determined so I went back to Musa, peace be upon him, and he said: 'Go back.' But I knew that it was what Allah had determined, so I did not go back.

The Hadith. [1]  [1]With this chain, At-Tirmidhi recorded it (No. 302) and An-Nasai in Al-Kubra (No. 1631). It is the narration about the man who prayed incorrectly, and in it, the Prophet instructed him: Then Tashhad, then say the Iqamah. And they say that the meaning of Tashhad here is call the Adhan. An-Nasai recorded the Hadith with different chains (1054, 1137, 1314,1315). Whereas the wording narrated by At- Tirmidhi, and the author in Al-Kubra, mentions what the author mentioned in the chapter, the other cited versions that An-Nasai in this hook quoted do not. So it is as if he narrated the chain here for Hadith, indicating the same version that At-Tirmidhi narrated, and he himself in Al-Kubra, but he did not want to narrate the actual text here. Abu Dawud also narrated it with the order for the Adhan and Iqamah, through a different route of transmission (No. 861).

When we heard 'prayer is about to begin' we would perform Wudu' and go out to pray.'

The Virtue Of Giving The Call To Prayer                                      It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: When the call for the prayer is given, the Shaitan takes to his heels, passing wind loudly so that he will not hear the call to prayer.

And if they knew what (virtue) there is in 'Atamah and Subh prayer, they would come even if they had to crawl.

Then he said: 'This is what Mu'awiyah bin Abi Sufyan told me, narrating from statement of the Messenger of Allah.'

Whoever asks for Al-Wasilah for me, will be entitled to my intercession.'

Go away until Allah decides concerning you.' So I got up and went away. This is an abridged version of narration.   [1] It is this which the author cited the narration for.

If they knew what (virtue) there is in them, they would come, even if they had to crawl. And the virtue of the first row is like that of the row of the angels. If you knew its virtue, you would compete for it. A man's prayer with another man is greater in reward than his prayer alone. And a man's prayer with two other men is greater in reward than his prayer with one other man; the more people there are, the more beloved that is to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. '

There is no Muslim slave who performs Wudu and does it well, then walks to the prayer, but Allah will record one Hasanah (good deed) for each step he takes, or raise' him one level by it or erase one sin from him. I remember how we used to take short steps, and I remember (a time) when no one stayed behind from the prayer except a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known.
