He replied: Faith is that you believe in Allah, in His angels, in His book, in the meeting with Him, in His messengers and in the future resurrection. The man further asked: O Messenger of Allah! What is Islam? The Prophet said: Islam is that you worship Allah, do not associate with Him, perform the prescribed prayer, pay the prescribed Zakah (alms tax), and fast Ramadan. The man said: O Messenger of Allah, what is goodness (Ihsaan)? He replied: That you worship Allah as if you saw Him; for if you do not see Him, He still sees you. The man said: O Messenger of Allah, when will the Hour arrive? He said: The questioner is no more knowledgeable about this than the questioner himself. But as far as their omens are concerned, I will tell you the following: When the slave gives birth to her own master, that is one of the omens, when the naked and barefoot Becoming masters of the people is one of the omens, and when the uneducated camel drivers build high-rise buildings; This is also one of the omens. There are five things that only Allah knows. Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited:   Verily, with Allah alone is the knowledge of the hour. He sends down abundant rain. And he knows what is in the womb of his mother, while no one knows what he will acquire the next day, and no one knows in what country he will die.

This house is entered every day by seventy thousand angels who never visit it again. He (Gabriel) then led me to the lotus tree at the far end, whose leaves looked like the elephant's ears and whose fruits looked like the clay pots. But when it (the tree) was enveloped by the command of Allah, it was changed so that no one among the creatures of Allah can describe it for its beauty. Allah then revealed to me and prescribed for me to perform fifty prayers every day and every night. I descended to Moses (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Then he said: What has Allah prescribed for your community? I said: Fifty prayers. He said: Return to your Lord and ask him for relief. Your church will certainly not be able to do this, for I have already tested and tested the children of Israel. I then returned to my Lord and said: O my Lord! Make it easier for my community. So he reserved five prayers for me. I returned to Moses and said: Allah reserved five prayers for me. He (Moses) replied: Your church will not be able to do this. Return to your Lord and ask for relief! I did not stop walking between Allah, Blessed be He, and Moses until Allah said: There are five prayers every day and every night. Each prayer is equal to ten prayers and that makes fifty prayers. And whoever intends to perform a deed but does not carry it out will have it written down as a deed. But if he actually carries out the deed, it is written down for him as ten blessings.

            "Malik Ibn Sa'sa'a, may Allah be pleased with him, reported: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: I was half awake near the Ka'bah when I suddenly heard someone say: He is that one third among the two men. He then came to me and took me with him. Then he brought out a golden bowl filled with water from the well of Zamzam. He opened my heart to so and so. Qatada (a later narrator) said: I asked the one who was with me (i.e. the narrator) what the Prophet meant by (up to so and so). He replied: He meant that his heart was opened to the lower part of his stomach. The Prophet further said: My heart was taken out, washed with the water of the well of Zamzam and then put back, filling it with faith and wisdom. A white animal named Buraaq was brought here. This animal was larger than the donkey and smaller than the mule. His step was too big, as far as his eyes could see. I climbed onto it, then we walked until we got to the first sky. Then Gabriel commanded the gatekeeper of the gate of heaven: Open! He asked: Who is there? Gabriel replied: It is I, Gabriel. They then asked: Who is with you? He replied: Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. People further asked: Was he sent to him? He replied: Yes! The gatekeeper opened the gate for us and said: Welcome, O sincere newcomer! We came to Adam, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The narrator now continues the hadith himself: The prophet then met Jesus and John in the second heaven, may Allah bless and grant both of them. In the third he met Joseph; in the fourth Idris and in the fifth Aaron (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them). The Prophet then said: We then walked until we reached the sixth heaven. There I met Moses and greeted him. He said: Welcome, O pious fellow believer and sincere prophet. As we passed him he was crying. Then he was asked: What makes you cry? He replied: O Allah, this is a young man whom You have sent as a prophet after me. Nevertheless, his followers will enter paradise in greater numbers than mine. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) continued: Then we continued until we reached the seventh heaven and I went to Abraham. Then I saw four rivers, from whose sources flowed two visible and two invisible rivers. I said: O Gabriel! What are these rivers? He replied: The two invisible are two rivers in Paradise and the two visible are the Nile and the Euphrates. Afterwards, Al-Bait Al-Ma`mur (the much-visited, time-honored house) was raised in front of me. Then I asked: O Gabriel, what is that? He replied: This is Al-Bait Al-Ma'mur (the much-visited ancient house) into which seventy thousand angels enter every day, and when they go out from this house they never visit it again. I was then offered two drinking bowls. One contained wine and the other milk. I reached for the milk. Then I was told: You have chosen the right path! May Allah also show your followers the right path of the natural kind! Then I was prescribed fifty prayers daily.... (The Prophet then continued with the hadith).

On that day Allah will gather the people and tell them: Join the one to whom you have paid divine worship! So those who worshiped the sun will join him; and those who worshiped the moon joined it; and those who served the idols join them. Ultimately, what remains is this church and the hypocrites beneath it. Allah, Blessed and Exalted be He, then turns to them, but in a form different from that which they know, and says: I am your Lord! They reply: We take refuge from you in Allah and we will stay here until our Lord comes to us! Then we will recognize him! Allah then comes to them in the form they know and says: I am your Lord! They then say: Yes, you are our Lord! and they follow him. The bridge is then laid over both pits of hell. My followers and I will be the first to cross this bridge. On this day only the prophets can speak. They shout: O Allah, save us! Deliver us! In Hell there are sharp hooks that resemble the spines of the Sa'dan (a desert bush)! Have you ever looked at Sa'dan? The listeners replied: Yes! The Messenger of Allah continued: Indeed, the hooks in Hell are comparable to the thorns of Sa'dan! However - all Allah knows their dimensions! These sharp hooks pierce people according to their actions. The believer will escape these because of his good deeds. Others will be punished until they are released from hell by Allah. Finally, when Allah has completed the judgment of people and wants to save from Hell those people on whom Allah has mercy, He gives the order to the angels to take out of Hell those of them who have worshiped only Allah. These are those on whom Allah wants to have mercy, among those who say (There is no god but Allah). They (the angels) recognize the believers by the marks left on their bodies by prostration. The fire is allowed to consume the entire body, except for the traces of prostration, for Allah has forbidden the fire to consume these traces. These people then leave hell with burnt and blackened limbs. But then the water of life is poured upon them, and they grow and flourish like the seed that grows with the flood-carried mud. When Allah finally finishes accounting, all that will be left is a man facing the Hellfire. This is the last one from hell to enter paradise. He will say: O my Lord, turn away my face from the fire of hell! Its stench poisoned me and its flames burned me! He will then call on Allah as long as Allah wants him to call on him. Allah, Blessed and Exalted, will then say: If I grant you this wish, you will make another request! The man will reply: No, I will not make any further request.

Allah will then say to them: I am your Lord. Then they will say: We take refuge from you in Allah. We never put anything aside from Allah. And they will repeat this statement two or three times until some of them were almost about to make a U-turn. Allah will then say: Is there a sign between you and Him by which you can recognize Him? They will reply: Yes! The calf is exposed. There remains now none of those who voluntarily prostrated themselves before Allah without Allah allowing them to prostrate before Him. Those who prostrated themselves out of fear of people or to be looked at by them will be punished by Allah making their backs an unbending piece. Whenever they try to prostrate themselves, they fall backwards onto their backs. Then they will lift their heads and see Allah, who will appear to them in the form in which they first saw Him. He will say: I am your Lord. They will reply: Yes, You are our Lord. The bridge is then placed over hellfire and intercession is permitted. Then they will say: O Allah, save us! Save us! Then a man asked: O Messenger of Allah! What is this bridge? The Prophet replied: This is made of slippery mud, with hooks, pincers and spikes on it. Similar spikes can be found in Nagd called As-Sa`dan. The believers will pass like the blink of an eye, like the lightning, like the wind, like the birds, like the swift horses and like other riding animals. Some will be rescued and brought to safety, some will be scratched and released, and some will be thrown into hellfire. Finally, believers are saved by fire. By the One in Whose Hand is my life, there is none of you who supplicates Allah more fervently for the rights of his brothers who are in Hellfire than the believers on the Day of Resurrection. They will say: O our Lord! They fasted, prayed and performed the pilgrimage with us. It will then be said to them: Bring out (from Hellfire) those you know! So these people are kept out of hellfire; and they will bring out a great number of people partially consumed by fire, some to the middle of their legs, and some to their knees. The believers will then say: O our Lord! There is no one left of those whom your command concerns. Allah will say: Return and bring out those who have in their hearts the weight of a dinar of goodness! They will bring many people out of hell and say: O our Lord, we left no one left for Your commandment. Then Allah will say: Return and bring out those who have in their hearts the weight of a half-dinar of goodness. So they will bring out many people and say: O our Lord, we have not left any of those whom Your command concerns left. Allah will then say: Return and bring out those who have in their hearts the weight of an atom of goodness. So they bring out many people and say: O our Lord, we have left no one in there who has goodness in his heart.

Once it happened that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out with a group of his companions and headed for the bazaar of 'Ukaaz. At this time the Satans were prevented from bringing news from heaven and burning shooting stars were sent down upon them. So they returned to their people, who asked them, “What is the matter with you?” They (the Satans) replied: We were prevented from bringing news from heaven and burning shooting stars were sent down upon us. They (their people) replied: Something strange must have happened. Go around the world and find out what is preventing us from bringing the news of heaven! So they traveled all over the world, and a group of them, on their way to Tihama and aiming for the bazaar of 'Ukaaz, passed by the Prophet who was offering morning prayers with his companions in a palm garden. When they heard the Qur'an, they listened carefully and said: This is what has prevented us from bringing the news of heaven. They then returned to their people and said: O people! Verily we have heard a wonderful Quran that guides righteousness, so we have believed in it, and we will never associate anyone with our Lord [Quran 72:1-2].

At about midnight the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asleep, so that he leaned to one side on his mount. Then I came to him and supported him on his camel without waking him up. So he got up on his camel and rode on until the night was almost gone. Then he leaned to one side again and I propped him up on his camel again without waking him up. He rode on until just before dawn. Then he tilted again, but this time more than the previous two times, until he almost fell. I came to him and propped him up again. Then he raised his head and said: Who is this?

He said: May Allah preserve you, just as you preserved His Messenger! Then he said: Have we been separated from the others? Can you see any? I said: There is a rider. Then I said: There is another rider. We came together and there were seven of us. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood on one side of the path, bowed his head and said: Pay attention to the times of prayer. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the first to wake up with the sun visible behind his back. We woke up quickly. The Messenger said: Mount your camels! We mounted and rode until the sun was up. Then he got down and asked for a pot, which I had and in which there was a small amount of water. He performed ablution, but it was not comparable to his usual ablution. A little water still remained in the pot. Then he (the Prophet) said to Abu Qatada: Keep your pot, for it will play a wonderful role! Then Bilal called for prayer. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed two raqqahs and then the morning prayer as he used to do every day. Some of us began to whisper among ourselves, saying: What is the atonement for our neglect in prayer? Then the Messenger of Allah said: Do you not have an example in me? There is no neglect in sleeping. It is neglect if one does not perform the prayer until the next prayer comes. Whoever does this should perform the missed prayer as soon as he remembers it. But if he remembers it the next day, then he should perform it at the time of the same prayer. Then he said: What did the (other) people do? He said (Abu Qatada): When the people woke up, they found that they had lost their Prophet. Abu Bakr and 'Umar told them: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) should be behind you. He can't leave you behind him.

He replied: O Messenger of Allah, I am afflicted with ritual impurity. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded him to perform tayammum (dry ablution) with sand; and so he could perform the prayer. The Prophet then urged me to go immediately with some of my fellow passengers to look for water because we were very thirsty. On the way we met a woman with her feet dangling between two leather water bags. We asked them: Where can you find water? She replied: Very far from here, very far. You can't find water here. We further asked: How long is the distance between the dwellings of your tribe and the water? She replied: A journey of one day and one night. We said: You should go to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). She said: Who then should be the Messenger of Allah? We were then able to somehow take her with us to the Prophet. When she was in front of him, he asked her about her circumstances. She told him the same thing she had told us and told him that she was a widow and had orphans. He then ordered their camel to kneel down. The camel spat water into the upper openings of the two water bags and then stood up. We - forty thirsty men - drank until our thirst was completely quenched. We also filled all the water bags we had and let our friend, who was previously unclean, wash himself. But we didn't let the camel drink the water, even though the water bags almost burst from the water. The Prophet then said: Bring everything you have with you! So we collected pieces of bread and dates for them. The Prophet packed what he had gathered into a bundle, gave it to the woman and said to her: You must now go and feed your children with it. And you should also know that your water has not diminished in the slightest. When the woman returned to her tribe, she said: I have met the greatest sorcerer among men, or he is truly a prophet, as he claimed. And she told what happened.

Ibn 'Abbas replied: 'A'ishah. Go to her and ask her, then come back to me and tell me her answer to your questions. So I went to Hakim Ibn Aflah and asked him to guide me to her. He said: I will not go to her because I have warned her about involvement in the prevailing conflict between both groups. But she refused and expressed her opinion about it. But I demanded it from him with an oath and he finally complied with my wish. We went to 'A'ishah and asked permission to enter her. When we came in she said: Are you Hakim? She recognized him. He said: Yes! She said: Who is with you? He said: Sa`d Ibn Hisham. She said: Who is Hisham? He said: Ibn 'Amer. She invoked Allah's mercy on him and spoke well of him. (Qatada said that he was one of the martyrs of Uhud.) I said: O Mother of the Faithful! Tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). She replied: Don't you read the Koran? I told you! She said: The character of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the Qur'an. (That is, he behaved according to the Koran.) He said: Then I planned to get up and never ask for anything until I die. However, I changed my mind and said: Tell me about the nightly prayer of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). She replied: Do you not recite: O you veiled one? I replied: Yes! She further said: Allah, Exalted and Mighty, prescribed the night prayer at the beginning of this surah. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions performed this prayer for a year. However, Allah reserved the concluding verses of this surah in heaven for twelve months and sent them down at the end of that period, containing relief. Nighttime prayer has since become voluntary after being compulsory. He continued: I said: O Mother of the faithful! Tell me about the Witr prayer of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him! She said: We used to prepare his siwak and water for him. Allah caused him to wake up at the time He wanted to wake him up. He then cleaned his teeth with the stick, performed the ritual partial ablution and performed nine rakk'as, sitting only in the eighth. He remembered Allah, thanked Him, called upon Him and then stood up without saying the end of the prayer. He then performed the ninth raqqa, sat afterwards, remembered Allah, thanked Him and then recited the audible conclusion of the prayer. Then he performed two rakk'as and pronounced the conclusion while sitting. So these are eleven Rakk`as, my son. When he grew old, he performed nine Rakk'as for Witr prayer; first seven and then two, doing the same thing in the two Rakk'as as he used to do before. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wished to continually perform the prayer he used to perform. However, if he was prevented from performing the night prayers by sleep or pain, he would perform twelve voluntary rakk'as a day. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never read the entire Quran in a single night, prayed until morning in one night, or fasted for a whole month, except for Ramadan. He said: I then went to Ibn 'Abbas and told him what she had said. Then he said: She told the truth. If I could go to her or talk to her, I would have gone to her to hear it from her herself.

Heraclios asked: Is there anyone in this area who is one of the people of this man (Muhammad) who claims that he is a prophet? People said: Yes! Then I was called with some people from the tribe of Quraish; then we entered Heraklios. He made us sit before him and said to us: Who among you is closest in lineage to this man who claims to be a prophet? I said, that I! Then they made me sit in front of him and my companions behind me. He called for his interpreter and said to him, \"Tell them that I want to ask him questions about this man who says he is a prophet.\" If he (Abu Sufyan) doesn't tell me the truth, tell me he's lying! Abu Sufyan said: I swear by Allah, if the people who know the honesty of Muhammad did not accuse me of lying, I would definitely have lied. Heraclios said to his interpreter: Ask him: What is his lineage among you? I said: He (Muhammad) is of noble birth among us. Heraclios asked: Was one of his forefathers a king? I said no! He further asked: Did you accuse him of lying before he said what he announced? I said no! Heraclios said: Does the elite of men follow him or do the weak follow him? I said: The weak follow him! He said: Are their numbers increasing or decreasing? I said no! She's constantly gaining weight. He said: Did any of them renounce their faith after accepting it because of dissatisfaction with it? I said no! Heraclios said: Did you fight him? I said yes! He said: How was your fight against him? I said: The success of the fight was variable: we win one round and he wins the other. He asked: Is he breaking his agreement with you? I said no! But there is now an agreement between us. We don't know what he's going to do. I swear by Allah that I could not use any other word against him than this. Heraclios said: Has anyone before him made such a claim? I said no! Then Heraclios turned to his interpreter and said: Tell him: I asked you about his descent among you, and you said that he is of noble descent among you. The same is true of the messengers: these are usually chosen from among the nobles of their people. I also asked you whether there was a king among his forefathers, and you denied this. If there had been a king among his forefathers, I would assume that he would be a man who wanted to fight to regain the kingdom of his forefathers. I asked you about his followers, whether they are the elite or the weak, and you said that the weak follow him. These are always the followers of the messengers. I asked you if you accused him of lying before he said what he claimed and you said no. I did not think it possible that he would refrain from lying to people in order to fabricate a lie against Allah. I asked you if any of your followers resigned from their faith after accepting it because they were not satisfied with it, and you also said no. This is common for faith when it takes root in the joy of a person's heart. I asked you if the number of his followers is increasing or decreasing and you said it is increasing.

I said to him: He commands us to perform the prayer, pay the alms tax, maintain the ties of kinship, and maintain chastity. Heraclios said: If what you said about him is the truth, then he is a prophet. I already knew that a prophet was coming, but I did not assume that he would come from your side.

Then he (Abu Bakr) leftto the mosque to perform the night prayer with the Prophet, and then returned to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and stayed until the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fell asleep. He didn't come home until late at night. His wife received him with the words: \"What has kept you away from your guests for so long?\" He asked, \"Didn't you serve them dinner?\" She replied, \"They refused to eat until you got there! We offered it to them, but they didn't want to!\" I overheard this conversation. I quickly moved away to hide! But Abu Bakr was already shouting at me: \"Oh, you mean!\" He complained and raged. Then he said: \"Eat now, and may it not come to you! And I swear by Allah! I will never touch this food!\" We started eating. And I swear by Allah! We didn't take a bite from the plates without a bigger bite coming from below! This happened until everyone was full. And there was more food than before! Abu Bakr looked at the bowls in amazement. Really, there was as much food as when we started eating, or even more! Abu Bakr turned to his wife and asked her: \"O sister of Banu Firaas! What is happening here?\" She replied, \"Really, my darling, now it's three times as much as before!\" Then Abu Bakr also ate some of the food. He said, \"Surely it was the work of the devil!\" He was referring to his vow not to touch the food. He ate some more and then took the food to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), where it was kept until morning. There was a contract between us and some people regarding the care of the needy, which had expired at that time. Twelve men were appointed, each of whom was assigned some of these people - Allah knows best how many needy people there were for each of these men. In any case, they all ate from the dishes that were left over that evening! This is how the narrator reported this event.  [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Chapter 36, Ḥadīṯ no. 3833]",

Then Hafsa said to her, \"Don't you want to ride on my camel and let me ride on your camel so that each of us can look here and there?\" She replied, \"Yes!\" Then 'A'ishah rode on the camel of Hafsa and Hafsa rode on the camel of 'A'ishah. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to the camel of 'A'ishah on which Hafsa was riding, greeted her and continued his march until he was ready for a rest. Then 'A'ishah missed him (the Prophet) and became jealous.

And when he sleeps, he wraps himself completely. He never stretched out his hand to take care of me.\" The seventh wife said, \"My husband is ponderous, impotent and a fool. All the shortcomings and vices of this world are united in him. He hits me in the face so hard that he hurts it, breaks my bones, or even both at the same time.\" The eighth woman said: \"My husband smells like fragrant grass and feels soft and fluffy like a rabbit.\" The ninth Woman said: “Mine is a respected and tall man. He eats well and in abundance. And his house is a center of social life.” The tenth wife reported: “My husband is very rich and respected. I don't know any other rich man who has anything better. He owns many camels, which are kept in stables; only a few of them are taken out to pasture. When the camels in the stable hear the sound of the people, they know that their slaughter is imminent.\" The eleventh woman said: \"My husband is Abu Zar'! What a wonderful man he is! He made sure my ears were adorned with heavy jewelry and my upper arms gained fat. He made me so happy that I could be happy with myself. I come from a rural family that keeps sheep and goats (i.e. my family was poor). But he led me into a house where the horses neighed and the camels groaned under the burden they had to carry. The sound of the threshing and cleaning of the grain can always be heard (there is wealth and abundance in Abu Zar's house). And whatever I say to Abu Zar`, he does not blame me. I sleep late into the day and drink until I've had enough. And Abu Zar's mother! What a wonderful woman Abu Zar's mother is! Her storage bags are full to the brim and her house is very spacious! The son of Abu Zar`! What a wonderful son the son of Abu Zar` is! His sleeping place is as narrow as the blade of a sword (that is, a very slim man, which corresponds to the ideal of beauty.) He is already full after eating the forefoot of a four-month-old sheep. The daughter of Abu Zar`! What a wonderful daughter the daughter of Abu Zar` is. She obeys her father and mother. She fills out her dress beautifully and her neighbor envies her for it. And Abu Zar's servant! What a wonderful servant the servant of Abu Zar` is! She doesn't spread stories about our home, she doesn't waste supplies, or make a mess. One day Abu Zar` left our house. It was at the time when the milk hoses were churned to make butter. He met a woman with two boys who resembled cheetahs and were playing with pomegranates. Then he divorced me and married this woman. I then married a respected and generous man who rode an excellent horse and always carried a lance. He gave me many gifts, he gave me a pair of all the grazing animals and said: Eat, O Umm Zar', and take care of your own! But even if I add up everything he gave me, it still does not equal the most insignificant utensil that Abu Zar' gave me.\" 'A'ishah added to her report: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). him, said to me: \"O 'A'isha, I am to you as Abu Zar was to Umm Zar!\" [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Chapter 44, Ḥadīṯ no. 4481]",

Then I said, “You have spoiled your previous good deeds to us. What you said caused the separation between us and you from now on.” We then began to prepare our camels. As we rode on it, my uncle covered himself with his robe (out of shame) and wept profusely. We left and stayed near Makkah. Then Unais made a bet with a man for our camels and an equal number of camels, and the two of them went to a fortune teller. The fortune teller let the lot decide between the two, and the lot fell on Unais. Later he came to us with our camels and an equal number of camels from the bet he won. Abu Dharr further narrated: \"I said to my nephew, 'I had been praying for three years before I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).'

I said, \"To Allah.\" He said, \"Which direction did you turn when you prayed?\" I said, \"In the direction that Allah made me turn.\" The last part of the night was so managed that I fell like a robe, and I slept until the sun was in the sky. Unais said, “I have business to attend to in Makkah. Stay here and wait for me.” Unais walked until he reached Makkah. Then he came to me late. I said, “What were you doing there?” He replied, “In Makkah I met a man who belonged to your religion.

I found that there was no way anyone could do something similar. I swear by Allah that he spoke the truth and they are the real liars. Then I said, \"Stay here and wait for me until I go there to take a closer look at the matter.\" So I arrived at Makkah and asked a man whom I considered weak, \"Where is this man? whom they call the Sabean.” Then he pointed at me and said, “The Sabean!” All the people present attacked me. They beat me with dried earth and bones until I fainted. Later I stood up like an idol stained with blood. Then I came to the fountain of Zamzam and cleansed myself of the blood and drank its water. There I remained, O my nephew, thirty days. My food was none other than the water of Zamzam. I became so obese that wrinkles appeared on my stomach and I felt no hunger. When the people of Makkah were sleeping soundly on a moonlit night, so that no one walked around the Ka'bah. But there were two women of them who prayed for Isaf and Na'ilah. As they walked around the Ka'bah, they passed me. Then I said, “Why don’t you marry the two of them?” When they had finished praying, they passed me again. Then I said: “You are like a piece of wood.

I worked as a shepherd and made a living. When I brought the animals back, I milked them and brought the milk to my parents first. They drank until they had enough. Only then did I give my children some of the milk. One day I had to go to a far away place to find a pasture. That's why I didn't return until the evening. When I got home, my parents were already asleep. I milked the animals as I did every day and stood in front of them with the milk container. I was reluctant to wake her up. But I was also reluctant to give the children milk in front of them. My children complained about being hungry, but I didn't give them anything. We stayed like that until dawn broke. O Allah, if you know that I have done this only in pursuit of your favor, then open the way for us out of this cave so that we can see the sky again!” Then the boulder moved a little to the side so that they could see it could see sky. The other said: “O Allah my God, you know that I had a cousin on my father's side whom I loved as a man can only love a woman. I desired her and she said she would only comply with my desire if I gave her a hundred gold pieces. I had to work a lot until I got the money together.

'A'ishah further reported: One day he again drew lots between us because he wanted to go on a campaign, and the lot fell on me. Shortly afterwards we set out and I was with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The verse about the veil had already been revealed then. I was carried in a camel litter, and when we stopped, I was lifted off the camel in this litter. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished the campaign, we headed home. We were not far from Madina when he ordered that we should ride at night. The order to leave was given and I left the camp to relieve myself. I was almost back when I realized that my Yemeni agate necklace had come undone and I had lost it. I went back to look for her. That's why I was stopped back then. Meanwhile, the people who were preparing my camel for departure went to my sedan chair and secured it to the camel. They thought I was sitting in the sedan chair. Back then, women were generally very slim, not as heavy or full (as they are today), because they only eat a little! Therefore, when they lifted the palanquin, they did not notice that I was not sitting in it because of the weight of the palanquin. I was also still a very young woman back then! The camel was driven and the people left. By the time I found my necklace, the caravan had already moved away. I returned to the campsite and no one was there. I went to the place where my palanquin was and sat there, thinking that they would soon notice my absence and turn back. As I sat there waiting, my eyes closed and I fell asleep. Safwaan Ibn Al-Mu'attal As-Sulamy Az-Zakwany had stayed behind the caravan to get some sleep. In the morning he reached the campsite where I had stayed. He saw that a person dressed in black was lying there and came up. He had seen me many times before the revelation of the verse about the veil, so he could easily recognize me. I woke up when he shouted: “We live for Allah and to Him we will return!” I immediately covered my face with my outer garment. By Allah, he said nothing other than the formula: “We live for Allah and to Him we will return!” He dismounted and held his camel so that I could mount it. Then he went forward and led the camel by the reins. We reached the Prophet's caravan as it was resting at the height of the midday heat. Some of the people speculated about my reasons for staying back and made slanderous accusations. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul particularly stood out for his lying talk. A little later we returned to Madina. I fell ill and was confined to bed for a month. At that time, those slanderous accusations were widespread, but I had no idea about them. However, during my illness, I felt that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not show me the same kindness as he did when I was sick. He (the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him))visited me, said the greeting and asked how I was, saying: “How are you?” And that worried me. I didn't know about all the terrible rumors until I felt better and went with Umm Mistah to Al-Manase' to relieve myself. We always did this at night. At that time there were no toilets near our houses and we followed the custom of the ancient Arabs, that is, we moved away from the built-up and cultivated area to relieve ourselves. The Arabs at that time detested having toilets in their houses. Umm Mistah was the daughter of Abu Glory Ibnal Mottalib Ibn 'Abd Manaf. Her mother was the daughter of Sakhr Ibn 'Amer and the maternal aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq. Their son was Mistah Ibn Uthatha Ibn 'Abbad Ibnal Mottalib. I walked there with the daughter of Abu Glory. When we had finished and were heading back, Umm Mistah stumbled over her dress and exclaimed angrily: \"Mistah may perish!\" I said: \"That's not right what you're saying! Are you insulting a man who took part in the Battle of Badr?\" She said, \"Oh, don't you know what he is saying?\" And she told me about the slanderous accusations that were made against me. I fell ill again. After I returned home, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to see me. He greeted me and said, “How are you?” I said to him, “Allow me to go to my parents!” I wanted to check with them about the rumors. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave me his permission. I went to my parents and asked my mother, “What is it that people are talking about?” She replied, “Oh, dear daughter, don’t worry about it! By Allah, it has never happened before that an attractive woman who is loved by her husband is not showered with resentment and jealousy by his concubines!\" I shouted: \"Praise be to Allah! And people just talk about it!” But the following night I cried constantly and couldn’t sleep. When morning came, I was still crying. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) summoned 'Ali Ibn Abu Talib and Usama Ibn Zaid. He wanted to ask her opinion as to whether he should divorce his wife or not, since no revelation had been made on the matter. Usama pointed out to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he had great affection for the Prophet's family, expressed his opinion about her innocence, and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, she is your wife and we know only good things about them!\" 'Ali Ibn Abu Talib said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Allah has given you a free hand and there are many other women. But ask her servant. She will tell you the truth.\" The Messenger of Allah, Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, sent to Barira, her servant, and said to her: \"O Barira, did you notice anything in 'A'ishah that seemed suspicious to you?\" She replied: \"No, by the one who sent you sent with the truth. I have never observed anything that I could blame her for. The most I could say is that she is still very young and sometimes she leaves the dough and sleeps - and then the goat comes and eats it.\" On the same day, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mounted the pulpit and asked those gathered asked whether anyone would assist him if he wanted to punish 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said while standing on the pulpit: “O Muslims, who will help me when I punish a man who expressed serious suspicions against my family? By Allah, I only know good things about my wife. And a man is being blamed who I can only say good things about. He never entered my house without me being there.\" Sa'd Ibn Mu'az Al-Ansary stood up and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I assist you. When this 'Abdullah is out of the tribe, we will cut off his head. But if he is one of our brothers from the tribe of Khazrağ, then tell us what we should do and we will obey your command.” Then Sa'd Ibn 'Ubada, the head of the tribe of Khazrağ, jumped up. He was a righteous man, but at that moment anger seized him and he shouted at Sa`d Ibn Mu`az: “You are lying, by Allah, the Eternal. You won't kill him. You will not succeed.\" Then Usaid Ibn Hudair, cousin of Sa'd Ibn Mu'az, also jumped up and shouted: \"By Allah, you are a liar. By Allah, the Eternal, we will definitely kill him. You are a hypocrite who defends the hypocrites.” Then the Aus and Khazrağ became so angry that they started to fight with each other. Meanwhile, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood on the pulpit. He continued to talk to both parties until they finally calmed down again. And he didn't talk to them about it anymore. I cried all day long. My tears continued to flow, and the following night I couldn't sleep again. My parents thought it would break my heart. While my parents sat with me and I cried, a woman from the Ansar asked to be let in. I let her enter. She sat down and cried with me. Such were the circumstances when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered and settled down. He hadn't sat down with me since the day the allegations against me were first made. A whole month had passed in which he had had no revelations that could have given him clarity on this matter. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke the creed and then said to me: “O 'A'isha, I have been told this and that about you. If you are innocent, Allah will absolve you of all guilt. But if you are guilty, ask Allah for forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. For if a servant of Allah confesses his wrongdoings and repents of them, Allah will turn to him again.\" After the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said this, my eyes stopped watering. I didn't feel a single tear anymore. I said to my father: \"Answer the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on my behalf.\" But he replied: \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Then I turned to my mother with the same request, but she also said: \"By Allah, I don't know what I could say to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.\" I was a very young one then woman and didn't know the Koran very well. I said: “By Allah, I know that you listen to the slanderous talk of the people. It's stuck in your mind and you believe it. And when I say that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you do not believe me. But if I admitted guilt when Allah knows that I am innocent, then you would believe me. By Allah, I can only compare my situation with that of Joseph(Yusuf) father compared when he said: \" (I must be patient and call upon Allah for help against what you say.) \" \"After these words, I turned away from them and lay down in bed. At that time I hoped that Allah would confirm my innocence. By Allah, I never imagined that a revelation would come because of me. I'm far too unimportant for anything to be said in the Koran because of me. But I hoped that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have a dream in his sleep in which Allah would confirm my innocence. But, by Allah, while the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was still sitting with us and no one had moved away, a revelation came from Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, about His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She seized him with such strength as comes to him in such cases, that the sweat from his brow dripped down like pearls on a severely cold day. That was because of the meaning of Revelation. When the revelation was over, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled. And the first thing he said to me afterwards was: “O 'A'isha, rejoice in the good news! Allah has confirmed your innocence.\" My mother said: \"A'ishah, get up and thank the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!\" I replied: \"No, by Allah. I will not do that. Only Allah will I praise, who has confirmed my innocence by a revelation.\" Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, had revealed the following ten verses: \"Those who have uttered the monstrous lie are a (certain) group of you. Don't think it's bad for you; no! Rather, it is good for you. Each of them will receive what he has acquired through sin. And for the one among them who took the brunt of it, there will be tremendous punishment. ... \" \" If only, when you heard it, the believing men and women had had a good opinion of each other and said: \"This is clearly a monstrous lie!\" \" \" If only they had brought four witnesses about it! But since they did not bring the witnesses have, then they are liars with Allah. \" \" And were it not for Allah's grace towards you and His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, you would suffer a tremendous punishment for what you indulged in (extensively)\" \" as you did with yours You have taken up tongues and said with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, and considered it a light thing, whereas with Allah it is a tremendous thing.\" \"And if you had said, when you heard it, \" It It is not our place to speak about it. Praise be to You! This is a tremendous slander\"! « »Allah warns you never to do such things again if you are believers. « » And Allah makes the signs clear to you, and Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise. « » Those who love the abomination to spread among those who believe, for them there will be a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. Allah knows, but you do not know. \" \" And without the grace of Allah towards you and His mercy, and that Allah would not be Gracious and Merciful... \" After Allah, The Almighty and Exalted, had proven my innocence with these ten verses, Abu Bakr said As-Siddiq, Allah Happy is he who provided a living for Mistah Ibn Uthatha, one of the slanderers, because he was related to him. Thereupon he was poor: \"By Allah, I will never again give anything to Mistah after what he did to 'A'ishah.\" Then Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, revealed: \"And those of you who have abundance and wealth shall , not swearing that they will no longer give to relatives, the poor, and those who have emigrated in the way of Allah, but rather they should forgive and be lenient. Don't you love that Allah forgives you? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. \" Hebban Ibn Musa said, 'Abdullah Ibnal Mubarak said: \"This is the most hopeful verse in the Book of Allah.\" When Abu Bakr heard this revelation, he said: \"Yes, by Allah, I want Allah to forgive me .\" And he continued to support Mistah and said: \"I will never stop giving him alms.\" 'A'ishah further reported: Before the revelation of my innocence was made, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also had Zainab Bint Gahsh, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), was asked about me. She replied then: “O Messenger of Allah, I have always kept my ears and eyes open. But, by Allah, I only know good things about 'A'ishah.\" It was Zainab from the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who vied with me for the favor of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But she was a righteous and God-fearing woman. But her sister Hamna bint Gahsh took action on her behalf, so she told this big lie. [Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, Chapter 49, Ḥadīṯ No. 4974]",

He went to the leper and asked: “What would you like most?” He answered: “A beautiful color and pretty skin and healing from this disease that made people avoid me.” The angel ran his hand over his body , and his illness disappeared and his body became a beautiful color. Then the angel further asked him, \"What possession would you most like to have?\" The man said, \"Camels (or cows - the narrator is not sure here) .\" The man was then given a pregnant she-camel, and the angel said, “May Allah bless them for you.” Then he went to the bald man and asked him, “What do you want most?” The man replied, “Beautiful hair and replacement for what is missing, which is why people despise me.” The angel departed with his hand (over his head), and his illness was cured and he got beautiful hair. Then the angel asked him, \"What possession would you most like to have?\" The man said, \"Cattle!\" and a pregnant cow was given to him, and the angel said, \"May Allah bless her for you!\" Then the angel came to the man who was blind and asked him, \"What would you most like?\" He said, \"That Allah would restore my sight to me so that I can see the people around me.\" The angel stroked his hand over his eyes, and Allah restored his sight. Then the angel asked him, “What possession would you most like to have?” The man said, “Goats!” and a pregnant goat was given to him. These animals gave birth to their young, and soon one had a valley full of camels, another a valley full of cows, and the third a valley full of goats.

I ask you, in the name of Him who gave you a pleasant color and fair skin and wealth, to provide me with a camel to complete my journey.\" He answered, \"I have many obligations to fulfill.\" Then the angel said: “It seems to me that I have seen you before.
