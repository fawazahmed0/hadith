1-) This (previous) hadith (exactly) as narrated by al-Leys, from Nafi (as a merfû) through Musa, from Hatim b. İsmail and Yahya b. Ayyub also narrated:
1-) Miqats of hajj are also miqats of umrah. Where ihram is entered for hajj, ihram is also entered for umrah. However, those in Mecca go out of the Harem area and enter the ihram for the hill area from the ci'rane or Ten'im locations. We have explained the details of this issue in the commentary of the hadiths numbered 1737-1742.
1-) Mut'a marriage is done with words that come from the root mut'a, such as "temette'tu biki sharen: I am marrying you for a month to benefit from you". Provisional marriage, on the other hand, is performed with words such as "nekahtü: I got married", "I accepted zevvectü to be married".
1-) Kinship: The guardian of a free woman in marriage is her own father. Imam Shafii and Imam Ahmad are of the same opinion. This is the famous view of Imam Abu Hanifa. Malik, Abu Yusuf, Ishak b. According to Rahûye and İbnu'l-Münzir, if there is a guardian of the woman, it is her own son. The son is more worthy of guardianship than the father. There is a narration that Abu Hanifa also held this view. Because the son comes before the father in terms of inheritance and is considered as ababe in the first degree. The evidence of Imam Shafii and his supporters, who represent this view, is as follows: Father is more perfect in vision and superior in compassion. In this respect, it is necessary to present the father to the son as well as to the grandfather in terms of custody. In addition, just as the father is given the right to be the guardian of the child in cases such as minority, debauchery, and depravity, the father should also be given the right of guardianship in matters other than marriage and marriage. If there is no father, the right of guardianship belongs to the grandfather before the son. Imam Shafii is of this opinion. There is a narration that Imam Ahmad also held this view. According to another narration, Imam Ahmed is of the opinion that in the absence of a natural father, the right of guardianship will pass to the natural son before the grandfather. Malik and Abu Yusuf, Ishak b. Rahuye and Ibn al-Mundhir also share this second view of Imam Ahmad. According to a third opinion from Imam Ahmad, if there is a natural father, the right of guardianship is given to the brother first. Because grandfather is the father of the father. The brother is the father's son. In other words, one draws its power from fatherhood and the other from sonship. The paternity state is always presented and preferred to the sonship state. There is a narration that Imam Malik also held this view. There is also a narration from Imam Ahmed that grandfather and brother are equal in guardianship at the marriage contract. The evidence of Imam Shafii and his supporters, who said, "When there is no father in the marriage contract, the right of guardianship belongs to your grandfather" is this: Because the father is the child of the grandfather, he also has the right to be asabe. In this respect, if there is no father in the marriage contract, the grandfather takes his place before the son and brother. It is also known that the brother inherited when he was with the grandfather, the son and the son of the son. Therefore, the grandfather's right to be the guardian - no matter how high - comes before all the arrogance except the father. The right of priority to guardianship among dedes is like the right of priority in inheritance. If the woman does not have a father or her father's father, the right of guardianship firstly passes to her son, and if there is no son, the son's son, provided that the degree of kinship is compatible. The Hanafi scholars, Imam Malik and Imam Ahmed are of this opinion. According to her, a woman's son and her son's son-do not have the right of guardianship. However, he may have the right to be a guardian in the marriage of his mother as a judge or a mawla. The evidence of the Hanafi scholars and supporters, who say that if the father is not present, the child will acquire the right of guardianship, is the following hadith: When Umm Salama's iddah was over, Abu Bakr (radiyallahu anh) wanted to marry her by sending a message. But Umm Salama refused. Then the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) 'Umar b. He sent al-Khattab to propose marriage. Umm Salama said to Hadrat Umar, "Tell the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) that I am a jealous woman. Then I have children. I do not have any relatives to consult him on this matter." Hadrat Umar came to the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) and narrated the answer of Umm Salama. Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam): say, “I am a very jealous woman”. I will pray to Allah for this and your jealousy will go away. You say "I have children". (Don't worry) God will help them. As for his statement, "I have no relatives to consult with him," he said, "No one among his relatives, whether they are here or not, does not regard this marriage badly. " Get up and marry me to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). Nesai, nikah 28 If a woman has no fathers or sons, according to Hanafis, imams Shafii and Malik, a woman's parent and one brother gain the right to be a guardian. This is the authentic opinion of Imam Ahmad. According to Ahmed's famous opinion, on this subject; father is like a brother, parents are like a brother. This is the view of Abu Sevr and the old view of Imam Shafii. Because, according to them, a father is equal to a brother and a parent to a brother in aggression. For this reason, they ruled that the right to marriage should also be equal. However, this view has been rejected by others. If the parents do not have a real brother, then the right of guardianship is transferred to the sons of his own brother, to the sons of his sons, if they do not exist, to the uncle of the woman, if he does not have it, to his sons, his sons-sons in turn. If they have the same degree of closeness and one is related from the point of view of the parents and the other is related only from the aspect of the father, those who are related by both the mother and the father are preferred to those who are related only from the father's point of view. According to the well-known narration from Abu Hanifa, a woman who does not have a nervous system is her relatives, such as her parents, mother, sister, aunt, or male relatives such as a mother's brother, maternal uncle, mother's uncle. On this subject, Kâsânî says the following: If the woman does not have asabi, all her relatives, male or female, will be the guardians of the woman. However, if they are the heirs of the person to be married, they acquire the right of guardianship according to the order of preference in the inheritance. II, 240.

2-) Cutting veins, removing teeth etc. It is also permissible to resort to remedies such as ihram. However, while doing these, it is essential to avoid things such as applying perfume and cutting hair, which are pleasing to the person with ihram.
2-) This hadith is related to Musa b. Tarik, Musa b. He narrated it from Ibn Umar through Uqba.
2-) According to Hanafi scholars, the conditions of Umrah are four: Ihram: Ihram means to temporarily prohibit some of the things that are permissible for performing Hajj or Umrah, or both, to refrain from doing them, which means intending for Hajj or Umrah or both, and "Labbayk". It can be done by saying "Allahumma labbayk", as well as by putting a leash around the neck of a dhikr or sacrificial body that replaces talbiyah with the intention. Zihni, Ni'met-i Islam, 614. Entering ihram is not a condition of Umrah but a pillar of it, according to other madhhabs except Hanafi. Circulating the Kaaba: According to Hanafis, its four shawts, and according to Imam Shafii, Malik and Ahmed, seven rounds of circumambulation are the pillars of Umrah. According to Hanafis, the remaining three shawts are varib. Ps'y between Safa and Marwa: According to Imam Shafii and Imam Malik and Ahmed, performing sa'y between Safa and Marwa is the pillar of Umrah. According to Hanafi scholars, it is one of the wâjibs of Umrah. Because Abdullah b. Abi Awfa said: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) intended to perform Umrah. When he came to Mecca, he circumambulated the Bayt-i-Sharif. We circumambulated in Bzz, then he came to Safa and Marwa to perform sa'y, and we came to Safa and Marwa with him." Hadith number 1903. Shaving: Shaving or getting a haircut is a pillar of Umrah according to the Shafi'i sect. According to other sects other than the Shafi'i school, it is one of the wâjibs of Umrah because Ibn Abbas (radiyallahu anh) said that Hadrat Muawiya shortened the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) hair with scissors on the Marwa Hill during an Umrah. To follow the order as the Messenger of Allah did, rukn according to the Shafi'i sect, is wajib according to other madhhabs.
2-) Having a concubine: the right to be a guardian in marriage is given to her master. If his master is not alive, this right passes to his followers in order according to the degree of strength. The ulama agreed on this issue.
2-) In mut'a marriage, there is no need for a witness and the determination of a certain time. But these are essential in a temporary marriage. As both of them are false, Kemalüddin b. Humam counted the two as one. A temporary marriage is not considered a temporary marriage on the condition that it falls empty after one month. Because in this case, the condition that the woman should be vacant after a month or more becomes invalid, and the marriage remains. Hadrat Ammar says: I asked Ibn Abbas whether a mut'a marriage is adultery or is it really a marriage? I asked him, and he replied, "It is not adultery, nor is it a marriage." "And what is it?" said. He replied, "Muta' Allahu ta'ala is as described in the 24th verse of an-Nisa (4), "Then, give them the wages deducted as a right, no matter how much you have benefited from them." This woman should wait for iddah after divorce. I asked, "Yes, it is a period of menstruation." I said, "Will they inherit one another?" He replied, "No." According to the explanation, Mut'a is a person's marriage to a woman in the presence of two witnesses, with the permission of the woman's guardian, for a certain period of time and in return for a mahr they have agreed upon, without the right of inheritance. When the appointed time expires, the woman leaves and the man cannot keep her. He can only ask her to wait for her iddat. Because the child to be born from this marriage is his. „. A man has no right to a child born from his marriage. same place.

3-) The wâjibs and sunnahs of umrah are just like the wâjibs and sunnahs of pilgrimage in ihram, circumambulation and sa'y. However, there are some differences between Umrah and Hajj. It is as follows: While there is an alliance when hajj is fard, there is no alliance when umrah is fard. . Although there is a specific time for Hajj, there is no time allocated for Umrah. Umrah can be performed every day of the year, except the day of Arafa and the four days of Eid-al-Adha. Actions such as making a foundation in Arafat and Muzdalifah, stoning the devil in Minâ, reciting sermons, kudum and farewell circumambulation are not included in Umrah.
3-) To liberate the concubine: if a concubine who has been reunited does not have relatives called asabe, the right of guardian in marrying her goes to her former master, who liberated her.

Among these asaba, it gives priority according to the order in the inheritance.

20-) Ibn Abbas (radiyallahu anh) said: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was passing by two graves: Look, be careful, they are tormented. Nor is the cause of their torment a great thing; He would not abstain from urinating, and this one would be a swan." Then he wanted a fresh palm branch to split it in two, planted one piece on one of the graves and the other on the other, and said, "Unless these branches dry up, I hope that the torment will be lightened from them. In his narration, Hennad said "he wouldn't cover" instead of "he wouldn't be afraid". voodoo 57; Muslim, taharah 34; Tirmidhi, tahara 53; Nesai, tahara 5; Ibn Mâce, tahfire 26.

Then he broke his wudu by hiding (behind) him. We said, "Look carefully, our Prophet is performing (breaking) ablution by sitting (and hiding) like women." Ekrem (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) heard this and said: Do you not know what happened to one of the Israelites? When they got on (their clothes), they would cut off the part where the urine hit. So, a person from Bani Israel forbade them from this (cutting the place where the urine touches). As a result, he was tortured in the grave (because it caused the urine to stay on the clothes, thus preventing them from doing the right thing)." Tahare 25; Ibn Mace, Tahare 26; Ahmed b. Hanbal, IV. 196; VI, 27.

83-) The difference between the bab title and this bab title; there is an order to make farewell circumambulation, and here it is told that the Prophet performed bi'l-fiil farewell circumambulation. For this reason, Abu Dawud dealt with the subject in two separate chapters.
87-) Abu Halde said: I asked Abu Aliye: Can a person who is junub but has no water other than nabiz to take a ghusl with nabiz? He answered no. For information, see the explanation of hadith 84.
95-) According to what is reported from Anas (radiy-Allâhu anh), he said: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) used to make wudu with two ritls of water (a container that takes it) and make ghusl with one sa' (full) of water." 50.51; Nesai, tahara 58, 143; miyah 13; Tirmidhi, jannah 76; Dârimî, voodoo 23; Ahmed b. Hanbal, III, 112, 116, 259, 282, 290. Dâvûd says: This hadith-i sherîf at the same time, it was narrated from Yahya b. Adem Sharik. He referred the hadith by saying, "From Atik". Again, the same hadith is from Abdullah b. Abdullah informed me that he said," and narrated that he said. He said, "Without mentioning two ritls, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) used to perform ablution with one makkuk water." Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad ibn Hanbal saying that one sa' is five ritl." Dawud said: Indeed, this amount of sa' is Ibn Abi Zi'b's sa'. Ibn Abi Zi'b'in sa' is also the Prophet's sa'.
105-) Abu Maryam said: I heard Abu Huraira (radiyallahu anh) say that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: When one of you wakes up, he should not put his hand in my bowl without washing his hands three times. For he does not know where his hand is at night, or where it wanders."
106-) Osman b. Humran b. Eban said: I am Osman b. I saw Affan performing ablution. First he poured water on his hands three times and washed them, then he took water in his mouth and rinsed them, then he poured water into his nose and threw it out, then he washed his face three times, then he washed his right hand together with his elbow three times and his left hand in the same way. When he washed it, he said: I saw the Messenger of Allah make wudu just like I did and heard him say: Whoever makes wudu like I do, and prays two rak'ahs with nothing in his heart, Allah will forgive his past sins. ,4, 8; Nesai, tahâre, 67, 68, 93; İbn Mâce, tahâre 6; Ahmed b. Hanbal, I, 50, 64, 66, 68, 71. Salama b. Abdirrahman reports that Humran said to him: : I saw Uthman ibn Affan performing ablution" . Continuing the narration of Abu Salama, Ata b. He narrated the same hadith that Yazid narrated from Humran. However, istinsâr is mentioned in "Mazmaza ve istinşâkî" copies. did not mention. In this hadith he narrated from Humran, Abu Salama said the following: Uthman (radiy-Allâhu anh) wiped his head three times and then washed his two feet three times. And he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) say that I was making wudu like this, and he (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) said: Whoever washes less than this number, this wudu is sufficient for him. In this narration, Abu Salama did not mention that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) prayed after wudu. I witnessed that Affan was asked about wudu. He asked for water. A water container was brought to him. Then he bent the container and poured it (from the water in it) on his right hand and washed his hands. Three times he put water into his nose, three times he washed his face. Then he washed his right hand three times and his left hand (up to his wrists) three times. Then, dipping his hand and scooping the water, he wiped his head and ears. He wiped the inside and outside of his ears once. finally And they washed their feet and said, "Where are those who ask me about wudu? That's how I saw the Messenger of Allah making wudu." Dawud said: "All of the authentic hadiths narrated by Uthman indicate that the head will be wiped once. Although the narrators of the hadith of Uthman say that wudu is done by washing each limb three times in their narrations. They did not mention how many times the head will be anointed, just like the other limbs. He poured water into his nose three times and threw it out. Abu Alkame said that Hadrat Uthman washed his ablution organs three times and continued as follows: Hadrat Uthman then wiped his head and then washed both his feet and said: I was the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). I saw that the sallam (sallam) was making wudu just like I did." Then, Ubaydullah, who narrated this hadith from Abu Alkama, recited the same hadith (number 106) of Zuhri to the end. b. He said from Salama: I am Osman b. After washing his wrists three times and wiping his head three times, I saw Affan say: This is what the Messenger of Allah did." Dawud said: You narrated this hadith from Veki at the same time from Israel. "Hazrat Uthman (radiyallahu anh) washed his ablution organs with three ticks each." Hayr said: Ali (radiyallahu anh) stopped by us one day and prayed. Then he asked for water for ablution. "He will do it," we said. However, his purpose was nothing but to teach us something. Finally, a bowl containing wudu water and a bowl were brought. First he poured the bowl on his right hand and washed both his hands three times. Then he poured water into his mouth and nose three times and threw it out. He gave water to his mouth and nose (the captain) with the hand from which he took water. Then he washed his face three times and his right and left hands three times each. Then he dipped his hand into the vessel and wiped his head once. Then wash his right and left feet three times. his name and then he said: Whoever will be happy to learn about the ablution of the Messenger of Allah, this is his ablution itself. Tahare 93, 94, 95; Tirmidhi, Tahare 44, 48; Hayr said: Ali (radiyallahu anh) came to the place called Rahbe in Kufa after performing the morning prayer and asked for some water for wudu. Then a boy brought a bowl and a bowl with water in it." Hayr continued his words: Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) took the bowl in his right hand, poured the water on his left hand and washed both his hands three times. He gave water to his nose." Then, zaide, one of the narrators of this hadith, continued his narration by quoting words similar to the previous hadith of Abu Avana: Then Ali (radiyallahu anh) wiped the front and back of his head once." Tahara, 93, 94, 95; Tirmidhi, 44, 48; b. Urfuta said, I heard Abdu Hayr say: I (once) heard Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) in Kufa. A seat was brought to him and he sat on it. Then a jug was brought to him. First he washed his hands three times and poured a handful of water into his mouth and nose." tahara 93-94, 95; Tirmidhi, tahara 44, 48. b. According to Amr's narration, Zirr b. Hubaysh said, "I heard Ali being asked about the Messenger of Allah's making wudu" and narrated the hadith (above). (During this transmission) Zirr continued his words as follows: Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) wiped his head so that no water would drip, he washed his feet three times, and this was how the Messenger of Allah did his ablution." b. Abi Layla said: Ben Ali I saw him (radiy-Allâhu anh). According to the narration of Ishaq, Abu Hayya said, "I saw Ben Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) making wudu," and he related that he washed each of his organs for ablution three times, and said: "Then he wiped his head, then washed his feet up to his heels". i Ali (radiyallahu anh): I wanted to show you how the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) performed wudu..." According to the narration of al-Havlani, Ibn Abbas (radiyallahu anh) said: One day, Ali b. Abi Talib broke his wudu and entered the place where I was and asked for water. We brought him a vessel containing water and set it before him. Ali said to me, "O Ibn Abbas, shall I show you how the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) performed ablution?" And I said, "yes, show me". Thereupon, he first bent the bowl over his hand and washed his (right) hand well. Then he immersed his right hand in water and washed it with the other (left) hand. Then he washed both his hands up to his ankles. Finally, after pouring water into his mouth and nose, he plunged both hands into the container and filled it with water, hitting his face. He tucked one of his thumbs into the inside of his right ear and the other into the inside of his left ear. He did the same in the second and third washes of his face. He took a handful of water with his right hand and poured it onto his forehead so that it could flow over his face, and washed his arms three times each, with his elbows. He wiped his head and the outside of his ears. He immersed his hands in the water, grabbed both his hands full of water, poured it on his shoelace and rubbed it. He did the same to his other foot. (Ibn Abbas) said: I (to Ali); while nalili huh! ' I said. (He also said): Yes, he said (then again) when he was in Nalin, I said, "While he was in Nalin?" I said, "Yes! (Then again) I said, "While I was from Nalin?" He replied, "Yes! While in Nalinli". Dawud said: Ibn Jurayc's narration from Shayba is similar to the hadith of Nasai tahara 78. However, while the hadith narrated by Hajjaj from Ibn Jurayc is stated in Nasai, Tahare 78: "He wiped his head once", the (same) hadith narrated by Ibn Jurayc from Ibn Jurayc see Beritil-Machud II, 296 It is said in .: He wiped three times". Since Wahb is a pedagogical narrator, it means that his narration has no value compared to other authentic narrations. b. According to the narration of Yahya al-Mazini: His father, Amr b. Yahya's grandfather, Abdullah b. He said to Zayd, "Can you show us how the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) performed ablution?" Abdullah b. Zayd also said "yes" and asked for water for wudu, then poured the water and washed his hands, then poured water into his mouth and nose and threw three ticks out, then washed his face three times and his hands including the elbows twice, from front to back and from back to front. My head has been anointed with both hands. It's like this: He starts from the front of his head and takes his hands to his neck, and then he brings his hands back to the first starting place. Finally, he washed his feet. tahara 38, 39,41,42,45,46; Muslim, Tahare 18, 19, Tirmidhi, Tahare 24, Nesai, Tahare 79, 80; Ibn Majah, tahara 51; Muvatta, tahara 1. b. Yahya al-Mazini, through his father, Abdullah b. Zayd b. He related the same hadith from Asim (the previous one), but (in addition to Abdullah Ibn Zayd) said: He poured water into his mouth and nose with one hand and repeated it three times." Then Abdullah mentioned the rest of the hadith exactly.. According to this, his father, Vasi', heard Abdullah bin Zayd bin Asim al-Mazini talking about seeing the Messenger of Allah and narrating his ablution. until he washed it." tahara 19; Tirmidhi, Tahfife 36. b. Meysere el-Hadrâmî, el-Mikdâm b. He said, "I heard Ma'di kerib al-Kindi say: A wudu' water was brought to the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) and he performed ablution. (first) he washed his hands three times, then rinsed his mouth and nose three times, and then washed his face and arms three times. Finally, my head wiped the inside and outside of its ears." According to the narration of b. Maysara, Mikdam ibn Ma'dikerib said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) performing ablution. When it came time to wipe his head, he put his hands in front of his head. , then he moved it all the way to the nape of his head. Finally, he pulled his hand back to where he started." He reported that Mahmud Walid, the narrator of the hadith, had narrated the hadith (via sema), saying, "Hariz told me." b. Halid and Hisham b. Khalid narrated the same meaning and said (this hadith) "Al-Walid narrated to us with this deed (and this way) and the Messenger of Allah made models of the inside and outside of his ears." Hisham, on the other hand, added the sentence "He put his fingers in his ear holes" (to this narration). al-Muğîre b. Ferve and Yazid b. Abi Malik said: Muawiya performed wudu as he saw the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) performing wudu to show the Muslims. When it was his turn, he took a handful of water and transferred it to his left hand and poured it into the middle of his head. Finally, the water started to drip or almost dripped. Then he wiped his head from the front to the back and then from the back to the front" Beyhakî, es-Sünenül-kübra , II, 275. According to a narration (coming) with the deed (previously): al-Walid said: Hadrat Muawiya performed ablution three by three (washing his ablution organs), then washed his feet. bint Muavviz bin Afra said: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) used to come to us (from time to time)." (Abdullah bin Muhammad says:) er-Rubayyi' Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) told him; Can you pour me the ablution water? Then he explained how the Rubayyi Rasûlullah performed ablution and said: He washed his hands and face three times and poured a square of water into his mouth and nose. He anointed my head twice, both inside and out. And (finally) he washed my feet three times." Dawud said: This is the meaning of the hadith narrated by Musedded (not the words). Mace, tahara 52; Tirmidhi, Tahare 25. b. Ismail narrated the following (previous) hadith from Ibn Akil through Sufyan. However, Sufyan (previously) Bishr changed some meanings of the hadith. In this narration, Sufyan said: "And the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) poured water into his mouth and nose three times." Tahara 25; Ibn Majah, Tahara 52. bint As reported by Muavviz b. Afra, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) He made ablution next to er-Rubeyy and wiped his head from the top of his hair to the point where his hair fell out, without disturbing the shape of his hair and messing it up. Tahare 25; Ibn Macc Tahare 52; Ahmed b. Hanbal, VI, 359. b. Muhammad b. Akil, er-Rubeyyi' bint Muavviz bint Muavviz bint Afra reported that: I saw the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) performing ablution. " tahara 25; Ibn Mach Tahara 52; Ahmed b. Hanbal VI, 359. According to what is reported: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) wiped his head with the (wet) water left in his hand."

According to the narration from Mûsârrif's father, his grandfather said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) wiping his head up to the back part called "qazfil" once." Museddad said: And he wiped his head from the front to the neck, such that (pull) his hands out from under his ears." Davud said: Müsedded said that; I told this to Yahya and he didn't accept it." Davud said: I was Ahmed b. Hanbal said, "Allegedly, Ibn Uyayna did not accept this hadith either, and Talha said from his father, (hear it) from his grandfather, what kind of deed is this?" I heard you say. b. Hanbel, Ili, 481. b. According to the narration of Jubayr: Ibn Abbas (radiy-Allâhu anh) saw the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) performing wudu three times, and he wiped his ears and head once. Tahare 84; Tirmidhi, Tahare 28; Ibn Mace Tahare 52. Umama (radiy-Allâhu anh) narrated the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) performing ablution and said: from the beginning," he said. Tahara 29, Ibn Mâce, Tahare 53. Ibn Harb said that the sentence "ears are from the head" is Abu Umama's own word (that is, there is no hadith). Qutayba reported that Hammad said about this word about the ears, "I don't know whether this word belongs to the Prophet or to Abu Umama." Müsedded with Sulayman Ibn Harb, this hadith was written by Sinan b. While they said that they were narrating from Rabia (the other sheikh of Abu Dawud), Kutayba said that Sinan Abu Rabia reported this hadith. (Actually, one of these two names is the name of the same person, and the other is his name. To explain this point) Abu Dâvûd says (like this). He (i.e. Sinan) is the son of Rabi'a. His name is Abu Rabia. (In other words, the person meant by these two names is the same person.)

He said and (then) performed ablution (washing) one by one. Bukhari, voodoo' 22, 42; Tirmidhi, tahara 26, 32, 34, 35; Nesai, tahara 64; Ibn Majah Tahara 45, 47; Darîmî salât 29, Ahmed b.

143-) Asim b. Lukît's father, Lakît b. According to what he narrated from Sabre: Lakît came to Hadrat Âisha (radiy-Allâhu anhâ) and conveyed the meaning of the previous hadith. He said (in addition to the previous hadith). "Without (long) waiting, the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) came walking sternly and bravely." Asim said, Ibn Jurayj narrated this (hadith numbered 142) to us (However), he added to his narration (the Prophet) "Give your mouth water when you make ablution" (he said).
160-) Evs b. It is narrated from Ebî Aws es-Sakafi that; The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) performed ablution. He anointed his shoes and feet." The narrator Abbad said, "I saw the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) come to a well of a people, that is, a water tank, and make wudu and wipe over their shoes and feet." Although he said, "I saw sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) going to a water well (that is, a water tank) of a people"; Müsedded did not mention the water tank or the water well. Both of them unanimously recited the next statement "He performed ablution and wiped over his shoes and feet". b. Hanbal IV, 7.

According to what is narrated from Yasir (radiyallahu anh); The Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) allowed a junub person to perform wudu' when he was about to eat, drink or sleep." Friday 78. Dawud said: In the deed of this hadith, Yahya b. Ya'mur and Ammar b. Yasir There is a narrator among them that has not been mentioned." The purpose of making this addition is to point out that the hadith is 'conservative'. Although this is a sign of weakness, the hadiths pointing out that it is mustahab to make wudu reinforce this hadith. b. Abi Talib, Ibn Omar and Abdullah b. Amr; When a person who is junub wants to eat, he makes wudu."
228-) Aisha (radiyallahu anha) said: Although the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was junub, he slept without touching water." Tahara 87; Ahmad b. Hanbal. VI, 146, 171. Dawud said: Hasen b. Ali al-Wasiti informed us and said: Yazid b. I heard Harun say that this hadith (referring to the hadith of Abu Ishaq) is a mistake."
243-) ...Âisha (radiy-Allâhu anhâ) said: When the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) wanted to make a ghusl because of janaba, he would first wash his hands up to his wrists, then his fercine with a spoon and pour water on them. After cleaning his hands, he would rub it against the wall. Then he would start to make wudu (while making wudu) and then pour water on his head." Ahmad bin Hanbal, VI, 102, 227. (radiyallahu anha) said: By Allah, if you want, I can show you the handprint of the Messenger of Allah on the wall where he used to wash because of his janaba. " only Abu Dawud narrated it. Abbas reported that his aunt Maymuna said: I prepared the water for the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) to bathe in because of his janaba. He bent the vessel over his right hand and washed it two or three times (this doubt is from al-A'mash). Then he poured water on his private part and washed it with his left hand. Then he rubbed his (left) hand on the ground and washed it. Then he took water in his mouth and nose, washed his face and hands, poured water on his head and body, stepped aside and washed his feet. gusl 8, 11, 18, 21; Nesai, Gusl 22; Ahmed b. Hanbel, VI, 335. I gave him the towel, but he did not take it, he started to remove the water from his body (by wiping it). (al-A'mash says) I told this to Ibrahim (an-Nahaiy) (that the Messenger of Allah did not take the towel and sprinkled water on it). Ibrahim; they did not see any harm in using a towel, but they would consider it a disgrace to have menstruation.” Davud relates the following statement of Müsedded: I said to Abdullah Ibn Davud, “They used the towel as a disgrace to menstruate” Do you know something? He said yes it is. (In Maymune's narration, there was no phrase that they would consider it a habit to be a custom) but I found this phrase in my book, he said. It has been reported that he said; When Ibn Abbas (radiy-Allâhu anh) wanted to take a bath due to junubism, he would pour water on his left hand with his right hand seven times and then wash his private parts. He forgot how many times he poured water once and said, "How many times have I spilled?" she asked me. Me too; I don't know". Then Ibn Abbas (with amazement) said, "Hey motherless, why don't you know?" Then he would make wudu as he did for prayer, pour water on his body and say, "This is how the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) would be cleansed of junubism." b. Hanbal, I, 307. It was narrated from b. Umar (radiy-Allâhu anh): Prayer was fifty (times), washing because of janabah seven times and washing urine from clothes was seven times. He continued to pray (to Allah) until the time was reduced to one time to wash due to janabah and to one time to wash urine from clothes.” From Hurayra (radiyallahu anh), he said; The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: Under every hair is junub. Wash all the hairs and clean the skin." Tahare 78; Ibn Mâce, Tahare 106. Dâvûd, "Haris b. Wajih himself is weak, his hadith is munkar, he said. "Harith b.

It is narrated from Dinar Hasen as mursel, from Ebânü'l-Attar Qatada, from Hasen and he from Abu Hurayra. If he does not wash such a place and leaves it as junub, he (the person who left the abandoned place or the person who did not wash this place) will be punished for such and such (or for such a period of time). Mâce, Tahare 106. Ahmed b. Hanbal, I, 94, 101, 133.

Awf's wife, Umm Habibe bint Jahsh, was istihada for seven years and asked for a fatwa from the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) in this regard. Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam): This is not menstruation, but a vein (blood). Wash and pray." He said. He washed in a basin in his sister Zaynab bint Jahsh's cell, and the redness of the blood surfaced. Sources of the 285th hadith. Shihab said: Amre bint Abdirrahman told me about this (previous) hadith from Umm Habiba. Aisha (radiy-Allâhu anhâ) said: (Umm Habibe) used to make ghusl for every prayer.” b. Sa'd narrated this hadith from Ibn Shihab and he from Aisha (radiyallahu anha) with the order of Urwa and said, "She (Umm Habiba) used to take a bath for every prayer." Davud reported this hadith from Kasım b. He said that Mabrûr narrated from Yunus, from Ibn Shihab, from Amre, and Amra from Umm Habiba bint Jahsh through Aisha. as Ma'mer, from Zuhri; He also narrated from Aisha with the Tariq of Amre. Sometimes Ma'mer narrated the hadith (as mu'an'an) from Umm Habiba through Amra in this sense. Likewise, Ibrahim b. Sa'd and Ibn Uyeyna narrated from Zuhri, and Amra from Aisha. Ibn Uyayna did not say in his hadith that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) ordered him (Umm Habiba) to take a bath. Evzai also narrated that Âisha (radiy-Allâhu anhâ) said, "She would wash for every prayer". (radiy-Allâhu anhâ), he said; Umm Habiba was istihada for seven years. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) ordered him to wash himself.

After Ishaq said this, he narrated the hadith (Ummu Habiba mentioned at the beginning of the chapter). Dawud said: The hadith of Abu'i-Walid et-Tayalisi -but I did not hear it from him- Sulayman b. It was narrated from Kathir that he said from Urwa with his Zuhri tank, and he from Hadrat Aisha: bint Jahsh became istihaza. The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said to him: "A ghusl for every prayer." He added the hadith (at the beginning of the chapter after Sulayman ibn Kathir had mentioned them). Sulayman ibn Kathir said, "Make wudu for every prayer." But this is Abdussamed's delusion. The truth is that Abu'l-Walid said. Salama (radiyallahu anh) said: Zaynab bint Ebi Salama informed me "There was constant blood coming from the wife of Abdurrahman b. Awf, who was married. The woman was Umm Habib bint Jahsh. The Messenger of Allah ordered her to wash and perform her prayers at every prayer time." b. Abi Kathir says: Abu Salama) informed me that Umm Bakr Aisha said: About the woman who saw something (blood) that made her doubtful after the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was cleansed (her menstrual period ended): is the vein (blood)." someone has doubted whether the pronoun is as a dictator or as a muennes, and whether it is or not. Only Ibn Majah narrated Bekr's narration.

His wife narrated a similar hadith from our mother Hadrat Aisha and he from the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). It is a merfu hadith that came down to the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam). All of the hadiths (reported from A'isha as mawkuf and merfu) are weak, not authentic. This (previous) hadith is evidence of the weakness of the hadith narrated by A'mash from Habib. He denied that Habîb's hadith is merfû by narrating it. from spouse; He also narrated it from Hadrat Âisha as mawkuf. Davud continued, Ibn Dawud narrated the beginning of this hadith as merfû and denied that it is necessary to make wudu in every prayer (existence of the expression).

If the blood is too much, he will tie a cloth to his body." Dârimi replied, "Wudû' 85 (in the bab title). Davud said that it was narrated from Omar and Enes b. Malik that he "washes himself from noon to noon". Davud and Asim, Shabi They have narrated the same thing from Kamîr through his wife from Âsim, and Kamîr from Âisha. However, Dawud added the word "everyday" (in addition to the above). This view is from Salim b. It is the view of Abdillah, Hasen and Ata.

Ziyâd, one of the narrators, stated that it was an invitation to worship by the Jews. The Prophet (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) did not like it either and said, "This is the work of the Jews." (Ravi) said Abu Umayr (or his uncle) That is, although the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) was offered to ring a bell, the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said, "This is a Christian thing."

He taught me," he conveyed his dream. Abu Umayr (or his uncle) said, "However, Umar ibn al-Khattab (radiyallahu anh) saw this dream twenty days ago (but he hid it). The Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) told him, "Why didn't you tell me about this before?" When he commanded, Umar (radiy-Allâhu anh) replied: b. Zayd was ahead of me. I was embarrassed too. Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) said: “O Bilal, get up and look at Abdullah b. Whatever Zayd tells you, memorize it and perform it exactly.” (The narrator) said: Bilal recited the (first) adhan (thus). Narrated by Abu Dawud. Bishr said: According to what Abu Umayr told me, Ansar; If Abdullah b. If Zayd had not been ill that day, the Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) would have made him a muezzin.

While I was sleeping (in my dream), a man came to me with a bell in his hand. I told him: Servant of Allah! Won't you sell me this bell? said. what are you going to do? said. I said we will call (the people) to prayer. Shall I show you something better than this? said. So I said to him: (show me). He said: You say: Allah is the greatest. God is the greatest.

"I testify that he is the messenger of Allah. Come to prayer, come to salvation, Prayer has begun. Prayer has begun. Allah is the greatest. Allah is the greatest. There is no god but Allah." In the morning, I came to the Messenger of Allah and told him what I had seen. He said, "I hope it is a true dream. Get up with Bilal and teach him what you see so that he can sing the adhan. Because his voice is louder and sweeter than yours." We got up together with Bilal. I started teaching Him, and he (started) reading. Abdullah b. Zayd (continuing) said: Omar b. Al-Khattab (radiyallahu anh) went out quickly and said, "O Messenger of Allah, I swear by Allah who sent you as a true Prophet, I saw what he saw." (Thereupon) The Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) said: Praise be to Allah. It is just like the hadith above. However, Ibn Ishaq narrated from Zuhri, "Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest. Allah is the Greatest" (four times) but in the narrations they made from Ma'mer and Yunus Zuhri (twice), they said "Allah is the greatest, Allah is the Greatest". They did not repeat it again. mevâkît 25; İbn Mâce, azan 1; Dârimi , salat 3; Ahmed b. Hanbal, IV, 43.

Allah is the greatest. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah." (Nâfi b. Ömer) İbn Cüreyc's Abdulaziz b. He mentioned the meaning of the hadith he narrated from Abdulmalik and the similarity of the adhan in that event. Dawud said: Malik b. In Dinar's hadith (there is the following narration): I asked Ibn Abi Mahzure to tell me about the adhan that his father received from the Messenger of Allah. He only replied, "Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest". b. Such is the hadith that Sulayman narrated from Ibn Abi Mahzure, and he from his grandfather through his uncle.

However, in Jafar's narration (in excess), there is the expression "Then Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar" (he raised his voice) by repeating.
506-) Amr b. Murre said, "I heard (saying) Ibn Abi Layla": it has undergone three changes. Our masters of the Companions (as-kiram) narrated to us: (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) said, (I am pleased that the prayer of (all) Muslims or believers is one (performed in congregation). I even thought of sending men to announce it. And I even had a heart to order (some) people to stand on the rooftops and announce that it was time for prayer." They were even going to ring the bell (almost for this purpose). (Ibn Abi Layla) says : A man from the Ansar came: The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) came home because I saw you in a state of concern, and when I returned (in my dream) I saw a man wearing two green clothes as if he stood over the mosque and recited the adhan, then sat for a while and stood up (again). He said the following things. However, he was saying (this time as an extra) that the prayer had begun. If it were not for the fear of you saying '" (reported as): The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said; By Allah, Allah has shown you goodness." (This sentence) was narrated by Ibn Musanna. (Other narrator) Amr, on the other hand, did not mention the issue. The Messenger of Allah said, "Teach Bilal and let him sing the adhan." (Again, Ibn Abi Layla) He says: I saw the same as Omar saw, but I was ashamed (to say) because I was late (in informing). As our master Kiram (in) informed us, (previously) when a man came (to the congregation), he would ask (how many rak'ahs of the prayer were performed with the imam) and he was informed that he was late for the prayer (how many rak'ahs). (Some of the congregation praying with the Messenger of Allah (some) would be standing, (some) would be in ruku, (some) would be sitting, and (some) would be in the same state as the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam). he said; Amr said, "He narrated it to me (this narration) from Husayn Ibn Abi Layla". (Then one day) Muadh (the congregation) came and (-Shu'be says, I heard this from Husayn-) Muaz said, "In what state do I see the Messenger of Allah (in prayer)- (starting with)" He narrated the words of the Messenger of Allah, which continued until he said, "Do the same." Dawud said: Then Amr b. Going back to the Marzuk hadith (in this narration) Ibn Abi Layla says: The day) Muadh (the congregation) came, -how many rak'ahs of prayer had been performed in congregation before- they pointed to him. (Shu'be says that I heard this from Husayn.) (Continuing the narration of Ibn Abi Layla) said: Muâz (radiy-Allâhu anh); No matter what state I see him (the Messenger of Allah) in, I will follow him." According to what he narrated to us: When the Messenger of Allah came to Madinah, he ordered the Muslims to fast for three days (every month). Then the verse of Ramadan (the verse about fasting) was sent down. They (Muslims from Medina) were not accustomed to fasting, it was very difficult for them to fast. (Therefore) a person who could not fast was feeding a poor person (for the day he could not fast). Then, when the 185th verse of al-Baqara (2) was revealed, "Whoever among you believers is present in this (blessed) month (or witnesses this blessed month) should fast in it", the fasting license is only valid for the guests and the sick. it happened. They (other than this) were commanded to fast. Abi Layla says; (Some) of our Companions (radiy-Allâhu anh) narrated to us that; (in the beginning) if a person reached the time of iftar and fell asleep before eating, he would not be able to eat again, he used to fast in the morning. A Companion said: 'Umar (radiyallahu anh) came (to the house) and asked his wife (to come to his bed). Room; I slept (without eating), he said. Omar, thinking that his wife was making excuses, approached him. (And) a man from the Ansar came (to his house) (at the time of iftar) and wanted to eat (his household) said, "(wait) until he warms something for you", so he fell asleep (without eating). Thereupon, the following verse was revealed to the Messenger of Allah: It is permissible for you to approach your women on the night of fasting." al-Baqara, 187.
507-) Muâz b. It is narrated from Cebel (radiyallahu anh) that; Prayer and fasting were changed three times. Nasr (b. al-Muhajir about these changes) narrated the entire hadith. Ibn al-Musenna reported only the part (about Muslims) praying towards Bayt al-Maqdis (of this hadith). (Ibnu'l-Musenna) says; The third state (related to the change of prayer) is that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) came to Madinah and prayed towards Bayt al-Maqdis for thirteen months. Then Allah sent down the following verse: We see that your face is being searched in the sky. Now (be of good cheer) We will turn you to a qibla that you will be pleased with. Come on, turn your face towards Masjid al-Haram. Wherever you (O believers) are, turn your face towards it." (2), with the 144th verse) Allah directed His Messenger to the Ka'ba. (Ibnu'l-Musenna's) The hadith ended (here). I testify that there is no god but Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah. I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Twice: Let's pray, twice: Come to salvation. Allah is the greatest. Allah is the greatest. There is no god but Allah." Then he paused a little and stood up, saying the same words (again). (Abdullah bin Zayd) says: However, after (the person I saw in my dream this time) said, "Come to salvation," the prayer began, and he added (his words). (Muâz) says: Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) (addressing Abdullah); Teach this to Bilal." Bilal also recited the adhan with these words. Nasr (in the narration of b. al-Muhajir) also said the following about fasting: (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) used to fast on three days of each month and once on the day of Ashura. Then Allahu Teala: Fasting has been written on you. As a matter of fact, it has been written for those before you as well" (the verse of the Qur'an) "The satisfaction of the sluggish ransom" al-Baqara (2), 184. (words). Now, those who wanted to fast were fasting, and those who wanted to fast were feeding a poor person every day. This feeding was a substitute for fasting, this is a change (in fasting). Then Allah azza wa jalla revealed the verse: The month of Ramadan, in which the Qur'an was sent down in the form of proofs of truth and proof of guidance. Fasting has become obligatory for everyone who reaches this month. (Then) Sirma ibn Qays came to his house (having worked all day)..." and (Nasr, this is what Nasr says about the periods of fasting). ) narrated the hadith (to the end).

He replied, "This is when the imam reads it aloud." In the narration of Ibn Kathir, Shu'ba said to Qatada; He knew that the Prophet (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) said, "It looks like he saw this as ugly," and he replied, "If he had seen it ugly, he would have avoided it." salat 47 - 49; Nesai, iftitah 27; kıyâmu'l-leyl 50; Ahmed b.

David, salal 115 - 116; Tirmidhi, Mevâkît 110; Nesai, Sehv 29; Dânmi, salat 92; Ahmed b. Hanbal, IV, 227; V, 424.
965-) Muhammed b. Amr b. Halhala, this previous hadith is from Muhammad b. Amr b. It was narrated from Ata: "He was sitting with a group of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh)..." He did not mention Abu Qatada. (In the narration of Muhammad) he also said: When he (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) sat (after the first two rak'ahs), he would sit on his left foot, and when he sat in the last rak'ah, he would put his left foot forward and sit on his hip.
966-) Muhammed b. It was narrated from Amr al-Amiri that he said: "I was in a council..." and narrated this (previous) hadith: When he sat (after) two rak'ahs, he would sit on the sole of his left foot and plant his right foot. when it was done, he would put his left rough on the ground and take his feet off from one side.
967-) Abbas -or Ayyaş- b. According to what is reported from Sahl es-Saidi; he was in an assembly where his father was also present... he mentioned in the hadith that (Abu Humayd) said: - The word denotes the state of prostration while the Prophet was sitting. The word "sitting" should actually mean "prostrating", as in hadith no. 733. Because sitting has nothing to do with prostration. He prostrated, leaning on his palms, knees, and forefoot. Then he sat on his left rough and planted the other (right) foot. Then he said takbir and prostrated. Then he recited takbir again and stood up, but this time he stood up without sitting on his hips and performed the other rak'ah. He uttered takbir just like he did in the first rak'ah and sat down after two rak'ahs. When he wanted to stand up (after this first tashahhud), he stood up by saying takbir. Then he performed the other (last) two rak'ahs and saluted to his right and left. David said: In the hadith (Isa b. Abdillah); He did not say what Abdulhamid had said about raising hands while getting up from tawarruk and the second rak'ah. David, salat 117.
968-) Abbas b. It is narrated from Sahl: Abu Humayd, Abu Usayd, Sahl b. Sa'd and Muhammed b. They met in Salem.

969-) Abdullah b. It is narrated from Mas'ud (radiy-Allâhu anh): - When we sat together with the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) in prayer, we used to say, "Peace be to Allah before His servants, peace be upon him (from the angels) and so on." The Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: Do not say, "Peace be to Allah". Because God himself is peace. But those of you who sit on the qa'da; all kinds of tahiyya, all worship and good words are only for Allah. All kinds of greetings, Allah's mercy and all goodness be upon you, O Prophet, and peace be upon us and Allah's righteous servants." -(Peace be upon the righteous servants, referring to his word) "Whoever among you says this, or - By Shekk Musedded. - It has hit every righteous servant between the earth and the sky. He continued: Then he should choose any prayer he likes and pray with it. azan 48, 150, isti'zan 3, 28, deavat, VI, tawhid 5; Muslim, salat 56, 60, 62; Nesai, application 100, sahv 56, 43, 41; Ibn Majah, ikamet 34; prayer 10; Tirmidhi, salat 100, Deavât 82; Darimi, salat 84; Muvatta' nida 53, 55; Ahmed b.

970-) Abdullah (b. Mas'ud)'dah; He said: When we sat in prayer, we did not know what to say. The Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) was also taught (which we did not know). Temîm b. After that, al-Muntasir explained the previous hadith in meaning. Sharik in his narrators received this hadith in two different ways. This part of the hadith is written by Abu Ishaq, Abu'l-Ahvas and Abdullah b. It is a narration based on the Mas'ud deed. This section; It was also narrated by Nesai, Ibn Majah and Tirmidhi.
971-) Sharik, on the other hand, narrated the previous hadith exactly by Jami - that is, Ibn Shaddad - Abu Vail and Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) and said: (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) was teaching us some words. But he did not teach them (with care) as he taught tashahhud. These words are: O Allah, unite our hearts. Fix things between us and show us the ways of salvation. Take us out of the darkness (of disbelief) into the light (of Islam) and away from the visible and invisible of major sins. Give us abundant good in our ears, eyes, hearts, spouses and children. Accept our repentance too. Because you accept repentance, you are merciful. "Make us one of those who are grateful for your blessings, who confess them, and who are satisfied! And complete your blessings for us!" Narrated by Abu Dawud.
972-) Abdullah b. According to what is reported from Mas'ud, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) held Abdullah's hand and taught tashahhud (to be recited) in prayer. He recited the same prayer in the hadith of the narrator A'mash. (In addition to the aforementioned hadith of Â'mash, the Messenger of Allah or Ibn Mas'ud said: The one you say this (tashahhud) -or the skepticism- belongs to one of the narrators. When you have completed- (it means) you have completed your prayer. (From now on) get up if you want, sit down if you want. Sunen, I, 379; Beyhakî, es-Sünü'l-Kübrâ, II, 175.
973-) Ibn Umar (radiy-Allâhu anh) narrated from the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) about tashahhud: All kinds of tashahhud, all kinds of worship, good words belong only to Allah. Salam, may Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you, O Prophet!" said Ibn Umar; I added the word "Blessings of Allah" to Tashahhud. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah." Umar said, "I added the word (he is one, he has no partner) to him." I also testify that Muhammad is His servant and messenger." Sunen, I, 353.
974-) Hıttân b. It is narrated from Abdullah er-Rekashi: Abu Musa al-Ash'ari led us in prayer. When he sat down at the end of the prayer, one of the congregation said: Prayer (in the Qur'an) is combined with all kinds of charity and zakat. The meaning we give to the sentence is in accordance with Nihâye's explanation. It is also possible that the word here means cleaning. According to this, the meaning of the sentence should be as follows: Prayer has been established as a good and cleansing prayer. When Moses finished the prayer, he turned to the congregation and said, "Which of you said those words before?" No one answered. Abu Musa said again: Which of you said the words? Again, no sound came from the congregation. This time, Abu Musa said to me: Hıttan, I guess you said it. I didn't say it. I was afraid of your rebuke anyway. I said, "I told Abu Musa (turned), but I didn't wish for anything but good," said a man. Abu Musa: Don't you know what to say? (Such conversations invalidate your prayers.) No doubt, the Messenger of Allah addressed us, explained our way (in religion), taught us our prayer, and in this sermon our master said: When you stand up for prayer, first straighten your ranks. Then let one of you become an imam. Say "Amen" when you read the verse: "Not from those who have suffered wrath or those who are astray." Allah accepts your prayer. Say takbir and bow, no doubt the imam will bow before you and stand up before you. If you dive after the imam in ruku', it is equivalent to staying after him in straightening. When the imam says = Allah heard those who praised him), you say = = Our Lord, all praise is due to you). God hears you. Because Allah (azza wa jalla) said in the language of his Prophet, "Allah heard the one who praised Him". (He taught this in the language of his Prophet). When the imam utters takbir and prostrates, you also say takbir and prostrate. Undoubtedly, the imam prostrates before you and raises his head before you. Your prostration after the imam is equivalent to raising your head after him. When the person performing the prayer sits down, his first word is: All good deeds, all worship and good words are for Allah. O Prophet, peace be upon you, and Allah's mercy and blessings upon you. Peace be upon us and the righteous servants of Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is Allah's servant and Messenger." salat 62; masâjid 149; fedail 137, Nesai, imame 38; ifitah, 19; Dârimî, salât 92, Ahmed b.

He says that these words are actually meant for each other, but the references between them are for abbreviation. The translation was made by taking these words of Nevevi into consideration. May Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you, O Prophet! Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah. Again, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." salah 60. Tirmidhi, salat 100; Nesai 103; İbn Mâce, ikâme, 24; Ahmed b. Hanbal, I, 292.

Dawud said: Zubayr ibn Adi reported this hadith from Ibn Abi Layla like Mis'ar, but he also said: You are praised as you glorify Abraham's progeny. You are the owner of glory and honor. Give Muhammad a lot of good-" Zubayr encouraged the hadith similar to Mis'ar.

Then, when the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) stood up (for the second rak'ah), they too (the other) prostrated themselves. Then, both groups gathered together with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and continued to pray. They went into ruku' and prostration together with the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam). Then, when the Messenger of Allah returned and reached the second prostration, they made the most of the prostration with him, trying not to be mistaken in haste.

Then he would get up and do one more rak'ah. He would not sit outside the eighth and ninth rak'ahs and would only greet in the ninth rak'ah.

As mentioned briefly in the explanation of the hadith numbered 1463-), it is permissible according to the majority of the people to favor one part of the Qur'an over the other. Nawawi relates the following from Qadi Iyaz: This hadith is proof that it is permissible to favor one part of the Qur'an over another. Likewise, it is permissible for Allah's books to be superior to one another. However, the issue is controversial among scholars. Abu'l-Hasen al-Ashari, Abu Bakr Bakillani, a group of jurists and scholars do not consider it permissible for the verses of the Qur'an to be superior to each other. For, according to them, seeing some parts of the Qur'an as superior necessitates the deficiencies of the others, which cannot be found in the word of Allah. They interpreted the expressions indicating the superiority of some verses and suras in the hadiths as greatness and virtue. Teftezani says in Akaid: As it is written in the hadith, it is permissible for some suras to be more virtuous. The truth of superiority is that it is best to recite it because the remembrance of Allah is abundant and it is more beneficial to the reciter. The reading and writing of other books and their provisions are abrogated by the Qur'an."

Whichever Muslim is asked for zakat accordingly, he should give it; whoever is asked for more than ten should not give it. Less than five camels (as zakat) are given. One sheep is given for every five camels. When the number of camels reaches twenty-five, a female camel that has completed one year of age and has reached the age of two is given until it reaches thirty-five. If there are no female camels that have completed one year and reached the age of two, a male camel that has completed two years of age and has turned three is given. When he reaches the age of forty-five, a female camel that has completed the age of two and has reached the age of three is given. When it reaches six, up to sixty male camels are drawn, and a female camel that has completed the age of three and reached the age of four is given. When it reaches the age of seventy-five, a female camel that has completed the age of four and has reached the age of five is given. When they reach the age of six, two female camels that have completed the age of two and turned three until ninety are given. When it reaches one, up to one hundred and twenty male camels are drawn, and two female camels that have completed the age of three and turned four are given. When it is more than twenty, a female camel that has completed the age of two and has reached the age of three is given to every forty camel, and a female camel that has completed the age of three and has reached the age of four is given to every fifty camels. If the zakat of the camels with him reaches a female camel who has completed the age of four and has reached the age of five, and if she does not have a camel of this age with her, but a female camel that has completed the age of three and has reached the age of four, this camel is accepted (as zakat) from that (owner) of the property. And if he has one (to make up for the age difference), he gives two sheep twenty dirhams (silver) with him. If the zakat (camel) with him reaches a female camel who has completed the age of three and has reached the age of four; The zakat officer gives him either twenty dirhams (silver) or two sheep. If the zakat (of their camels) reaches a female camel who has completed the age of three and has reached the age of four, and if there is no such camel with her, but a female camel that has completed the age of two and has reached the age of three is found, that (camel) is accepted from her. David said, "From here on, I could not capture the hadith as I wished from Moses." And he also gives two sheep or twenty dirhams (silver) if he has it with him. If there is a female camel that has reached the age of four, it will be accepted as a camel. Davud said, "I couldn't capture this hadith well up to this point, but I captured the rest well. "And the zakat officer gives him twenty dirhams (silver) or two sheep. If the zakat (of his camels) reaches a female camel who has completed the age of two and has reached the age of three, and she has only one she-camel that has completed one year of age and has reached the age of two, she has two camels with that camel. Sheep or twenty dirhams are accepted. If the zakat of the (camels) with him reaches a female camel who has completed one year of age and has reached the age of two, and if she has only a male camel who has completed the age of two and has reached the age of three, that (camel) will be accepted. If he has only four camels with him, there is no zakat on them. However, if the owner wishes (he can give it). When it is more than three hundred and one, there is one sheep (zakah) for every hundred sheep. Neither old nor defective cattle nor offspring (such as rams and goats) are taken in zakat. However, if the zakat officer wishes, he can take them. Mufterik (separate property) is not brought together for fear of loss or decrease. Collective goods (goods) are also not differentiated. The two of them settle accounts according to their shares regarding the zakat taken from the Khalid's (common) property. If their sheep fed on pastures do not reach forty, they have nothing (as zakat). But if the owner wishes, he can give it. There is one zakat in forty. If silver is only one hundred and ninety (dirhams), there is no zakat on it. But the owner can give it if he wants. zakat 38; Nasai, zakat 5, 10; Ibn Majah, zakat 10; Ahmed b. Hanbal, I, 11.
1570-) Salim narrated that his father said: (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) had the letter of zakat dictated, and left it with his sword, not giving it to the zakat officers until he passed away. Abu Bakr acted with him until he passed away. Then Umar acted with him until he passed away. That letter contained: One sheep for five camels; There are two sheep in ten camels, three sheep in fifteen camels, and four sheep (zakat) in twenty.

If the camels are more than that, every fifty (camel) has a female camel that has completed the age of three and has reached the age of four, and every forty-two year old female camel (zakat) has reached the age of three. One sheep up to one hundred and twenty from forty sheep, two sheep up to two hundred when one hundred and twenty more, and three sheep (zakat) up to three hundred if there is one more than two hundred. If the cattle are more than that, there is one sheep (zakat) for every hundred sheep. There is no zakat unless it reaches the face. For fear of (increase or decrease), the collective (property) cannot be separated, and the separate cannot be brought together. The two of them settle accounts according to their shares regarding the zakat taken from the Khalid's (common) property. neither old nor defective (animals) are taken." Zakat 4; Ibn Majah, Zakat 9; Ahmed b. Hanbal, 11-15; V-216; b. Huseyn said: When the zakat officer arrives, the sheep are divided into three parts: One third is bad. (halli), one third good (halli) and one third moderate (halli). The zakat officer takes it from the middle class" and did not mention the cattle.
1571-) Muhammed b. Yazid al-Wasiti said; b. Hüseyn conveyed the same meaning to us with the same deed; If there is no female camel that has completed the age of one and has reached the age of two, a male camel that has completed the age of two and has reached the age of three is given (given).
1572-) Yunus b. Yazid Ibn Shihâb (az-Zuhri) narrates that he said: It is a copy of the letter that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) had dictated about zakat, (his original) was Umar b. He is with the Khattab family. Ibn Shihab (continuing) told me that Salim b. Abdullah b. I have memorized all of them just as Ömer had them read. He was Umar b. Abdulaziz's Abdullah b. Abdullah b. Umar and Salim b. Abdullah b. It is the copy that he ordered from Umar to be transmitted, he said, and he narrated the hadith (continuing): When the camels reach one hundred and twenty-nine, they have three female camels (zakat) who have completed the age of two and have reached the age of three. At the age of one hundred thirty, there are two female camels that have completed the age of two until they reach the age of thirty-nine, and a she-camel (zakat) that has completed the age of three and has reached the age of four. At the age of one hundred and forty, there are two female camels who have completed the age of three and reached the age of four until they reach the age of one hundred and forty-nine, and a female camel (zakat) who has completed the age of two and turned three years old. When he is one hundred and fifty, he has three female camels (zakat) who have completed the age of three and reached the age of four, up to one hundred and fifty nine. At the age of one hundred and sixty, there are four female camels (zakat) until they reach the age of one hundred and sixty-nine. At the age of one hundred and seventy, there are three female camels that have completed the age of two until they reach the age of seventy-nine, and a she-camel (zakat) that has completed the age of three and reached the age of four.

When there are two hundred, there are four female camels who have completed the age of three and turned four, or five female camels (zakat) who have completed the age of two and turned three. (O zakat officer) whichever of these two things you find, you will receive. He said, "Yunus ibn Yazid" narrated a hadith similar to the hadith of Sufyan ibn Husayn. He had this: In zakat, neither old nor defective, nor offspring (like rams and goats) can be taken. However, if the zakat officer wishes, he can take it.
1573-) Malik said: Umar b. Hattab's; The meaning of the saying, "The one that is separate (property) is not gathered together, but the one that is collective does not separate" means: When the coming of the zakat officer approaches, they gather them together so that they have only one sheep (zakat wajib). meaning) when each of the two khalids has one hundred and one sheep, they will have three sheep (zakat wajib) on top of the two.

(Seeing me in this state) one said to the other, (the man) is not more understanding than his camel. (Hearing this) I thought that the mountain had collapsed on me.

So I came to a man from my people. (I explained my situation. Me); Combine the two of them and make a sacrifice (of the kind) that is easy for you." He said, "I went into ihram for both of them. Thereupon, Umar (radiy-Allâhu anh) replied to me, "You followed his sunnah." menâsik 49; İbn Mâce, menâsık 38; Ahmed b. Hanbal, I, 14, 25, 34, 37, 53.

The people, together with the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam), made (combining) umrah and pilgrimage (combining) dividend(s). Some of the people received and sent the hedy sacrifice, and some did not. When Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) arrived in Makkah, he said to the people; Whoever among you has brought a gift, he cannot make lawful anything that is haram for him until he performs the pilgrimage. Whoever among you did not bring a gift, should circumambulate the Bayt, Safa and Mene immediately and get out of ihram by shortening his hair! Then bring the talbiyah for the pilgrimage and sacrifice! (Anyone who could not find a hedy sacrifice) should fast for three days during the pilgrimage, and for seven days when his family returns to him." (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) when he arrived in Mecca, he performed circumambulation and the first thing he did was to greet the bow. He walked with a mean walk. Finally, when he finished circumambulating the Bayt (belonging to Hazrat Ibrahim), he performed two rak'ahs of prayer next to the maqam. Then he left the prayer by saluting and went to Safa and performed seven tawafs between Safa and Marwa. He did not make lawful to him anything that was forbidden to him (because he was in ihram). Those who took gifts did the same as the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) did: Hajj 104; Nesai, Menâsik 50; Muslim, Hajj 174.
1808-) According to what is reported from Hafsa (radiy-Allâhu anhâ), the wife of the Prophet (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam), she herself (in the Farewell Hajj), the Messenger of Allah, what is the matter with these people that they left the ihram (for Umrah) even though you did not leave it? said. The Messenger of Allah said; I felt my head, I marked my victim. Therefore, they said, "I cannot leave the ihram until I slaughter the sacrifice." Hajj 126, libâs 69; Muslim, Hajj 176; Nesai, Menâsik 40; İbn Mâce, Menâsik 72; Ahmed b. Hanbal VI, 125.
1809-) Selim b. According to what is reported from Aswad, Abu Zer (radiyallahu anh); He said about the person(s) who intend to perform the Hajj and then transfer his Hajj to Umrah, this (license) is only for those who are with the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) during the Farewell Hajj. Mâce, menâsik 42.

1810-) hadith-i sharîf. According to Beyhâkî's statement, Muslim b. Hajjaj said the following about this hadith: Ben Ahmed b. I heard Hanbal saying: I have not seen a better hadith than this, indicating that it is fard." Because the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) told a son whose father was incapable of performing hajj and umrah that he could perform hajj in his father's place. When it is not fard for a person to perform hajj and umrah in place of his father, there is ijma. From what we have said, it is understood that Umrah is not fard but sunnah. Because "the rebellious person is dhimmet." art. 8. Therefore, unless there is clear evidence that the person is responsible for a job, it cannot be ruled that he is responsible for that job. Therefore, it cannot be ruled that a person is obliged to perform Hajj or Umrah on behalf of his father, since there is no evidence about him. In addition, the evidence put forward by those who claim that umrah is fard; One day, while we were sitting next to the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam), a man came and asked: Muhammad, what is Islam? The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) asked, "It is to testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and to perform Hajj and Umrah in the Bayt." The hadith in the sense of 350 cannot be cited as evidence on this issue, because this hadith is contrary to the sound hadiths that express that umrah is not fard, and there is no word "to perform umrah" in the stronger narrations of this hadith. The hadith in the meaning of Sunan, II, 284. is weak because there is Ismail b. Musa al-Makki in its deed. As narrated by b. Abi Rebah from Jabir b. Abdillah, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said, "Hajj and umrah are fard." The hadith in the meaning of es-Sünü'l-kübrâ, IV, 350, is weak and far from being an evidence, since Ibn Lehia is in its booklet.
1811-) Abdullah b. It is narrated from Abbas (radiyallahu anh): Fadl b. Abbas was in the abandonment of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam). A woman from the Has'am Tribe came to the Prophet (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) to ask for a fatwa. Then Fadl began to look at the woman, and the woman at Fadl. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) started to turn Fadl's face to the other side. Woman: Messenger of Allah! Allah's obligation to His servants about pilgrimage came to my father when he was a pir-i mortal. My father cannot stand on a camel. Therefore, can I perform pilgrimage on his behalf? said.

Because you took them by the trust of Allah (in return for the promise you made to Allah) and made them lawful for yourselves with the word of Allah. It is your right on them not to let anyone you dislike set foot in your home. If they do, beat them as long as they don't hurt them. Their right over you is that you give them their food and clothing properly. I have left you something that if you hold fast to it, you will never go astray again: the book of Allah. You will be asked about me, what will you say?

Would you allow Ebi Vakkas to join you? said. (Hazrat-i Omar too); He replied, "Yes", and he allowed them (to enter him). Yes," he said (and allowed them to enter him), and they entered. After a while, Hazrat Abbas (he spoke and said); He said, "O leader of the believers, judge between me and this Ali." One of those present said, "Yes, O commander of the believers, judge between them and be merciful to both of them." Malik b. Evs (continuing his words) said: It seems to me that this community (consisting of Hazrat Abbas and Ali, Hazrat Osman and Hazrat Abdurrahman, ez-Zubayr and Sa'd) is for a job (intercessionist). they had sent ahead. Hazrat Umar said do not rush. Then he returned to that community; For God's sake, I ask you, for the sake of Allah, where the sky and the earth stand by His permission, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said, "We do not leave an inheritance, it is charity that we leave behind." They said, "Yes." Then he turned to Hadrat Ali and Abbas and said, "For Allah's sake, where the heavens and the earth stand by their permission (tell me), do you know that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said, "We do not leave any inheritance. What we leave behind (wealth) is charity". ?" said (they too); They replied, "Yes." He said, "After this, Hadrat Umar said: No doubt, Allah assigned His Messenger with a specialty that he did not give to anyone, and he said (in the Qur'an): As for the spoils that Allah gave to His Prophet, You rode neither a horse nor a camel over him (to obtain it), but Allah sends His Messengers over whom He wills (overtakes them) and Allah has power over all things." Hashr (59) 6. He gave the sons of Nadir (properties) to his Messenger as fay. I swear by Allah: He (the Prophet) did not choose (himself) over you (in the distribution of these properties). He did not take them and refuse to give them to you. The Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) would receive a year's alimony -or his alimony, or his family's alimony- for a year from these properties (which were seized as fey from the sons of Nadir). (Hesitation in this statement belongs to the narrator.) He would put the rest among the goods (in the treasury). Then (Hazrat Umar) turned to this community and said: I ask you for the sake of Allah, where the sky and the earth stand by permission. Do you know this?” He said (They also said): Yes. Then, he turned to Hadrat Abbas and Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) and said: “For God's sake, I am asking you, for the sake of Allah, where the heavens and the earth stand by their own permission, do you know this?” They replied, “Yes.” He continued.) When the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) died, Abu Bakr (radiy-Allâhu anh) said: “I am the caliph of the Messenger of Allah. (Hazrat Umar continued his speech as follows.) Thereupon, you (O Abbas) went to Abu Bakr with this one (standing in front of me) Ali and asked for the inheritance of your brother's son (that is, the inheritance from the Prophet). And this one wanted the inheritance of his wife (Fatimah) from his father (property of the Prophet Muhammad). Hadrat Abu Bakr (radiy-Allâhu anh) replied to you as follows: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh); We do not leave a legacy. What we leave behind is charity." Allah knows. Abu Bakr is truthful. He is a true follower of Allah's orders. He is on the right path and follows the truth. When Abu Bakr passed away, I said, "I am the caliph of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) and Abu Bakr," and he became the trustee of these properties until Allah wished me to be the trustee. Then you and this one (Ali) came together (to me) and demanded these goods from me, even though you both had the same business. I said (to you) that if you want me to give these properties to you, (I can give them to you) on condition that you promise Allah that you will spend them for the places that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) spent. You bought this property from me under these conditions. Then you came to me (again) that I might judge between you other than that. I swear by Allah: I will not make any other judgment between you until the Day of Judgment, if you are helpless in fulfilling these conditions. Give them back to me. David says: (Hazrat Abbas and Hadrat Ali, Hadrat 'Umar) asked him to divide those properties in half between the two of them (and to be given the right of administration and savings). Otherwise, they did not know that the Prophet (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) said, "We do not leave an inheritance. What we leave is charity." They wanted nothing but what was right. As a matter of fact, Hazrat Umar pointed to this situation by saying, "I will not let this property be named as taksim" (I will leave it as it is). humus I, fatil-i ashabunnebiyy 12, megazi 14, 38, nafakat 3, feraiz 3, i'tisam 5; Muslim, jihad 49, 52, 54, 56; Tirmidhi, Siyer 44; Nesai, fey' 9, 16; Muvatta', kalam 27; Ahmed b.

2967-) It was narrated from Hadrat Umar that his property was one of the spoils given to the Messenger of Allah by the Muslims without riding horses or camels on them, and (these goods) belonged only to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). (The Prophet (PBUH) used these goods) for the livelihood of his household. Ibn Abde (sheikh of Musannif Abu Dawud) narrated that "he used to spend the annual sustenance of his family". He would spend the rest for the supply of horses (necessary for war) and in the way of Allah (for the sake of the war to be fought). Ibn Abde narrated (this last sentence) as "(he used to spend) for the sake of horse and weapon (supply)". Jihad 80, Muslim Jihad 48, Nesâî Fey' 8, Ahmed b. Hanbal 1-25, 48.
2968-) From Zuhri, Omar (radiyallahu anh) said: (jalla celaluhu): You did not ride horses and camels for the spoils that Allah gave to his prophet from their property..." (Hashr, 59/6). Zuhri: He said that Hazrat Umar (radiyallahu anh) said: These are the villages of Urayne, Fedek and this council that belong only to the Messenger of Allah. The following is stated in the Quran): The spoils that Allah gave to his prophet from the property of the people of the conquered countries are for Allah, the prophet, his relatives, orphans, the poor and the wayfarer..." (Hashr, 59/7) These booty goods given by Allah are It is for the poor" (Hashr, 59/8) Those who previously settled in Medina and placed faith in their hearts..." (Hashr, 59/9) And those who follow them..." (Hashr, 59/10) (Hazrat-i Umar later said: This verse covered all people. The right of the Muslims in the booty - Ayyub; He said his share - there is no one left but some slaves that you have owned."
2969-) Malik b. Evs b. It was narrated from al-Hadesan: Hadrat Umar (radiy-Allâhu anh) used to say (as follows) while proving his view (that income from fay) belongs to the Prophet and cannot be given to others. "The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) had three stages. When he came to the lands of Nadir (the lands), the Khaybar (part of his land) and the Fadak (half of his land), they were (in their own hands) for the needs of the Prophet. Fadak was being held for passengers (on the way). He used to give the remainder of the share he allocated to the poor of the immigrants.
2970-) Urve b. It was narrated from Zubayr that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam), said to him: Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) Abu Bakr - no doubt, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: We do not leave any inheritance. What we leave is charity. The family members of Muhammad can only eat from this property.” I swear by Allah, I cannot change anything from the charity of the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) from what he was in his time. I will do what the Messenger of Allah did with regard to property.
2971-) Urve b. Zubayr said that this (previous) hadith was told to him by Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam), and said (continuing the narration of Zuhri: Fatima (radiy-Allâhu anh) was then He asked for the remaining (properties) of one-fifth of Khaybar with his alms in Madina and Fedek (which he had left behind). Hadrat Aisha (continuing her words) said - Abu Bakr said to her - The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: We do not leave any inheritance. What we leave is charity. The family of Muhammad said, "They do not have the right to increase their food and clothing expenses any more if they eat only this property, that is, the property that Allah has given them."
2972-) Ibn Shihab said: Urwa said that (previous) hadith was told by Hadrat Aisha. (Urwa) said in this narration: Abu Bakr did not accept this offer of Fatima and; I am not going to abandon an application that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) did. I will definitely fulfill it, I fear that if I abandon a job he has done in this matter, I will go astray from the right path." Then, Hadrat Ali took him from Abbas. When he came to Khaybar (his lands) and Fadak (your land), Hadrat Omar said, "These are alms(s) that will be spent on the important needs of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam). He held it in his hand, saying. "Their administration belongs to the person who will take over the administration." said. That's how they've been (handled) up until now.
2973-) It is narrated that Zuhri (as is) said about the 6th verse of "You rode neither a horse nor a camel on him (to get him)..." (59): The Prophet (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) He made peace with Fedek and the people of (some) villages. (Ma'mer says: -my sheikh Zuhri told the names of these villages) but I could not remember them.- (at that time) Prophet Muhammad surrounded another tribe. This tribe, who was under the Prophet, made a peace offer by sending news from the Prophet. (Because Allah Almighty cast fear into their hearts. The Messenger of Allah accepted their offer. Thereupon, in a verse that Almighty Allah sent down, he said: You (to obtain it) neither throw nor throw on it. You rode camels" (59) 6. (With this word of Almighty Allah, He wants to express that these goods were seized) without war. Zuhri said: (These) properties of the sons of Nadir (uncovered) belonged only to the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam). (Because the Muslims) did not seize them by force, (on the contrary) they captured them peacefully. Therefore, the Prophet (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) divided them among the Muhajirs. Except for two people in need, he did not give anything to the Ansar.
2974-) He said from Mughira: Omar b. When Abdulaziz was elected as the Caliph, he gathered the sons of Marwan (the lands that were the property of the Prophet (PBUH) in their hands) and said (as follows): There is no doubt that the Fadek (land) belonged to the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam). He used to spend some of it (his own family). Some of me used to bestow on the younger sons of Hashim. Some of them married singles. (His daughter) Fatima asked him to give the Fadak land to her, but she did not accept (his request). This was the state of (the land of Fadek) in the life of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam). Finally, when he died and Hazrat Abu Bakr was chosen as the caliph, he did (the same thing) as the Prophet did in the land of Fadak until his death. When Umar was chosen as the caliph, he did the same thing that the Prophet (PBUH) and Abu Bakr did about the Fadak land throughout his life. Then (my grandfather) Marwan allocated him to his relatives through iqta. Finally (the administration of the Fedek land or the caliphate, I) Ömer b. passed to Abdulaziz. Namely, (passed) to Abdulaziz's son. I also saw myself in a job that the Prophet (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) forbade even Hadrat Fatima. Abu Dawud says: -When Omar b. Abdulaziz became the caliph, his income was forty thousand dinars. When he died, it was four hundred dinars.
2975-) It was narrated from Abu Tufayl: (radiy-Allâhu anh) went to Abu Bakr (radiy-Allâhu anh) and asked the Prophet (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) for his inheritance. Abu Bakr (radiyallahu anh) replied: The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said, "Verily, when Allah, the Exalted and Exalted, gave a Prophet any means of livelihood, that source was the person who succeeded him after the death of the Prophet. It is possible." I heard you say.
2976-) It was narrated from Abu Hurayra: The Prophet (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) said: My heirs (which I will leave) cannot divide even a dinar. Whatever I have left apart from the maintenance of my wives and the expenses of my caliph is charity. David said: "Mu'nati amili" (by his word) it is meant to say those who plow (mi) the land. vesaya 32, humus 3, feraiz 3; Muvatta, kelain 28 Ahmed b. Hanbal II-249, 376, 463, 464 .
2977-) He said from Abu Bukhteri: I heard a hadith from someone and I liked it very much. So I said to him, "Let me write this hadith." He brought this hadith (to me) in a clearly written form. (The hadith was like this, one day) "Abbas and Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) went to Hadrat Umar. (Tallha and Zubayr, Abdurrahman and Sa'd were with him. Abbas and Ali were the plaintiffs (from each other). Then, Umar (radiyallahu anh) told Talha, Zubayr, Abdurrahman and Sa'd: Do you know that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said, "All the Prophet's property is charity, except for the food and drink of his family. Our property cannot be inherited." (They also said): Yes." Thereupon, Abu Bakr (radiy-Allâhu anh) led the caliphate for two years, he said (exactly) what the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) did.' Then (Abu Buhteri, number 2963) I have a part of the hadith of Malik b. Aws. chanted more.
2978-) It was narrated from Hadrat Aisha that when she (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) died, her wives sent Uthman to Abu Bakr Siddiq and received one-eighth of the Prophet’s (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) property. They decided to ask (themselves) to ask for it. Thereupon, Hadrat Aisha said to them, Didn't the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) say, "We cannot inherit our property.

You said the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) said, "Our property cannot be inherited. It is charity that we left behind. However, this property is for the needs of Muhammad's family and hosting his guests.

2980-) Cübeyr b. Mutim (in) reported (according to) himself, Osman b. Together with Affan (radiy-Allâhu anh), they came to the presence of the Messenger of Allah, talking about how he (the Prophet) had divided khums (a share) between the sons of Hashim and the sons of Muttalib. (Jubayr ibn Mutim continued his words as follows) I said: "O Messenger of Allah (you have distributed some of the khums) to our brothers Muttalib sons, but you did not give us anything (from it). However, our closeness to you is the same as theirs." The Prophet (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) said: “The sons of Hashim and the sons of Muttalib are the same thing.” Jubayr (continuing his narration) said: (The Prophet) gave the sons of Hashim and the sons of Muttalib from this khums, to the sons of Abdushems and Nawfal. (Zuhri) said: Abu Bakr used to divide the khums just like the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam), but he would not give them the share that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) gave to his relatives. After Hadrat Umar, Osman (he would give them a share of hummus) farz'ül-humus 17.; Nesai, fey 1; İbn Mâce, jihad 46.

(Zuhri) said, Abu Bakr used to allocate a fifth share (between the right holders) just as the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) divided it. But he would not give (a share) to his relatives as the Messenger of Allah gave. Umar used to give them (a share). (Hazrat-i Osman), who was the caliph after him, would also give them (a share) of humus.
2982-) Said b. He said from al-Museyyeb: Jubayr b. Mutim said to him: When the day of Khaybar came, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) gave his (his) relatives' share in the khums to the sons of Hashim and the sons of Nawfal. (Hazrat-i Cübeyr continued his words and said.) I too, Osman b. I set out with Affan, and finally we arrived at the Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) and said, "O Messenger of Allah, these are the sons of Hashim. We do not deny their superiority (relative to us) because Allah has placed you among them, (but What is the situation of the sons of Muttalib, our brothers and sisters, that you gave them (shares) even though you left us. However, our closeness (to you) is the same (with them)?" we said. The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: We did not part with the sons of Muttalib, neither in the period of ignorance nor in the period of Islam. We and they are one thing." He said and interlocked his fingers.

Abbas (radiyallahu anh) also said: (I believe this share belongs to his relatives, to whom the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) gave it (in his health). He gave us (a share) as a relative of the Prophet. (However) we found this share (given by Hazrat Umar) less than our right, so we gave it back to him and refrained from taking it. fey 1.
2985-) Abdurrahman b. He said from Abi Layla: I heard Hadrat (radiyallahu anh) saying (like this). "The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) assigned me one-fifth of the khums (to distribute it to the rightful ones). A piece of property was brought to me (by Hazrat Umar). (Hazrat Umar) called me and said: You (as the relative of the Prophet) said, "You take it" (And distribute it to the places that need to be distributed as in the past). I said (I don't want to take over (his) administration.' And I said: We don't need him.' Then he (she took him) put him in the treasury.

(And the Messenger of Allah) did this. And I distributed this right (belonging to the relatives of the Prophet (pbuh) in the revenues of humus) during the life of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam). Then, Hazrat Abu Bakr gave this task to me. Finally, until the last year of Hazrat Umar's (caliphate) years (I carried out this duty, but I left this duty in the last year of Hazrat Umar's caliphate) because (that year) a lot of goods came to him (from booty). He also separated our rights. Then he sent me (a message) (asking me to arrive and distribute it to the rightful people). I said, "We don't need him this year, but Muslims (other than us, who are relatives of the Prophet) need him. Give it to them!" I gave the answer. He gave this property (which will fall to our share) to the poor Muslims. No one offered this to me after Hazrat Umar. When I met (me) Hadrat Abbas after leaving Hazrat Umar, he said (to me) "O Ali. Today you deprived us of (a large) income, this property will not be given to us forever."( was) (Really Abbas) was a very intelligent man.

O Messenger of Allah, you are the most devoted of people to Allah. You are the most observant of the rights of kinship. Our parents have nothing to give as mahr for us. Therefore, appoint us as officials to collect the zakat. Let us also benefit from the proceeds we will get out of charity and charity. they said. (Abdulmuttalib b. Rabia continued his words) said: While we (talk to your fathers) like this, Ali b. Abu Talib came. He said to us - No, by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said, "No one among you can be appointed as a zakat payer". You have obtained the groom's groom, but we are not jealous of you" (you are jealous of us). Ali took his robe over him and lay down on him and said: I am Hasan's father (among his tribe) and an experienced person. Abdulmuttalib (continuing his words) said, "Thereupon, I set out with Fazl (to ask the Prophet about this matter). We met him at the noon prayer (to the Prophet exactly). Prayer had begun. We prayed in congregation. Then I ran with Fazl to the door of the Prophet's (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) room. He was (staying) with Zaynab bint Chahsh that day. We were waiting at the door. Finally, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) came. He took my and Fazl's ear and said: "Take out what you're hiding" (let's see) and went in (in). He let me and Fazl in. For a while (Fazl and I) waited for each other to (receive) the word. Then I talked to the Prophet or Fazl spoke. Ibn Shihab-Az-Zuhri said that Abdullah, who narrated this hadith to me, hesitated. -(I mean, he couldn't remember exactly which one started the conversation. Abdulmuttalib continued his words like this). (Fazl) told the Prophet about the matter that our fathers had ordered us (to ask). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remained silent for a while, staring at the ceiling. (This silence) seemed so long to us that we thought we would not give any answer. Finally, we saw Zeyneb (our mother) pointing at us from behind the curtain. He meant (with this sign) to (to us) do not rush. And he wanted (to tell) that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was busy with our business. Then the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) lowered his head and said to us, "This zakat is the dirt of people's (property)." It is not permissible to receive zakat to Muhammad and his family. Call me Nawfal ibn al-Harith. Haris was called and said (turning to him) to marry Nawfal Abdulmuttalib (your daughter). Thereupon, Nawfal married me (his daughter), then the Prophet (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said to me: Mahmiyye b. Call Juz." he commanded. He married Fazl (his daughter) in Mahmiyye.

When I wanted to marry Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam), I took a promise from a jeweler from the sons of Kaynuka that he would come with me. We were going to bring dyegrass. I want to sell this herb to jewelers and take advantage of it at my wedding feast. While I was collecting saddles, sacks and ropes for my camels, my camels were sitting next to the house of a man from the Ansar. When I gathered what I was going to gather, I headed (to my camels). What should I see, their humps were cut off, their flanks were pierced, and some of their lungs were removed. I couldn't hold back my tears when I saw this scene. And I cried out, "Who did this?" (those who were there) "Perhaps it was Hamza ibn Abdulmuttalib who did this. He is (now) among some of the Ansar drinkers in that house. A concubine sang to him and his friends in his song -O Hamza! To watch out for fat camels (he sang a song). Then Hamza immediately took up the sword, cut off the humps of the camels, pierced their flanks, and took some of their lungs." they said. (Hazrat Ali continued his words as follows): Then I set out. Finally, I went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Next to Zayd b. There was Harris. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) immediately understood what had happened to me and said, "What happened to you?" I said, "O Messenger of Allah, I have never seen anything like it today.

Hamza was also drunk. His eyes were red. Hamza fixed his eyes on the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam), then raised his eyes and fixed them on his (the Prophet's) neck.

I went to the presence of the Prophet with my sister and the Prophet's daughter Fatima. We complained to him about the situation we were in and asked the slave concubines to give it to us (to help us in our work). The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam): The orphans (of the martyrs who lost their lives in the war) came before you. But shall I show you something better than this?

Standing up after (the prayer has been performed) and saying: Does one of you lean on his chair and think that Allah has not forbade anything other than what is forbidden in the Qur'an? Know this well: By Allah, I (both) advised (and ordered some things) and prohibited (some things). (These things that I command and forbid) are as much as the (prohibitions) in the Qur'an. Or more than that. Allah has not made it lawful for you to enter the houses of the people of the book without your permission, nor has He made it lawful for you to attack their wives and eat your fruits when they pay their taxes."

Finally, I performed the night prayer, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) returned to his family. I asked permission (to enter) with him, he gave permission. A polytheist whom I had taken told me as follows: There is no property next to you or me who will pay this to my account. If it is, it means that I am in a disgraceful situation. Therefore, I said, 'Let me flee to one of those tribes that converted to Islam until Allah grants His Messenger (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) wealth to pay off my debt!' I put my bag, shoes and shield (to take with me on my trip the next day) that I put in it.

Then he said, "Didn't you see the four camels kneeling down?" I replied: Yes. On top of that, theirs and what's on them are yours. They have clothing and food on them. The head of Fedek gave them to me as a gift. (Now) take them and pay your debt!" He said. So I did. (Hazrat Bilal continued his words) and told the rest of the hadith. (For a while) "Then I went to the mosque. I saw the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) sitting in the mosque. I greeted him: What happened to the (debt) on him?" He said, "Allah the Almighty paid everything that was on Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) and there was nothing left.” After the debt was paid from the goods, something increased. “Yes?” I said. Try to get me out of the trouble of keeping ten. Because until you save me from this, I can't go to any of my family members." He said, "What happened to the property with him?" she asked. And I (still) He is with me. Because no one (in need) came to me to whom I could give him.' When he prayed, he called me (again) What happened to the property with him?" she asked. I said: O Messenger of Allah, Allah saved you from him.' you said. Thereupon, he said, "Allahu akbar Alhamdulillah!" said. Then (he went away) I followed him. Finally, he went to his wives, greeted each of them separately, and went to bed. This is what you asked (from me) (the sustenance of the Messenger of Allah)."

Fear Allah, abandon what you have done, because it is not halal for you, he used to say. Then the next day she would meet him again, but what she did yesterday wouldn't prevent her from eating, drinking and sitting with him. When they did this, Allah confused their hearts with one another (He made the hearts of those who did not commit sins to be compatible with those of those who committed sin). The verses of David and Jesus, son of Mary, were cursed with their tongue, which started with: "But most of them are wicked." Maida: 5/78-81. He read until the end of the verse above. Then he said: Beware, by Allah, you either enjoin the good and forbid the evil, take the hand of the oppressor and turn him to the truth, and hold him to the truth (or confuse your hearts with each other), the part inside is not present in this narration. However, this appreciation is needed in order to understand the meaning. The next narration contains this addition. Tirmidhi, Tafsîru'l - The Qur'an, 5,6,7: Ibn Mace. fithen 20.

Ravi added: ......Or Allah will mix the hearts of some of you with those of others. Then he will curse you as he cursed them." Dawud said: His warrior is from Ala bin Musayyeb, he is from Abdullah bin Amr bin Murra, he is from Salim al-Aflas, he is from Abu Ubayda, Abu Ubayda also narrated from Abdullah.

Wahb ibn Bakiyya reported from Khalid that Bakr said: We heard the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) say: "Surely, when people see oppression, if they can't prevent it even though they can, they will face the punishment of Allah. It is very near to descend upon them all." It was narrated from Husayn that Abu Bakr said: I heard the Messenger of Allah say: "A nation whose evil is committed among them, and then they do not change it even though they are able to change it, then Allah will surely inflict a general torment on them in the near future."

Hennad cut the hadith short. Abu'l Ala narrated the entire hadith. He concluded it as follows." If he is not able to (change with his hand), with his tongue (to change) If he is not able to (change) with his tongue, with his heart (let him change) This last one is the weakest of faith." al-Iyman 78: Timiz, fitan 11; Ibn Mace, fitan 21; Nesai, iyman 17.

I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) about him. He replied: Advise one another to goodness. Forbid evil. According to an explanation in Aynu'l-Ma'budla, the meaning is "Perform goodness, avoid evil." So much so that a stinginess that is obeyed, the world that is preferred to the self-desires (hereafter) preferred, and if you see that each viewer likes their own view, do your part. "Abandon the people, there are days of patience behind you. Patience on that day is like holding a fire in the palm of your hand. Whoever does a good deed in those days has the reward of fifty people who do the same as he did." someone else added to my question: O Messenger of Allah, is it the reward of fifty people?! said.

Both of them asked the Messenger of Allah for a task. The Messenger of Allah was silent. The phrase, which means "the Messenger of Allah is silent", is in the form of "The Messenger of Allah's tooth was fringing the miswak" in the narrations of Bukhari and Muslim. Also, in Muslim, the word "Nabi" was used instead of "Rasûlullah". Thereupon: What are you saying, Abu Musa? or: What about Abdullah? b. Qays?" said.

Then these two Companions discussed the night prayer. I sleep and pray. I pray; or: I pray and I sleep. Doubt is from your narrator. istitabetü'l-murteddin 3; Muslim, Imare 15; Ahmed b. Hanbal, IV, 409. The explanation of the hadith will come after the hadith no. 4357.

Uthman brought him and made him stop in the presence of the Messenger of Allah. He said, 'O Messenger of Allah, accept Abdullah's pledge. (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) raised his head and looked at him. (Osman radiyallahu anh) repeated this three times, and the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) avoided giving security each time.

Thereupon, he took the dagger, thrust it into the woman's stomach, and loaded it on her, killing her. A child fell between his feet. The woman smeared it (the bed) with blood. When it happened, the incident was told to the Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) gathered the people and said: I refer the person who did this job to Allah (I am looking for him by swearing in the name of Allah). Surely, I have a right over him (his obedience is obligatory) but except if he stands up." But he stood up, swaying and swaying, he came and sat in front of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) and said: O Messenger of Allah! I'm the owner. He used to curse you and say ugly things about you. I would not listen to him, I would not give up. , I loaded on him and killed him!' He said (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam): Be careful! Bear witness that the blood of that woman is waste.” tahrimu'd-dem 15.

If you had not asked me that, I would not have informed you. We find stoning as punishment. However, adultery has increased among our notables. When we caught a man from among the notables, we would let him go, and when we caught a weak man, we would impose the limit on him.

One of them is the one that came through Macmer. he said: A man and a woman committed adultery. To each other: Let's go to that Prophet. Undoubtedly, he is a prophet sent to lighten. If he gives us a fatwa other than recim, we accept it. He needs it in the presence of Allah and we say, "It's a fatwa of one of your prophets." They said, "Sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) while he was sitting in the mosque among his companions, they came and said: "O Ebe'l-Qasim! What do you say about the adulterous man and woman?" they said.

When someone who commits adultery is muhsan, what punishment do you find in the Torah about him?" His face is painted with coal, glorified and beaten with a stick." they said.

Belat in Belat that enters from there: It is a kind of stone with the dictionary. However, it was named after a place in Medina. That is the purpose here. He heard the words of Uthman (radiyallahu anh) entered there and came up to us in a changed state and said: "They were threatening to kill me just now." We said, "O Emir, Allah is enough for you against them." Why do they (want) to kill me?!

Cessâme el-Leysi killed a man from the Eşca' clan during the Islamic period. -This is the first diet that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) ruled- -Uyeyna spoke about the murder of al-Ashcai.

Meanwhile, voices rose, enmity and noise increased. Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam): O Uyeyna! Don't you accept the diet?" Uyayna said, "No, by Allah, I do not accept it, until her women fall into the grief and distress that my women fell into." Wake up! Don't you accept the diet?" he commanded. Uyeyne repeated what she had said before. Finally, a man named Mukaytil from the Banu Leys tribe, who was wearing armor and a weapon in his hand, stood up and said: Messenger of Allah! I can find no other example than a flock of sheep for what this did in those early days of Islam; It is as follows: When the herd reaches the water, if the ones in front are stoned, the ones behind will run away. Practice your sunnah (about qisas) today. Change it tomorrow if you want. This sentence is the meaning of hirdarb-ı parable. Necessary explanation will be made during the explanation. said.

He added to the salutation: Muhallim, wiping his tears with the tip of his dress, got up." Ibn Majah. diet 4. Ibn Ishaq said: His people claimed that after that, the Messenger of Allah asked forgiveness for him.
4506-) Abu Shurayh al-Ka'bî (radiy-Allâhu anh) said (as reported): (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) said: Beware, O Huzaa community! You killed this victim of Huzayl. I'm paying for his diet. After my words, when a man is killed, his family has a choice between taking a diet or killing the murderer (in short)." Diât 13, Ahmed, IV: 32. VI. 385.
4507-) Abu Hurayra (radiy-Allâhu anh) said: When it was conquered, the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) stood up and said: Whoever’s man is killed, it is a choice between two things; He said: "either paying a diet or doing retaliation."

Walid, the other Ahmed b. Abraham. Metin Ahmed b. It is the story of Abraham. A difference in the narration of Abbas is pointed out in the text. said. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said, "Write for Abu Shat". Ibn 39 diyat 8 lukata 7; Muslim, vol 447, 448; Tirmidhi, Ibn 12; Ahmad, III, 230. It is the wording of Ahmad's hadith. David said: "Write for me" means, write the sermon of the Messenger of Allah for me.
4508-) Amr b. Shuayb narrated from his grandfather, through his father, that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said: Whoever kills a believer outright, will be handed over to the victim's guardian. If they want, they can kill the murderer, if they want, they can take a diet." Diyai 17; Ibn Mâce. diât 21.
4509-) Jabir b. Abdillah (radiy-Allâhu anh) said (reported): (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) said: “The one who kills (the murderer) after taking a diet should not see abundance.” III. 363.
4510-) Hisham b. According to Zayd's narration; Enes b. Malik (radiyallahu anh) (said): A woman brought a poisonous sheep to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), and the Messenger of Allah ate it. (Afterward) the woman was brought. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) asked the woman why she did this. “I wanted to kill him,” he said. (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam): Allah is the one who makes you responsible for this job –or: on me. It will not infect him." He said, "Shall we not kill them?" They asked. (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) replied, "No." Anas says: The word "lehevat", which we call it (the sign of poison) in the meat at the end of the throat of the Messenger of Allah, as "meat in his throat" is cemimi. The curriculum of the word is "lehât" and it means "little tongue". Meat in throat science is also given this name. The translation was made according to this second meaning. Because minor language has no plural. I saw and stopped. grant 28; Muslim, salam 45; Ahmed, III, 218.
4511-) From Abu Huraira (radiyallahu anh); It is narrated as follows: A Jewish woman gave poisonous sheep to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) did not punish the woman in any way." Dawud said: This Jewish woman who poisoned the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) is Marhab's sister.
4512-) Jabir b. Abdillah (radiyallahu anh) used to narrate: A Jewish woman put poison in a roasted sheep. Then he presented it to the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam). The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) took the arm (front leg) of the sheep and ate it. A group of his companions ate with him. Then the Messenger of Allah said to them: . Raise your hands (stop eating).” she asked. The woman said: Who informed you?” The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said, pointing to the arm (in his hand): This is what I have in my hand. Yes. The woman said: If she is a prophet, she will not harm her, if she is not a prophet, I said, we will get rid of her." The hadith is denial. Because Zuhri did not hear a hadith from Jabir. The Prophet (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) forgave the woman, but did not punish her. One of those who ate it died. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) had blood drawn from between his shovels because of the meat he ate. From him, Abu Hind took blood with a horn and a knife. Abu Hind was the freedman of Banu Beyada from the Ansar.
4513-) It was narrated from Abu Salama (radiy-Allâhu anh) that (he said): A Jewish woman gave a lamb roasted in fire as a gift to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). The narrator recited a hadith similar to the hadith of Jabir (above): Bishr b. Berâ b. Ma'rûr al-Ansari died. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah sent word to the Jewish woman (calling). He said to her: Why did you do such a thing?' He again said the same hadith of Jabir.- he ordered and the woman was killed. The narrator of the hadith did not mention the issue of having blood drawn. This hadith is mursal. From Abu Huraira (radiyallahu anh); he said: : The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) would accept the gift and would not eat alms." The hadith is not available in the Bezlu'l-Machud copy. The next one in Avnü'l-Ma'bud. mentioned together with the hadith. The hadith of Musannif. His inclusion among the hadiths describing that the Messenger of Allah wanted to be poisoned is due to the fact that the Messenger of Allah accepted the sheep that was given to him as a gift. (From the narrators) Muhammed b. Amr; Abu Salama (saying) -he did not mention Abu Hurayra- said: "The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) would accept gifts but would not accept charity." -Ravi (Abu Salama) added the following: -A Jewish woman, Khaybar. He gave him a lamb that was roasted in the fire and put poison in it as a gift. The Messenger of Allah and the people ate from it. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: Take your hands off! He informed me that it is poisonous." Bishr b. al-Barâ b. Ma'rûr al-Ansari died. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) sent a message to the woman and said to her: "Why did you do such a thing?" Thereupon, the woman was killed by the order of the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said during his illness when he passed away: I kept feeling the effect of the bite I ate in Khaybar. Right now, my veins are translated as “veins,” the word ebher means two veins in the back, veins in the heart, veins in the arms. It is the moment when it cuts." meghazi X3; Darimi. Mukaddime 11; Ahmed, VI: 18.
4515-) Ka'b b. The son of Malik (radiy-Allâhu anh) narrated from his father (Ka'b b. Malik) that he said: What do you think is the reason? O Messenger of Allah! I do not think that anything other than the poisonous sheep he ate (with you) was the cause of my son's (disease) as well." Dawud said: Abdurrazzaq narrated this hadith from the Messenger of Allah as a mursal, sometimes with the accusation of Ma'mar and Zuhri. Sometimes Zuhri and Abdurrahman b. Ka'h b. He narrated it with the accusation of Malik. as he reported; Ma'mer informed them of the hadith once as mursal, that they wrote it like that, and once he narrated it as musnad and that they wrote it like that. In our opinion, all of these are true. He said: When Ibn al-Mubarak came to Mamer, he narrated the hadiths that he had narrated as ma'mar to him as musnad (that is, without any breaks in his texts).
4516-) Abdurrahman b. Abdullah b. Ka'b b. From the mother of Malik, Umm Mübeşşir, -Ebû Said b. Al-A'rabi said: Thus, he said from his mother, from his father, he should have said from Uuimu Mubashshir," and narrated that (Umm Mubashshir) entered the presence of Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam)- (Ravi), Mihlad b. He narrated Khalid's hadith like the hadith of Jabir and said: Bishr bin al-Bara b. Ma'rûr died. The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) sent a message to the Jewish woman and said to her: The one who prompted you for this thing you did. What?" she asked. He narrated a hadith similar to Jabir's, and also mentions: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) ordered and the woman was killed." He did not mention the issue of having blood drawn.
4517-) Samura (radiyallahu anh) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: Whoever kills his slave, we will kill him. Whoever cuts off his slave's limbs (nose, ear...) we will cut off his limbs. diyat 17; Nesai. kasâme 11.17; Ibn Majah. diât 23; Dârimi, diât 7; Ahmed, V. 10.11.12.18:20.
4518-) The above hadith is narrated from Qatada (radiy-Allâhu anh) with the same isnâd and text. (in this narration) he said: (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) said: Whoever castrates his slave (who sheds his eggs), we will also castrate him. , Abu Dawud at-Tayalisi narrated from Hisham like Muadh's hadith.
4519-) A similar hadith was narrated from Qatada with the attribution of Branch. The narrator also added the following in this narration: Then Hasen (Hasenü'l-Basrî, the natural narrator of the first hadith) forgot this hadith. That's why he used to say, "A free person cannot be killed for a slave".
4520-) Muslim b. Ibrahim informed us, Hisham informed us from Qatada and he informed us from Hasen; Hasen (ul-Basri); Retaliation is not applied in return for a free slave,' he said.
4521-) Amr b. Shuayb narrated from his grandfather that he said: A man who wanted came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) and said: His concubine, O Messenger of Allah! (My master tormented me because of a concubine belonging to him, O Messenger of Allah!)" He said (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) said. Disaster! He saw a concubine that belonged to his master, and she went to great lengths to cut off her genitals. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said, "Bring the man to me." The man was searched but could not be brought. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said, "Go, you are free. The man said: O Messenger of Allah! Who will help me (whose duty is it to help me)?" He said: "To all believers" or "to all Muslims" He said Shaq is narrated. : He is Ravh's father Zinba. He was the Slave's Mawla.
4522-) Sahl b. Ebî Has'ame and Rafi b. It has been narrated from Hadic (radiy-Allâhu anhuma) that (they said): b. Mes'ud and Abdullah b. They went to Sahl, Khaybar and separated from each other in the palm grove. Abdullah b. Sahl was killed. They accused the Jews. His brother Abdurrahman b. Sahl and his uncle's sons, Huveyyisa and Muhayyisa, came to the presence of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). Abdurrahman spoke about what happened to his brother, even though he was the youngest of them. Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) said, “Let the big talk be big” -or: “Let the big one begin.” The figure here belongs to the narrator. Thereupon, both of them (Huveyyisa and Muhayyisa) talked about their friends (uncle's sons). The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: "If fifty of you take an oath against a man from among them, his rope (you) will be given." They said, "How can we swear by something we cannot see?! (We cannot swear)". (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) said: “Then, the Jews will come clean against you with the oath of fifty of their own.” O Messenger of Allah! (b. Abi Hasme) says: One day I entered their camel pen and one of the camels kicked me." said this or similar. adab 89, jizyah 12; Muslim, kasâme 1,2; Tirmidhi, diât 22; Nesai, kasâme 4; Ibn Mace, Diyat 28: Ahmed, IV, 2.3. Dawud said: This hadith was narrated by Bisr b. al- Müfaddal and Malik, Yahya b. They narrated from Said. Yahya said in this narration that the Messenger of Allah said: "Do you deserve the blood of your friend or murderer by swearing fifty times?" Bishr did not mention "blood." He began his narration with the following statement of the Messenger of Allah: The Jews will clear you against you with fifty oaths they will take." Yahya did not mention "deserving blood". David says, "This is a delusion from Ibn Uyayna."
4523-) Sahl b. Ebi Hasme and some of the elders of his wife reported that: b. Sahl and Muhayyisa set out for Khaybar because of a famine. Muhayyisa, Abdullah b. It was reported that Sahl was killed and thrown into a well or a pit. Considering the explanation of Avnü'l-Ma'bud, it was made according to the obscure pronunciation of the verbs. It is possible to translate the same sentence as "Muhayyisa came and informed that Abdullah bin Sahl was killed and thrown into a pit or a well," by reading the verbs. He came to the Jews and said: By Allah, you killed him. The Jews said: By Allah, we did not kill him. Then he turned and came to his own people. He told them what had happened. Then his elder brother Huveyyisa and Abdurrahman b. They came with Sahl. -He was the one in Khaybar- he went (to the Messenger of Allah) to talk. The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said, "Enlarge, enlarge (let your elder talk)" referring to his age. Then Huveyyisa spoke, then Muhayyisa spoke. He (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said: (Jews) either give your friend's diet or declare that they have declared war (against Allah and His Messenger). He also wrote this to the Jews. The Jews also wrote: By Allah, we did not kill him. (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam): He said to Huveyyisa, Muhayyisa and Abdurrahman: Do you swear and deserve your friend's blood? They said no. The Messenger of Allah said: "Let the Jews take an oath for you, hereditary?" They said, "They are not Muslims." Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah gave his diet from his own side. He sent them a hundred female camels. So much so that the camels were brought into their homes. Sahl said: One of those camels, a red camel kicked me." diyat 12; Muslim, kasâme 6; Nesai, kasâme 4; İbn Mâce, dîât 28.

He killed a man from Malik by means of kasâme. and the murderer was one of them (from me, Nasr b. Malik). It is Mahmud's words. The word "Bahra by the Lyyya" was mentioned only by Mahmud. Musannif to Abu Dâvûd: Mahmud b. Khalid, Kathir b. Ubayd and Muhammad b. There are three different narrators in the names Sabbah. The text above is the narration of Mahmud b. Khalid. There is no word "Bahra on the side of the Liyya" in the narrations of Kathir b. Ubayd and Muhammad b. Sabbath. The narration of these people is: ) in Riga. He killed a man from Nasr b. Malik by means of kasâme". There is no sentence in their narration that "both the murderer and the victim were from them".

There they separated from each other. Then they found one of them murdered. To the people whose friends they found with them; They said, "You killed our friend.

The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said to them, "Can you give me an explanation about who killed this?" They said: "We don't have any evidence." The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: Shall they (Jews) take an oath for you? The Messenger of Allah did not like to waste the victim's blood and gave him a hundred camels of charity (zakat) and his diet. Diyat 22: Muslim, kasâme 5; Nesai, kasâme 3.5; Ibn Majah. diot 28; Malik, kasâme I.

They are Jews; they dare things greater than that." He (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) said: Choose fifty of them (Jews) and make them take an oath.” The deceased’s parents did not agree to this. Thereupon, the Prophet (pbuh) paid the deceased’s diet from his side.
4527-) Abdurrahman b. From Buceyd (radiyallahu anh); Muhammed b. Ibrahim; By Allah, Sahl (b. Has'ame) had delusions in the hadith."

4529-) Enes b. From Malik (radiyallahu anh); He said: A concubine was found with her head crushed between two stones. Himself: Who did this to you? He was asked, "Something or something?" (This continued until the name of a Jew was mentioned), (when the name of the Jew was mentioned) he nodded (yes). The Jew was caught and confessed his crime. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) He ordered the head of the Jew to be crushed with a stone, too. Vesâyâ 5, dîât 7; Muslim, kasâme 15; Tirmidhi, diyat 6; İbn Mâce, dîât 24; Nesâî, kasâme 13; Dârimi, diyat 4.
4530-) From Enes (radiyallahu anh); It has been narrated that (he said); The Jew killed a concubine from the Ansar because of an ornament in her; Then he threw it into a well.

4532-) Kays b. From Ubad (radiyallahu anh); It is narrated that he went to Hadrat Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) together and said: Did the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) recommend you something that he did not will to all people? we said. Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) said: No, but with the exception of this book of mine…” He took out a book.” Ahmed, on the other hand; He took a book out of the bag of his sword. The hadith was narrated by Musannif Abu Dâvûd by Ahmed b. Hanbal and Müsedded. In the narration of Müsedded: "Ali took out a book," said Ahmed b. Hanbel said, "Kılınç took a book out of his bag." In that letter was this: their blood is equal. To others they are like one hand. Even if they are at the lowest level, they know their trust. Let me know! A believer cannot be killed in return for an unbeliever (by way of qisas) during his covenant (and a non-Muslim) with an unbeliever. If a person creates something (commits a murder), the punishment is only for himself. Whoever establishes something or harbors a creator (the murderer), may the curse of Allah, the angels and all humans be upon him. Jihad 167; Nesai, kasâme 13; Tirmidhi, Diyat 16; Ibn Majah, diyat 21.

Ubayd says: She is the caliph when she becomes pregnant and remains so for up to ten months. When he reaches ten months, his name is; It will be usher.

So what would you recommend to us?" (Tell me so we know), he said. (Our Master Fahr-i kainat also): I advise you to fear Allah (the rulers at your head) and listen and obey even if he is an Abyssinian slave. For whoever of you lives after me will witness many (religious) conflicts. Therefore, cling to my sunnah and the sunnah of my caliphs who are on my right path. Remember these sunnahs (as if) your teeth (so that they never come out again). I forbid you (in the name of religion) from the things that are put forward later. Because everything that is put forward afterwards is a bid'ah, and every bid'ah is heresy." ilm 16; Ibn Majah, muqaddime 16; Ahmed b. Hanbal, IV, 126, 127.

And one day he said: Surely there are (some) trials before you. At that time, the wealth increases (by people everywhere) and the Qur'an (I-Karim) is opened (read the rope). In fact, believers, hypocrites, men, women, small, big, free, slave (everyone) can take (and read) the Qur'an. A spokesperson (seeing to himself that everyone reads the Qur'an like this but does not understand it and follows the devil and deviates to various innovations): What is the matter with these people that they do not follow me even though I read the Qur'an? The days are near when he will say that they will not suit me unless I (in the name of religion) reveal things that are against the Qur'an. I warn you against the innovations that are introduced (in the name of religion, against religion). Because (such) innovations in the name of religion are superstitious. I also warn you from the error of a scholar. Because the devil sometimes makes the tongue of the scholar say the superstitious word. Sometimes the hypocrite speaks the truth." b. Amira) said to Muadh ibn Jabal: May Allah have mercy on you (well, but), how can I understand that a scholar sometimes speaks falsehood and a hypocrite sometimes speaks the truth?" said. (Hazrat-i Muaz) replied: Yes, you (act like this): The scholar who caught everyone's eyes and about (by people): What is this? Beware of the words they say (and react). (This is one of the perverted words that the scholar escaped from his mouth.) But don't let the fact that the scholar is sometimes mistaken like this should not deter you from listening to his (his words). Because it is possible (for all time) to return (from that word to the truth). And when you hear the truth, take it (regardless of whose mouth it comes out). Because there is light on the right. Dawud says: He narrated this hadith from Zuhri in Ma'mar. (However, Ma'mer:) He quoted the word "yurt iyenneke" (meaning "don't let him take you away from him") instead of the word "La yusniyenneke" which means "don't make you give up".

He narrated as "la yusniyenneke". Ishaq also said that Zuhri narrated (this hadith) as follows: Yes (the word of the scholar man) is the one that seems suspicious to you and you even ask (yourself) what does (this man) mean by this word. Ishaq also said that Zuhri narrated (this hadith) as follows: Yes (the word of the scholar man) is the one that seems suspicious to you and you even ask (yourself) what does (this man) mean by this word.
4614-) Sufyan (as-Sevri) (radiyallahu anh) said (reported): A man wrote a letter to Omar Ibn Abdii-Aziz to ask about his destiny (meaning). (Hazrat Umar Ibn Abdil-Aziz also wrote a letter to this man (give this answer)- "Let's come to our subject (O the owner of the letter!) Let's ask you to fear Allah, to follow the middle path in (fulfilling) Allah's command. I advise you to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) and to abandon the bid'ats (in the name of religion) that were not left to the bid'atists (by Allah) after the sunnah came into effect, because what you need is to hold on to the sunnah. By Allah's leave, sunnah is a guarantee for you. Know that no matter how many bid'ahs people put forward, it is definitely a proof (in the Qur'an or sunnah) of its evil before this bid'ah (it will not be revealed), or its There has been a mention about it because (as a way) a person who knows the sunnah (as a way) and the side of the sunna - such as making mistakes, stumbles, folly, causing difficulties. - However, Ibn Kathir did not use the word "who knows".- (Ibn Kathir According to the narration of Hazrat Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz, the letter He continues as follows: O letter holder) choose the path chosen by the Companions (for themselves), too. Because they had a knowledge (that they were). They stay away from (against religion) with an opinion that penetrates (the root of matters), and they are certainly stronger (than others) in comprehending (the truth of) (religious) affairs. (Binaenalaih Sahâbe-i Kiram) are more deserving (to be taken as an example) in religious matters because of their (these) virtues. bidatists)! If (in your opinion) the guidance is the innovations on which you are following, then it means that you reached it (hidayet) before them. (However, it is clear that this opinion of yours is completely wrong and unfounded). If you say that after them, some new things emerged (for this reason, we also created bid'ahs); Know that those (these bid'ahs) that emerged after them were brought forward by a person who followed a path other than theirs and turned away from them. Because the Companions of the Companions have said enough about religion (needs of future generations) and made the explanation that will heal (them). There cannot be a narrowing under their (restrictions) or a width (doing, correct) above the width they (makes). They have exceeded their limits (they have also exceeded the limit. However, the Companions are on the right path between these two extravagances.) In your letter (O owner of the letter), you ask about faith in destiny. By Allah's leave, I asked the one who knows (this issue). I don't believe that any innovation he put forward (in the name of religion) and any innovation developed by the innovators is more open than belief in qadar as a (religious) work and issue. accident and destiny (belief) only strengthened it (by making it obligatory to believe in it). He talked about fate in many hadiths. Muslims heard the explanations about destiny from him, and they talked about destiny while he was alive and after his death, believing strongly and surrendering to Allah. They talked about destiny, seeing themselves as incompetent and mistaken (thinking) that something is outside of Allah's knowledge, that (Allah's eternal) destiny has not determined it, and that Allah's (eternal) predestination has not been found for that thing. However, destiny is also present in Allah's Qur'an, whose meaning is clear. They (the Companions) took their belief in fate from the Qur'an and learned their faith in it from the Qur'an. (O bidatists)! If you say: (If that is the case), why did Allah send down such and such a verse (which seems contrary to the belief in qadar) and why did he say such words (contrary to this belief)? If you say (I say to you): They recited what you read from the Qur'an (as well as the Companions) and they sensed (some) meanings (from it) that you did not know. And then: All these (events that occur in the universe) are (come to be) by an (eternal) destiny and predestination, and they are appreciated. What Allah willed has happened, and what He has not willed has not happened. They said, "We do not have the power to benefit or harm ourselves."
4615-) It was narrated from Nafi (radiy-Allâhu anh): (Hazrat-i Abdullah) Ibn Omar had a friend from Damascus with whom he corresponded (learning that he did not accept his belief in destiny) Abdullah Ibn Omar wrote a letter to him (one in this sense). Wrote. "(The news) that you said some (denying) words about qadar reached me. (Binaenalayh) do not write to me again. Because I told the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) 'There will be some tribes in my ummah who deny qadar. ' I heard you say."
4616-) Khalid Ibn al-Hazza said to Hasen (-i Basrî) "Is Adam (aleyhis-salâm) for (living) in the sky or (later descending from the sky to the earth) to (living) on the earth? Was it created for you, let me know" I said. No, that place was (created) to (live and reproduce)." said. "He didn't have to eat from that tree," he replied. And I said: (Then) to me (who gives the impression that people are compelled in their actions): You will not be able to drag anyone into strife against him. I said, "Explain verses as-Saffat(37), 162-163, except of course(s) who will enter Hell. He interpreted (these verses): "The devils cannot mislead anyone other than those whom Allah has ordained to enter Hell, and cause them to cause strife."
4617-) Khalid al-Hazza, Hasan (I Basri) "(Allah) has created them for this." Hud(11). He said that he explained the 119th verse as "these (that is, the believers) were created for this (heaven) and those (that is, the unbelievers) were created for (hell)".
4618-) Khalid al-Hazza said to Hasan-i Basrî (radiy-Allâhu anh), "You will not be able to drag anyone into sedition except those who will go to hell against him." Saffat (37). 162-163. I asked about the verses of the verses, and he (devils) replied, "They can only mislead anyone whom Allah has ordained to enter Hell."
4619-) Hammad (Ibn Zayd) said that Humayd (Ibn Abi Humayd) said: Hasan-i Basrî (radiy-Allâhu anh) used to say: "It is better to fall from the sky to the ground than to say, "The job is in my own hands."
4620-) Humayd said: Hasan-i (Basri, one day) came to us in Mecca. The fiqh scholars of the people of Makkah told me to sit down with the fiqh scholars of Makkah and talk to him about advising them. (After that, I talked to him about this issue. He accepted my request): He answered yes (it will be). Thereupon, (the scholars of Makkah) gathered in one place (Hasan-i Basri gave a speech to them. In fact, I did not see a better orator than him). Someone (who was present) asked (to Hazrat Hasan-i Basri): O Abu Said, who created the devil?” (Hasan-i Basri said): Subhanallah! Is there a creator other than Allah? He created the good (Allah) and created the evil!” gave the answer. The man (asking the question) said (when he received this answer), "God damn them; how they are making up lies about this sheikh."
4621-) Hasan-i basri from Humayd (reportedly); This is how we insert him into the hearts of criminals." Hijr (15), 12. (in the verse) interpreted the word "him" as "shirk".

4623-) Ibn Aun said: I was walking in Damascus (streets). Someone called me from behind. I turned and looked. Turns out it was Reca Ibn Hayve. He said (to me): O Abu Awn, what is the (original) thing that (these people) keep saying about Hasan-i Basri?" (I replied: "Really, they are producing a lot of lies in the name of Hasan".
4624-) Hammad said: I heard Ayyub es-Sahtiyani say: There are two parts of the people who lie in the name of Hasen (al-Basri). The people (consisting of the first part) are those who have the view that (there is no) destiny. With these lies (they produced in the name of Hazrat Hasan), they want to spread their views. Other people (consisting of the second part) are people with hatred and anger in their hearts for Hasan-i Basri. (These are also about him); They lie on his behalf by saying, "Didn't he say that, didn't he say that?"
4625-) Yahya Ibn Kathir said: Kurre b. Khalid used to say to us: O young people, do not get carried away with Hasan-i Basri (the allegations that he is from the sect of qadariyya). (Know well that contrary to the claims) his view was the sunnah and the truth."
4626-) Ibn Avn said: If we knew that Hasn-i Basrî's words (about destiny) would spread (in such a wrong way among the people), we would write a book about his refusal from these words and hold witnesses to it. But we (since we did not know that these words could be misunderstood; these are some words that came out of Hazrat Hasan's mouth), they cannot be drawn into meanings that have nothing to do with them; we said.
4627-) Ayyub (as-Sahtiyani) said: Hasan (-i Basrî) said to me: I will never again say something like it (words I said about fate that are susceptible to being misunderstood)".
4628-) Osman - al-Betti said: Hassan (-i Basri) interpreted every verse about the existence of destiny."
4629-) Ibn Umar said that in the time of the Prophet (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam): We do not equate any of the Companions with Abu Bakr (on the contrary, we consider him superior to all of them. After that), Umar (we do not equate anyone) in the same way. then to Osman in the same way (we do not equate anyone). We leave the (other) Companions of the Prophet (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) (to their own devices); we would not rank them (according to another narration: there is no distinction of virtue among the others).
4630-) Salim Ibn Abdullah narrated that (Abdullah) Ibn Umar said: While we Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) were alive: The most virtuous of the Ummah of the Prophet (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) is Abu Bakr after the Prophet. Then Omer, then Osman. May God be pleased with all of them, we would say"

It is Omar, he replied. Who is he, I say, Osman, I was afraid that he would answer. (I didn't ask this question). Thereupon: Then it is you, O my father! said. I am just one of the liars, he replied. fedail 5; Ibn Majah, introduction 11.
4632-) Muhammad al-Firyabi reported that Sufyan-es-Sawri said: Whoever claims that Ali Aleyhis Salam is more worthy of the caliphate than Abu Bakr and Omar (radiy-Allâhu anh) , he would have attributed a mistake to both 'Umar and the emigrants and the Ansar. I do not think that such a person's deeds will rise to the heavens with such an attitude."
4633-) Abbad es-Semmak said: I am Sufyan al-Sawri: The caliphs are five: Abu Bakr, Omar, Osman, Ali and Omar Ibn Abdi'l-Aziz. God bless them," I heard him say.
4634-) Abu Hurayra (radiyallahu anh) narrated from Ibn Abbas (radiyallahu anh) that: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) and said: (O Allah's Messenger!)

(Thereupon, Hadrat Adam said: Are you one of the prophets of the Children of Israel, the prophet with whom Allah spoke from behind a veil without intervening with a messenger from among His creatures?' (Musa also said): Yes!" gave the answer. Didn't you find (among the revelations that came to you) that this was preordained in Allah's Book before I was created? said. Yes, he said.

Allah is not one-eyed." adab 77; fitan 26, jihad 178; anbiya 3; Muslim, fitan, 95, 101; Abu Dawud, melahim 14; Tirmidhi, filen 56, 62, Ibn Mâce, fitan 33; Ahmed b. Hanbal, I, 176, 182; 11.27, 149; VI, 140.
4760-) Abu Dharr (radiy-Allâhu anh) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) said: “Whoever gets away from the (Islamic) congregation by an inch (he) will have taken off the yoke of Islam from his neck.” adab 78; Nesai, katü's-sarik I; Ahmed b.

' He said: 'I swear by the One who sent you with the truth (Prophet) that at that time I will put my sword around my neck (and fight him until he meets you) or until I meet you (for the imam to treat him with justice)'. said.

The situation of the person who rejects (these behaviors contrary to the orders of Allah and His Messenger) is as explained below: Dawud says: The person who rejects Hisham (this sentence) with his tongue is freed (from his responsibilities and hypocrisy) with his heart. The person who rejects it is saved (from participating in the sin of that president), but the person who is satisfied (with that president) and follows (he) has narrated that he has become a partner in his sin. (However, al-Mualla Ibn Ziyad did not narrate the word "one who rejects with his tongue" when he is quoting this sentence). Thereupon (by those present) "O Messenger of Allah, shall we not fight them?" (The Prophet) was asked; No.
4763-) Umm Salam (radiy-Allâhu anhâ) narrated the meaning of the previous hadith. According to this narration, the Prophet (pbuh) said: Those who see (the president's works that do not comply with the religion) ugly will stay away from (responsibility and hypocrisy). The one who rejects is also saved (from having participated in his sin)." (while explaining this sentence), he said: "He who rejects with his heart and sees ugly."
4764-) Arface (radiy-Allâhu anh) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) say: No doubt there will be some strife in the future. Whoever wants to mess up their affairs while the Muslims are in a tidy state, hit anyone with a sword, no matter who they are." Imare 59, 60; Nesai, Tahrim, 6; Ahmed b. Hanbal, IV, 261, 341, V, 24.
4765-) Abide (as-Salmani) (according to what is reported) Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) talked about the Nehravan (the Kharijite, who also set up headquarters) community and said (he said): Among them, there is a man whose arms are very short from birth. If I knew that you would not be spoiled, I would have informed you of the promise Allah made with the tongue of Muhammad (sall-Allâhu 'alaihi wa sallam) for those who fought against them. Did you hear (with your ear) this promise (which Allah really gave) from the Prophet? I said; By the Lord of the Kaaba, he replied, "Yes (I heard it)". Zakat, 155, 156; Ibn Mace, muqaddime 12; hudud, 18 Ahmed, I, 88, 95, 108.

He divided it between one of his sons, Zeydu'l-Hayl, and (first) Amir sons and Alkame Ibn Ulase, one of the sons of Kilab, so the Quraysh and the Ansar (some people) got angry and said: He gives it to the notables of the people of Najd and leaves us. The Prophet said, "I want to warm their hearts to Islam by giving them this ingot." Continuing his narration, Said al-Khudri said: A man Defken (named Harkus Ibn Zuhayr Zülhuvaysıra) with hollow eyes, prominent cheeks, prominent forehead, thick beard (and head) shaved (standing) stood up (and said): O Muhammad Allah! Fear Allah!” (The Prophet said): “If I rebel, who will obey Allah? How can you not trust me when Allah trusts me about the people living on earth?” he commanded. A man who I thought was Khalid Ibn Walid asked permission to kill him. (The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) did not allow it. When that man turned and left, he (our Prophet) said: A nation will arise from the descendants of this man: (That people) who recite the Qur'an (the Qur'an they recite) will not go down their throats. They come out of Islam just as an arrow pierces the prey. (They) leave the pagans and try to kill the Muslims.

4767-) From Abu Said al-Khudri and Anas Ibn Malik (as reported) Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) said: There will be disagreements and divisions in my ummah in the future. A congregation (which will emerge as a result of these divisions) will speak well, but their business will be broken, and those who will read the Qur'an (the Qur'an they recite) will not cross their throats. (They) exit Islam as an arrow pierces the prey, and they will not return (to their religion) until it returns to its place (on the bow). (They are) the worst of Muslims and creatures. Good news to those who killed them or were killed by them. (These evil people mentioned are such people that even if they invite people to the Book of Allah, they do not have anything from that book (in the name of knowledge). (Or they don't have much to do with that book.) Whoever fights them will be closer to Allah than they are." (Then those who were there: O Messenger of Allah, what are their signs?' they asked; It is shaving their hair from the root.” Zakat 149; Ahmed b. Hanbal, II, 197.

When you see them, kill them."
4769-) From Suveyd Ibn Gafala (as reported); Ali (radiyallahu anh) said: When I narrate to you a hadith from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), my fall from the sky would be more beloved to me than to attribute a lie to him. And when I speak to you about matters that have passed between us (which is not the case). Because war is a trick. I heard Rasûlullah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) saying (as follows); In the End Times, a people whose age is young and whose minds do not understand will come. These will speak the most beautiful word of creatures. (But) those who will emerge from Islam as an arrow pierces the prey, and their faith will not pass through their throats (down). Wherever you meet them, kill them. Because killing them is a reward on the Day of Judgment for the one who kills them." istibabe 6; menakib 25; fezailu'l-quran 6; Muslim, zakat 154; Tirmidhi, fitan 24; Ibn Majah, muqaddime 12; Ahmed b.

4770-) Zayd Ibn Wahb al-Juheni (according to) reported; Ali (radiy-Allâhu anh) said: “O people, I heard the Messenger of Allah (sall-Allâhu ’alaihi wa sallam) say (like this): Such a people will emerge from my Ummah that will recite the Qur'an and your reading will (apparently) be nothing compared to theirs. Your prayer will be (apparently) nothing compared to their prayer. Your fast will be nothing compared to their fasting. They will recite the Qur'an in their own favour. However, the Qur'an will be against them, their prayers will not exceed their throats, they will leave Islam as an arrow pierces the prey. If the army that would fight them had known the reward that was determined for them by the tongue of their Prophet (for the war they would wage against them), they would have trusted (they would put all their efforts into it) in this work (to the extent of its value in the sight of Allah). The sign of this nation is that there is a man who has armpits, no arms, and has white hairs on his biceps and a protrusion like nipples on his biceps." (In this case) you (now) leave these people who will be successors to your family and property on your behalf, leaving Muawiya and Damascus. I swear: I hope that (the evil) people (whom the Prophet announced that they will come out) are this people (the people who are in front of us and are called Kharijites), because they spilled the blood that is haram (to spill), and the people spread out on the pasture. My animals usurped. So you walk (on them) with the basmala. Küheyl said: Zayd Ibn Wahb told me the places (where the army was encamped) one by one (and said): Finally, we came to a bridge. Abdullah Ibn Wahb er-Râsibî was at the head of the Kharijites. check. Because I am afraid that they will invite you to peace by swearing (in the name of Allah) as they did on the day of Harura." As a result, only two people from the community (on the side of Hazrat Ali) were killed that day. (They searched but) couldn't find it. Upon this, Hazrat Ali Bizza. He stood up and came to the people who were killed one after the other and said, "Get them out of their places," then they found him among the dead bodies.

4772-) He said from Abu Meryem; That crippled man was poor, but he was with us in the mosque, we used to sit with him day and night. I saw him at the table of Ali Aleyhisselâm with the people among the poor and I had him put on my bathrobe.

When he stood up (at the end of the conversation) we also stood up (with him). After a while (he left us), we saw a Bedouin catch up with him and pull his robe and fry his neck.

(From those present): Messenger of Allah, what is that word? He (the Prophet) asked: Allahumma inni euzu bike minesshaytanirracîm: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the accursed Satan" (this is his word).

Then it descends to the ground; (but) the gates of the earth are also closed before him. Then (since it can't find a place to go) it starts to incline left and right.
