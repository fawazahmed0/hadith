1 | Narrated Mughirah ibn Shu'bah:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) went (outside) to relieve himself, he went to a far-off place.
2 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) felt the need of relieving himself, he went far off where no one could see him.
3 | Abu al-Tayyah reported on the authority of a shaykh (an old man):When Abdullah ibn Abbas came to Basrah, people narrated to him traditions from AbuMusa.  Therefore Ibn Abbas wrote to him asking him about certain things.  In reply AbuMusa wrote to him saying: One day I was in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).  He wanted to urinate.  Then he came to a soft ground at the foot of a wall and urinated.  He (the Prophet) then said: If any of you wants to urinate, he should look for a place (like this) for his urination.
4 | Anas b. Malik reported:When the Apostle of Allaah (sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam) entered the toilet, he used to say (before entering): "O Allaah, I seek refuge in Thee." This is according to the version of Hammad. 'Abd al-Warith has another version :"I seek refuge in Allaah from male and female devils."
5 | Another tradition on the authority of Anas has:" O Allaah, I seek refuge in Thee."   Shu'bah said: Anas sometimes reported the words: "I take refuge in Allah."
6 | Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: These privies are frequented by the jinns and devils.  So when anyone amongst you goes there, he should say: "I seek refuge in Allah from male and female devils."
7 | Narrated Salman al-Farsi:      It was said to Salman: Your Prophet teaches you everything, even about excrement. He replied: Yes. He has forbidden us to face the qiblah at the time of easing or urinating, and cleansing with right hand, and cleansing with less than three stones, or cleansing with dung or bone.
8 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) as saying: I am like father to you. When any of you goes to privy, he should not face or turn his back towards the qiblah. He should not cleanse with his right hand. He (the Prophet, sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) also commanded the Muslims to use three stones and forbade them to use dung or decayed bone.
9 | Narrated Abu Ayyub :That he (the Holy Prophet, sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam) said:"When you go to the privy, neither turn your face nor your back towards the qiblah at the time of excretion or urination, but turn towards the east or the west. (Abu Ayyub said): When we came to Syria, we found that the toilets already built there were facing the qiblah, We turned our faces away from them and begged pardon of Allaah.
10 | Narrated Ma'qil ibn AbuMa'qil al-Asadi:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has forbidden us to face the two qiblahs at the time of urination or excretion.
11 | Marwan al-Asfar said:I saw Ibn Umar make his camel kneel down facing the qiblah, then he sat down urinating in its direction. So I said: AbuAbdurRahman, has this not been forbidden? He replied: Why not, that was forbidden only in open country; but when there is something between you and the qiblah that conceals you , then there is no harm.
12 | Narrated 'Abd Allaah b. 'Umar :I ascended the roof of the house and saw the Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) sitting on two bricks facing Jerusalem (Bait al-Maqdis) for relieving himself.
13 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) forbade us to face the qiblah at the time of making water.  Then I saw him facing it (qiblah) urinating or easing himself one year before his death.
14 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) wanted to relieve himself, he would not raise his garment, until he lowered himself near the ground.   Abu DAwud said: This tradition has been transmitted by 'Abd al-Salam b. Harb on the authority of al-A'mash from Anas b. Malik. This chain of narrators is weak (because A'mash's hearing tradition from Anas b. Malik is not established).
15 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: When two persons go together for relieving themselves uncovering their private parts and talking together, Allah, the Great and Majestic, becomes wrathful at this (action).    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated only by 'Ikrimah b. 'Ammar.
16 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar : A man passed by the Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) while he was urinating, and saluted him. The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) did not return the salutation to him.   Abu Dawud said : It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Umar that the  Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) performed tayammum, then he returned the salutation to the man.
17 | Narrated Muhajir ibn Qunfudh:      Muhajir came to the Prophet (ﷺ) while he was urinating. He saluted him. The Prophet (ﷺ) did not return the salutation to him until he performed ablution. He then apologised to him, saying: I disliked remembering Allah except in the state of purification.
18 | Narrated A'ishah:The Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) used to remember Allaah, the Great and Majestic, at all moments.
19 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) entered the privy, he removed his ring.    Abu Dawud said: This is a munkar tradition, i.e. it contradicts the well-known version reported by reliable narrators. On the authority of Anas the well-known version says: The Prophet (ﷺ) had a silver ring made for him. Then he cast it off. The misunderstanding is on the part of Hammam (who is the narrator of the previous tradition mentioned in the text). This is transmitted only by Hammam.
20 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas : The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) passed by two graves. He said : Both (the dead) are being punished, but they are not being punished for a major (sin). One did not safeguard himself from urine. The other carried tales. He then called for a fresh twig and split it into two parts  and planted one part on each grave and said: Perhaps their punishment may be mitigated as long as the twigs remain fresh.   Another version of Hannad has: "One of them did not cover himself while urinating." This version does not have the words: "He did not safeguard himself from urine."
21 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: A tradition from the Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) conveying  similar meaning.    The version of Jarir has the wording : "he did not cover himself while urinating."   The version of Abu Mu'awiyah has the wording: "he did not safeguard himself (from urine)."
22 | Narrated Amr ibn al-'As:      AbdurRahman ibn Hasanah reported: I and Amr ibn al-'As went to the Prophet (ﷺ). He came out with a leather shield (in his hand). He covered himself with it and urinated. Then we said: Look at him. He is urinating as a woman does. The Prophet (ﷺ), heard this and said: Do you not know what befell a person from amongst Banu Isra'il (the children of Israel)? When urine fell on them, they would cut off the place where the urine fell;  but he (that person) forbade them (to do so), and was punished in his grave.    Abu Dawud said: One version of Abu Musa has the wording: "he cut off his skin".   Another version of Abu Musa goes: "he cut off (part of) his body."
23 | Narrated Hudhaifah : The Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) came to a midden of some people and urinated while standing. He then asked for water and wiped his shoes.   Abu Dawud said: Musaddad, a narrator, reported: I went far away from him. He then called me and I reached just near his heals.
24 | Narrated Umaymah daughter of Ruqayqah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) had a wooden vessel under his bed in which he would urinate at night.
25 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) as saying : Be on your guard against two things which provoke cursing. They (the hearers) said : Prophet of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam), what are these things which provoke cursing: easing in the watering places and on the thoroughfares, and in the shade (of the tree)(where they take shelter and rest).
26 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Be on your guard against three things which provoke cursing: easing in the watering places and on the thoroughfares, and in the shade (of the tree).
27 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mughaffal:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No one of you should make water in his bath and then wash himself there (after urination).       The version of Ahmad has: Then performs ablution there, for evil thoughts come from it.
28 | Narrated A Man from the Companions:      Humayd al-Himyari said: I met a man (Companion of the Prophet) who remained in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) just as AbuHurayrah remained in his company. He then added: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade that anyone amongst us should comb (his hair) every day or urinate in the place where he takes a bath.
29 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Sarjis:      The Prophet (ﷺ) prohibited to urinate in a hole.    Qatadah (a narrator) was asked about the reason for the disapproval of urinating in a hole. He replied: It is said that these (holes) are the habitats of the jinn.
30 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) came out of the privy, he used to say: "Grant me Thy forgiveness."
31 | Narrated Abu Qatadah:The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: When any one of you urinates, he must not touch his penis with his right hand,  and when he goes to relieve himself he must not wipe himself with his right hand (in the privy), and when he drinks, he must not drink in one breath.
32 | Narrated Hafsah, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used his right hand for taking his food and drink and used his left hand for other purposes.
33 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used his right hand for getting water for ablution and taking food, and his left hand for his evacuation and for anything repugnant.
34 | Aishah, also reported a tradition bearing similar meaning through another chain of transmitters.
35 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone applies collyrium, he should do it an odd number of times. If he does so, he has done well; but if not, there is no harm. If anyone cleanses himself with pebbles, he should use an odd number. If he does so, he has done well; but if not, there is no harm.       If anyone eats, he should throw away what he removes with a toothpick and swallow what sticks to his tongue. If he does so, he has done well; if not, there is no harm. If anyone goes to relieve himself, he should conceal himself, and if all he can do is to collect a heap of send, he should sit with his back to it, for the devil makes sport with the posteriors of the children of Adam. If he does so, he has done well; but if not, there is no harm.
36 | Narrated Ruwayfi' ibn Thabit:      Shayban al-Qatbani reported that Maslamah ibn Mukhallad made Ruwayfi' ibn Thabit the governor of the lower parts (of Egypt). He added: We travelled with him from Kum Sharik to Alqamah or from Alqamah to Kum Sharik (the narrator doubts) for Alqam.       Ruwayfi' said: Any one of us would borrow a camel during the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ) from the other, on condition that he would give him half the booty, and the other half he would retain himself.       Further, one of us received an arrowhead and a feather, and the other an arrow-shaft as a share from the booty.       He then reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You may live for a long time after I am gone, Ruwayfi', so, tell people that if anyone ties his beard or wears round his neck a string to ward off the evil eye, or cleanses himself with animal dung or bone, Muhammad has nothing to do with him.
37 | This tradition has also been narrated by Abu Salim al-Jaishani on the authority of 'Abd Allaah b. 'Amr. He narrated this tradition at the time when he besieged the fort  at the gate of Alyun.   Abu Dawud said:The fort of Alyun lies at the mountain in Fustat. Abu Dawud said: The kunyah (surname) of Shaiban b. Umayyah is Abu Hudhaifah.
38 | Narrated Jabir b. 'Abd Allaah:The Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) forbade us to use a bone or dung for wiping.
39 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      A deputation of the jinn came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: O Muhammad, forbid your community to cleans themselves with a bone or dung or charcoal, for in them Allah has provided sustenance for us.  So the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade them to do so.
40 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: When any of you goes to relieve himself, he should take with him three stones to cleans himself, for they will be enough for him.
41 | Narrated Khuzaymah ibn Thabit:      The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about cleansing (after relieving oneself). He said: (One should cleanse oneself) with three stones which should be free from dung.   Abu Dawud said: A similar tradition has been narrated by Abu Usamah and Ibn Numair from Hisham.
42 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) urinated and Umar was standing behind him with a jug of water. He said: What is this, Umar? He replied: Water for you to perform ablution with. He said: I have not been commanded to perform ablution every time I urinate. If I were to do so, it would become a sunnah.
43 | Narrated Anas b. Malik :The Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) entered a park. He was accompanied by a boy who had a jug of water with him. He was the youngest of us. He placed it near the lote-tree. He ( the Prophet, sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) relieved himself. He came to us after he had cleansed himself with water.
44 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The following verse was revealed in connection with the people of Quba': "In it are men who love to be purified" (ix.108). He (AbuHurayrah) said: They used to cleanse themselves with water after easing. So the verse was revealed in connection with them.
45 | Narrated Abu Hurayrah : When the Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) went to the privy, I took to him water in a small vessel  or a skin, and he cleansed himself. He then wiped his hand on the ground. I then took to him another vessel  and he performed ablution.   Abu Dawud said : The tradition is transmitted by al-Aswad b. 'Amir is more perfect.
46 | Narrated Abu Hurayrah :(the Prophet, sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) as saying : Were it not that I might oeverburdern the believers, I would order them to delay the night ('isha ) prayer and use the tooth-stick at the time of every prayer.
47 | Narrated Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Were it not hard on my ummah, I would order them to use the tooth-stick at the time of every prayer. AbuSalamah said: Zayd ibn Khalid used to attend the prayers in the mosque with his tooth-stick on his ear where a clerk carries a pen, and whenever he got up for prayer he used it.
48 | Narrated Abdullah b. 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar:      Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Habban asked Abdullah ibn Abdullah ibn Umar about the reason for Ibn Umar's performing ablution for every prayer, whether he was with or without ablution.       He replied: Asma', daughter of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, reported to me that Abdullah ibn Hanzalah ibn AbuAmir narrated to her that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was earlier commanded to perform ablution for every prayer whether or not he was with ablution.       When it became a burden for him, he was ordered to use tooth-stick for every prayer. As Ibn Umar thought that he had the strength (to perform the ablution for every prayer), he did not give up performing ablution for every prayer.    Abu Dawud said: Ibrahim b. Sa'd narrated this tradition on the authority of Muhammad b. Ishaq, and there he mentions the name of 'Ubaid Allah b. 'Abd Allah (instead of 'Abd Allah b. 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar)
49 | Narrated Abu Burdah: On the authority of his father ( Abu Musa al-Ash'ari), reported (according to the version of Musaddad) : We came to the Apostle of Allaah (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) to provide us with a mount, and found him using the tooth-stick, its one end being at his tongue (i.e. he wsa rinsing his mouth).   According to the version of Sulaiman it goes : I entered upon the Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) who was using the tooth-stick, and had it placed at one side of his tongue, producing a gurgling sound.   Abu Dawud said : Musaddad said that the tradition was a lengthy but he shortened it.
50 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was using the tooth-stick, when two men, one older than the other, were with him. A revelation came to him about the merit of using the tooth-stick. He was asked to show proper respect and give it to the elder of the two.
51 | Shuraih asked 'Aishah:"What would the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do as soon as he entered the house?" She replied: "(He would use) the siwak."
52 | 'Aishah narrated:"The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) would clean his teeth with the Siwak, then he would give me the Siwak in order to wash it. So I would first use it myself, then wash it and return it.
53 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Ten are the acts according to fitrah (nature): clipping the moustache, letting the beard grow, using the tooth-stick, cleansing the nose (Al-Istinshaq) with water, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the arm-pits, shaving the pubes, and cleansing one's private parts (after easing or urinating) with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth.
54 | Narrated Ammar b. Yasir: The Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) said : The rinsing of mouth and snuffing up water in the nose are acts that bear the characteristics of fitrah (nature). He then narrated a similar tradition (as reported by Aishah), but he did not mention the words "letting the beard grow". He added the words "circumcision" and "sprinkling  water on the private part of the body". He did not mention the words "cleansing oneself after easing".   Abu Dawud said : A similar tradition has been reported on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas. He mentioned only five sunnahs all relating to the head, one of them being parting of the hair; it did not include wearing the beard.   Abu Dawud said: The tradition as reported by Hammad has also been transmitted by Talq b. Habib , Mujahid, and Bakr b. 'Abd Allaah b. al-Muzani as their own statement ( not as a tradition from the Prophet, sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ).They did not mention the words "letting the beard grow". The version transmitted by Muhammad b. Abd Allaah b. Abi Maryam, Abu Salamah, and Abu Hurairah from the Prophet ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) mentions the words "letting the beard grow". A similar tradition has been reported by Ibrahim al-Nakha'i. He mentioned the words "wearing the beard and circumcision."

58 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: I spent a night with the Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam). When he woke up from his sleep (in the latter part of the night for prayer) he came to his ablution water. He took the tooth-stick and used it. He then recited the verse: "Verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are tokens (of His Sovereignty) for men of understanding" (iii-190). He recited these verses up to the end of the chapter or he finished the whole chapter. He then performed  ablution and  came to the place of prayer. He then said two rak'ahs of prayer. He then lay down on the bed and slept as much as Allaah wished. He then got up and did the same. He then lay down and slept. He then got up and did the same. Every time he used the tooth-stick and offered two rak'ah of prayer. He then offered the prayer known as witr.   Abu Dawud said: Fudail on the authority if Husain reported the wording: He then used the tooth-stick and performed ablution while he was reciting the verses: "Verily in the creation of the heaves and the earth..." until he finished the chapter.
59 | Narrated AbulMalih:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Allah does not accept charity from goods acquired by embezzlement as He does not accept prayer without purification.
60 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) said : Allaah, the Exalted, does not accept the prayer of any of you when you are defiled until you performed ablution.

62 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      AbuGhutayf al-Hudhali reported: I was in the company of Ibn Umar. When the call was made for the noon (zuhr) prayer, he performed ablution and said the prayer. When the call for the afternoon ('asr) prayer was made, he again performed ablution. Thus I asked him (about the reason of performing ablution). He replied: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: For a man who performs ablution in a state of purity, ten virtuous deeds will be recorded (in his favour).       AbuDawud said: This is the tradition narrated by Musaddad, and it is more perfect.
63 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Prophet (ﷺ), was asked about water (in desert country) and what is frequented by animals and wild beasts. He replied: When there is enough water to fill two pitchers, it bears no impurity.
64 | Narrated 'Abd Allaah b. 'Umar:The Messenger of Allaah (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked about water in desert. He then narrated a similar tradition (as mentioned above).
65 | Narrated 'Abdullah b. 'Umar: The Apostle of Allaah ( sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) said: When there is enough water to fill two pitchers, it does not become impure.   Abu Dawud said : Hammad b. Zaid has narrated this tradition on the authority of 'Asim ( without any reference to the Prophet)
66 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The people asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Can we perform ablution out of the well of Buda'ah, which is a well into which menstrual clothes, dead dogs and stinking things were thrown? He replied: Water is pure and is not defiled by anything.
67 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ): Water is brought for you from the well of Buda'ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything.   Abu Dawud said I heard Qutaibah b. Sa'id say: I asked the person in charge of the well of Bud'ah about the depth of the well. He replied: At most the water reaches pubes. Then I asked: Where does it reach when its level goes down ? He replied: Below the private part of the body.   Abu Dawud said: I measured the breadth of the well of Buda'ah with my sheet which I stretched over it. I them measured it with the hand. It measured six cubits in breadth. I then asked the man who opened the door of garden for me and admitted me to it: Has the condition of this well changed from what it had originally been in the past ? He replied: No. I saw the color of water in this well had changed.
68 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      One of the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) took a bath from a large bowl. The Prophet (ﷺ) wanted to perform ablution or take from the water left over. She said to him: O Prophet of Allah, verily I was sexually defiled. The Prophet said: Water not defiled.

72 | A similar tradition has been transmitted by Abu Hurairah through a different chain of narrators. But this version has been narrated as a statement of Abu Hurairah himself and not attributed to the Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ). The version has the addition of the words :"If the cat licks (a utensil), it should be washed once."
73 | Narrated Abu Hurairah : The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying : When a dog licks a (thing contained in a) utensil you must wash it seven times, using earth (sand) for the seventh time.   Abu Dawud said : This tradition has been transmitted by another chain of narrators in which there is no mention of earth.
74 | Narrated Ibn Mughaffal: The Messenger of Allaah (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) ordered the killing of the dogs, and then said: Why are they (people) after them (dogs)? and then granted permission (to keep) for hunting  and for (the security) of the herd, and said : When the dog licks the utensil wash it seven times, and rub it with earth the eighth time.   Abu Dawud said : Ibn Mughaffal narrated in a similar way.
75 | Narrated AbuQatadah:      Kabshah, daughter of Ka'b ibn Malik and wife of Ibn AbuQatadah, reported: AbuQatadah visited (me) and I poured out water for him for ablution. A cat came and drank some of it and he tilted the vessel for it until it drank some of it. Kabshah said: He saw me looking at him; he asked me: Are you surprised, my niece? I said: Yes.

84 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      AbuZayd quoted Abdullah ibn Mas'ud as saying that on the night when the jinn listened to the Qur'an the Prophet (ﷺ) said: What is in your skin vessel? He said: I have some nabidh. He (the Holy Prophet) said: It consists of fresh dates and pure water.

90 | Narrated Thawban:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Three things one is not allowed to do: supplicating Allah specifically for himself and ignoring others while leading people in prayer; if he did so, he deceived them; looking inside a house before taking permission: if he did so, it is as if he entered the house, saying prayer while one is feeling the call of nature until one eases oneself.
91 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: It is not permissible for a man who believes in Allah and in the Last Day that he should say the prayer while he is feeling the call of nature until he becomes light (by relieving himself).

Yazid transmitted a similar tradition with the following wordings: "It is not permissible for a man who believes in Allah and in the Last Day that he should lead the people in prayer but with their permission; and that he should not supplicate to Allah exclusively for himself leaving all others.

But this chain mentions Ibn Jabr b. ‘Atik instead of ‘ Abd Allah b. Jabr.    Abu Dawud Said : This tradition has also been narrated by Sufyan from ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Isa. This chain mentions the name Jabr b. ‘Abd Allah instead of ‘Abd Allah b. Jabr.   Abu Dawud Said : I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say : one sa’ measures five rotls.

Hammad said: I do not know whether the phrase "the ears are treated as part of the head" was he statement of the Prophet (ﷺ) or of Abu Umamah.
135 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked him: Messenger of Allah, how is the ablution (to performed)?

It was then prepared. A tray containing dates was then presented to us. (The narrator Qutaybah did not mention the word qina', tray).       Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came. He asked: Has anything been served to you or ordered for you?  We replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. While we were sitting in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) we suddenly saw that a shepherd was driving a herd of sheep to their fold. He had with him a newly-born lamb that was crying.       He (the Prophet) asked him: What did it bear, O so and so? He replied: A ewe. He then said: Slaughter for us in its place a sheep. Do not think that we are slaughtering it for you. We have one hundred sheep and we do not want their number to increase. Whenever a ewe is born, we slaughter a sheep in its place.       (The narrator says that the Prophet (ﷺ) used the word la tahsabanna, do not think).       I (the narrator Laqit) then said: Messenger of Allah, I have a wife who has something (wrong) in her tongue, i.e. she is insolent. He said: Then divorce her. I said: Messenger of Allah, she had company with me and I have children from her. He said: Then ask her (to obey you). If there is something good in her, she will do so (obey); and do not beat your wife as you beat your slave-girl.       I said: Messenger of Allah, tell me about ablution. He said: Perform ablution in full and make the fingers go through the beard and snuff with water well except when you are fasting.

He abandoned the main road before the dawn prayer, and I also did the same along with him. The Prophet (ﷺ) made his camel kneel down and (went to ) relieve himself. He then came back and I poured water upon his hands from the skin-vessel. He then washed his hands and face. He tried to get his forearms out (of the gown), but the sleeves of the gown were too narrow, so he entered back both his hands, and brought them out from beneath the gown. He washed his forearms up to the elbows and wiped his head and wiped over his socks.80 He then mounted (his camel) and we began to proceed until we found people  offering the prayer. They brought forward ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awf who was leading them in prayer. The Prophet(ﷺ) stood in the row side by side with other Muslims. He performed the second rak’ah of the prayer behind ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awf. Then ‘Abd al-Rahman uttered salutation. The Prophet(ﷺ) stood to perform the remaining rak’ah of the prayer. The Muslims were alarmed. They began to utter tasbih (Subhan Allah) presuming that they had offered prayer before the Prophet (ﷺ) had done. When he uttered the salutation (i.e. finished his prayer), he said: You were right, or (he said) you did well.
150 | Al-Mughirah b. Shu’bah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed ablution and wiped his forelock and turban. Another version says : The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped his socks and his forelock and his turban.    Bakr said: I heard it from Ibn al-Mughirah.

I came to him with the jug of water and poured upon him. He washed his hands and face. He had a tight-sleeved Syrian woolen gown. He tried to get his forearms out, but the sleeve of the gown was very narrow, so he brought his hands out from under the gown. I then bent down to take off his socks. But he said to me : Leave them, for my feet were clean when I put them in, and he only wiped over them.    Yunus said on the authority of al-Sha’bi that ‘Urwah narrated his tradition from his father before him, and his father reported it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
152 | Al-Mughirah b. Shu’bah said :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lagged behind (in a journey). He then narrated this story saying : Then we came to people. ‘Abd al-Rahman was leading them in the dawn prayer. When he perceived the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ), he intended to retire. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him to continue and I and the Prophet (ﷺ)offered one rak’ah of prayer behind him. When he had pronounced the salutation, the Prophet(ﷺ) got up and offered the rak’ah which had been finished before, and he made no addition to it.    Abu Dawud said: Abu Sa’id al-Khudri, Ibn al-Zubair and Ibn ‘Umar hold the opinion that whoever gets an odd number of the rak’ahs of prayer, he should perform two prostrations on account of forgetfulness.
153 | Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami said that he witnessed ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awf asking Bilal about the ablution of the Prophet (ﷺ). Bilal said:He went out to relieve himself. Then I brought water for him and he performed ablution, and wiped over his turban and socks.
154 | Abu Zur’ah b. ‘Amr b. Jarir said :Jarir urinated. He then performed ablution and wiped over the socks.

He replied: For two days too. He again asked: And for three days? He replied: Yes, as long as you wish.    Abu Dawud said: Another version says: He asked him about the period until he reached the period of seven days. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied: Yes, as long as you wish (i.e. there is no time limit).   Abu Dawud said: There is a variance in the chain of narrators of this tradition. The chain is not strong.   Another chain from Yahya b. Ayyub is also disputed.
159 | Narrated Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed ablution and wiped over the stockings and shoes.    Abu Dawud said: 'Abd al-Rahman b. Mahdi did not narrate this tradition because the familiar version from al-Mughirah says that the Prophet (ﷺ) wiped over the socks.   Abu Musa al-Ash'ari has also reported: The Prophet (ﷺ) wiped over stockings. But the chain of narrators of this tradition is neither continous nor strong.   'Ali b. Abi Talib, Ibn Mas'ud, al-Bara' b. 'Aziz, Anas b. Malik, Abu Umamah, Sahl b. Sa'd and 'Amr b. Huriath also wiped over the stockings.

Abbad (a sub-narrator) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to the well of a people. Musaddad did not mention the words Midat (a place where ablution is performed), and Kazamah (well). Then both agreed on the wording:"He performed ablution and wiped over his shoes and feet."

162 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      If the religion were based on opinion, it would be more important to wipe the under part of the shoe than the upper but I have seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiping over the upper part of his shoes.
163 | This tradition has been transmitted through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:“I always preferred to wash the under part of the feet until I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiping the upper part of them.
164 | A ‘mash transmitted this tradition saying:If religion were based on opinion, it would be more proper to wipe the under part of the feet than the upper. The Prophet (ﷺ) wiped over the upper part of his shoes.

165 | Narrated Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah:      I poured water while the Prophet (ﷺ)  performed ablution in the battle of Tabuk. He wiped over the upper part of the socks and their lower part.   Abu Dawud said: I have been told that Thawr did not hear this tradition from Raja'.

I found the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressing the people. I heard him say: Anyone amongst you who performs ablution, and does it well, then he stands and offers two rak’ahs of prayer, concentrating on it with his heart and body, Paradise will be his lot by all means. I said: Ha-ha! How fine it is! A man in front of me said: The action (mentioned by the Prophet) earlier, O ‘Uqbah, is finer that this one. I looked at him and found him to be ‘Umar b. al-Khattab. I asked him: What is that, O Abu Hafs? He replied: He (the Prophet) had said before you came: If any one of you performs ablution, and does it well, and when he finishes the ablution, he utters the words : I bear witness that there is no deity except Allah, He has no associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His Servant and His Messenger, all the eight doors of Paradise will be opened for him; he may enter (through) any of them.    Mu’awiyah said: Rabi’ah b. Yazid narrated this tradition to me from Abu Idris and the authority of  ‘Uqbah b.’Amir.
170 | ‘Uqbah b. ‘Amir al-JuhanI narrated this tradition from the Prophet(ﷺ) in a similar way. He did not mention about tending the camels.

Another version adds the wording : “ Go back and perform the ablution well.”
174 | Hasan narrated from the Prophet (ﷺ) a tradition conveying the same meaning as that of Qatadah.
175 | Narrated Some Companions of the Prophet:      The Prophet (ﷺ) saw a person offering prayer, and on the back of his foot a small part equal to the space of a dirham remained unwashed; the water did not reach it. The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded him to repeat the ablution and prayer.
176 | 'Abbad b. Tamim reported from his uncle that a person made a complaint to the Prophet (ﷺ) that he entertained (doubt) as if something had happened to him which had rendered his ablution invalid. He (the Prophet) said:He should not cease (to pray) unless he hears a sound or perceives a smell (of passing wind).
177 | Abu Hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If any one of you offers prayer and feels a movement between his paddocks, but is doubtful whether or not his ablution broke, he should not cease praying unless he hears a sound or perceives a smell.
178 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) kissed me and did not perform ablution.

Yahya said: Narrate from me that both these traditions are weak in respect of their chains.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Thawri is reported to have said: Habib narrated this tradition to us only on the authority of 'Urwat al-Muzani, that is, he did not narrated any tradition on the authority of 'Urwah b. al-Zubair.   Abu Dawud said: Hamzah al-Zayyat reported a sound tradition on the authority of Habib, from 'Urwah b. al-Zubair from 'Aishah.

He replied: You may offer prayer in such places; these are the places of blessing.
185 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by a boy who was skinning a goat. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Give it up until I show you.

In the meantime Bilal came and called him for prayer. He came out and passed by a person who had his fire-pan on the fire. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: Has the food in the fire-pan been cooked?  He replied: Yes, my parents be sacrificed upon you. He then took a piece out of it and continued to chew it until he uttered the first takbir (AllahuAkbar)  of the prayer. All this time I was looking at him.

He (the husband of the woman killed) took an oath saying: I shall not rest until I kill one of the companions of Muhammad.        He went out following the footsteps of the Prophet (ﷺ). The Prophet (ﷺ) encamped at a certain place.  He said: Who will keep a watch on us? A person from the Muhajirun (Emigrants) and another from the Ansar (Helpers) responded.  He said: Go to the mouth of the mountain-pass. When they went to the mouth of the mountain-pass the man from the Muhajirun lay down while the man from the Ansar stood praying.        The man (enemy) came to them. When he saw the person he realised that he was the watchman of the Muslims. He shot him with an arrow and hit the target. But he (took the arrow out and) threw it away. He (the enemy) then shot three arrows. Then he (the Muslim) bowed and prostrated and awoke his companion. When he (the enemy) perceived that they (the Muslims) had become aware of his presence, he ran away.        When the man from the Muhajirun saw the (man from the Ansar) bleeding, he asked him: Glory be to Allah! Why did you not wake me up  the first time when he shot at you.

202 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to prostrate and sleep (in prostration) and produce puffing sounds (during sleep). Then he would stand and pray and would not perform ablution. I said to him: you prayed but did not perform ablution though you slept (in prostration). He replied: Ablution is necessary for one who sleeps while he is lying down. Uthman and Hannad added: For when he lies down, his joints are relaxed.    Abu Dawud said: The statement "ablution is necessary for one who sleeps while one is lying down" is a munkar (rejected) tradition. It has been narrated only by Yazid Abu Khalid al-Dalani, on the authority of Qatadah. And its earlier part has been narrated by a group (of narrators) from Ibn 'Abbas; they did not mention anything about it. He (Ibn 'Abbas) said: The Prophet (ﷺ) was protected (during his sleep). 'Aishah reported: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: My eyes sleep, but my heart does not sleep. Shu'bah said: Qatadah heard from Abu'l-'Aliyah only four traditions: the tradition about Jonah son of Matthew, the tradition reported by Ibn 'Umar about prayer, the tradition stating that the judges are three, and the tradition narrated by Ibn 'Abbas saying: (This tradition) has been narrated to me by reliable persons ; 'Umar is one of them, and the most reliable of them in my opinion is 'Umar. Abu Dawud said: I asked Ahmad b. Hanbal about the tradition narrated by Yazid al-Dalani. He rebuked me out of respect for him. Then he said: Yazid al-Dalani does not add anything to what has been narrated by the teachers of Qatadah. He did not care of this tradition (due to its weakness).

204 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      We would not wash our feet after treading on something unclean, nor would we hold our hair and garments (during prayer).   Abu Dawud said: The tradition has been reported by Ibrahim b. Abi Mu'awiyah through a different chain of narrators: A'mash - Shaqiq - Masruq - 'Abd Allah (b. Mas'ud). And Hannad reported from Shaqiq, or reported on his authority saying: 'Abd Allah (b. Mas'ud) said.
205 | Narrated Ali ibn Talq:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: When any of you breaks wind during the prayer, he should turn away and perform ablution and repeat the prayer.
206 | ‘Ali said:My prostatic fluid flowed excessively. I used to take a bath until my back cracked (because of frequent washing). I mentioned it to the prophet (May peace be upon him), or the fact was mentioned to him (by someone else). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said; Do not do so. When you find prostatic fluid, wash your penis and perform ablution as you do for your prayer, but when you have seminal emission, you should take a bath.
207 | Narrated Al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad:      Ali ibn AbuTalib commanded him to ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  what a man should do when he wants to have intercourse with his wife and the prostatic fluid comes out (at this moment). (He said): I am ashamed of consulting him because of the position of his daughter. Al-Miqdad said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it.  He said: When any of you finds, he should wash his private part, and perform ablution as he does for prayer.
208 | ‘Urwah said :‘Ali b abi Talib said to al-miqdad, and made a similar statement as above. Al-Miqdad asked him (the prophet). The prophet (peace be upon him) said: he should wash his penis and testicles.   Abu Dawud said : The tradition has been narrators by al-Thawri and a group of narrators from Hisham on the authority of his father from al-Miqdad, from ‘Ali reporting from the prophet (May peace be upon him).
209 | ‘Urwah reported on the Authority of his father a tradition from ‘Ali b. Abi Talib who said :I Asked al-Miqdad (to consult the prophet). He then narrated the tradition bearing the same meaning.   Abu Dawud said; this tradition has been reported with another chain of narrators. This version does not mention the word “testicles”.
210 | Narrated Sahl ibn Hunayf:      I felt greatly distressed by the frequent flowing of prostatic fluid. For this reason I used to take a bath very often. I asked the apostle of Allah (ﷺ) about this. He replied: Ablution will be sufficient for you because of this. I asked: Messenger of Allah, what should I do if it smears my clothes. He replied: It is sufficient if you take a handful of water  and sprinkle it on your clothe when you find it has smeared it.
211 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Sa'd al-Ansari:      I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as to what makes it necessary to take a bath and about the (prostatic) fluid that flows after taking a bath. He replied: that is called madhi (prostatic fluid). It flows from every male. You should wash your private parts and testicles because of it and perform ablution as you do for prayer.
212 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Sa'd al-Ansari:      Abdullah asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): What is lawful for me to do with my wife when she is menstruating? He replied: What is above the waist-wrapper is lawful for you.        The narrator also mentioned (the lawfulness of) eating with a woman in menstruation, and he transmitted the tradition in full.
213 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): What is lawful for a man to do with his wife when she is menstruating? He replied: What is above the waist-wrapper, but it is better to abstain from it, too.    Abu Dawud said: This (tradition) is not strong.
214 | Ubayy b. Ka’b reported :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) made a concession in the early days of Islam on account of the paucity of clothes that one should not take a bath if one has sexual intercourse (and has no seminal emission). But later on her commanded to take a bath in such a case and prohibited its omission.
215 | Ubayy b. Ka’b said :The verdict that water (bath) is necessary when there is emission given by the people (in the early days of Islam) was due to the concession granted by the Messenger of Allah in the beginning of Islam. He then commanded to take a bath (in such a case).   Abu Dawud said : By Abu Ghassan is meant Muhammad b. mutarrif.
216 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (May peace be upon him) as saying :when anyone sits between the four parts of a woman and the parts (of the male and female) which are circumscised join together, then bath becomes obligatory.
217 | Aba Sa’id al-Khudri reported :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said : water (bath) is necessary only when there is seminal emission. And Abu Salamah followed it.

219 | Narrated AbuRafi':      One day the Prophet (ﷺ) had intercourse with all his wives. He took a bath after each intercourse. I asked him: Messenger of Allah, why don't you make it a single bath?

220 | Abu sa’id al-Khudri reported :The Prophet (May peace be upon him) said : When any of you has intercourse with his wife and desire to repeat it, he should perform ablution between them.
221 | ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar reported :‘Umar b. al-Khattab said to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) that he became sexually defiled at night (asking him what he should do). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said : You should perform ablution and wash your penis and then sleep.
222 | ‘A’ishah reported:when the prophet (ﷺ) intended to sleep while he was sexually defiled, he would perform ablution as he did for prayer.
223 | This Tradition has been narrated on the Authority of al-Zuhri through a different chain. It adds :If he intends to eat while he is defiled, he should wash both his hands.   Abu Dawud said: Ibn Wahb narrated this tradition on the authority of  Yunus. He described the fact of eating as the statement of ‘A’ishah (not the saying of the prophet). It has also been narrated it from ‘Urwah or Abu Salamah. Al-Awza’I narrated it from Yunus on the Authority of Al-Zuhri from the prophet (ﷺ) as narrated by Ibn al-Mubarak.
224 | ‘A’ishah reported :When the Prophet (May peace be upon him) wanted to eat or sleep, he would perform ablution. She meant that (the prophet did so) when he was sexually defiled.

She replied: Sometimes he would take a bath at the beginning of the night and sometimes at the end.        Thereupon I exclaimed: Allah is most Great. All Praise be to Allah Who made this matter accommodative.        I again asked her: What do you think, did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say the witr prayer (additional prayer after obligatory prayer at night) in the beginning of the night or at the end?        She replied: Sometimes he would say the witr prayer at the beginning of the night and sometimes at the end.        I exclaimed: Allah is most Great. All praise be to Allah Who made the matter accommodative.        Again I asked her: What do you think, did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recite the Qur'an (in the prayer) loudly or softly?        She replied: Sometimes he would recite loudly and sometimes softly.        I exclaimed: Allah is most Great. All praise be to Allah Who made the matter flexible.

229 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      Abdullah ibn Salamah said: I, accompanied by other two persons, one from us and the other from Banu Asad, called upon Ali. He sent them to a certain territory (on some mission) saying: You are sturdy and vigorous people; hence display your power for religion. He then stood and entered the toilet. He then came out and called for water and took a handful of it. Then he wiped (his hands) with it and began to recite the Qur'an. They were surprised at this (action).        Thereupon he said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out from the privy and taught us the Qur'an and took meat  with us. Nothing prevented him; or the narrator said: Nothing prevented him from (reciting) the Qur'an except sexual defilement.
230 | Hudhaifah reported :The prophet (ﷺ) visited him and inclined towards him (for shaking hand). He said : I am sexually defiled. The prophet (ﷺ) replied : A muslim is not defiled.
231 | Abu Hudhaifah reported :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) met me on one of the streets of medina while I was sexually defiled. I retreated and went away. I then took a bath and came to him. He asked : Where were you, O Abu Hurairah? I replied : As I was sexually defiled, I disliked to sit in your company without purification. He exclaimed: Glory be to Allah! A Muslim is not defiled.   He (Abu Dawud) said : The version of this tradition reported by Bishr has the chain: Humaid reported from Bakr.
232 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and saw that the doors of the houses of his Companions were facing the mosque.

The Prophet (ﷺ) then entered (the houses or the mosque), and the people did take any step in this regard hoping that some concession might be revealed. He the Prophet) again came upon them and said: Turn the direction of these (doors) from the mosque I do not make the mosque lawful for a menstruating woman and for a person who is sexually defiled.    Abu Dawud said: Aflat b. Khalifah is also called Fulait al-'Amiri.
233 | Narrated AbuBakrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to lead (the people) in the dawn prayer. He then signalled with his hand: (Stay) at your places. (Then he entered his home). He then returned while drops of water were coming down from him (from his body) and he led them in prayer.
234 | This tradition has been reported by Hammad b. Salamah through the same chain of narrators and conveying a similar meaning. This version adds in the beginning:He uttered TAKBIR (Allahu akbar), and in the end : when he finished the prayer, he said : I am a human being; I was sexually defiled.   Abu Dawud said : This tradition has been narrated al-Zuhri from Abu Salamah b. ‘Abd al-Rahman on the authority of Abu Hurairah. It says: When he stood at the place of prayer, we waited for his utterance of takbir (Allah-u akbar).He went away and said : (remain) as you were.   Another version on the authority of Muhammad reporting  from the Prophet (ﷺ) says: He uttered takbir (Allah-u-Akbar) and then made a sign to the people, meaning "sit down". He then went away and took a bath. This tradition has also been narrated through a different chain. It says: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) uttered takbir (Allah-u-akbar) in a prayer.   Abu Dawud said: Another version through a different chain says; The Prophet (May peace be upon him) uttered takbir (Allah-u akbar).
235 | Abu Hurairah reported:The prayer (in congregation) began and people stood in their rows. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) came out (from his residence). When he stood at his proper place he recalled that he did not take a bath. He then said to the people: (Remain standing) at your places. Then he returned to his house and came out upon us after taking a bath while the drops of water were coming down from his head. We were standing in the rows (of prayer). This is the version of Ibn Harb. ‘Ayyash reported in his version: we kept on waiting for him while we were standing until he came upon us after he had taken a bath.
236 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about a person who found moisture (on his body or clothes) but did not remember the sexual dream. He replied: He should take a bath. He was asked about a person who remembered that he had a sexual dream but did not find moisture. He replied: Bath is not necessary for him. Umm Salamah then asked: Is washing necessary for a woman if she sees that (in her dream)? He replied: Yes. Woman are counterpart of men.
237 | ‘A’ishah reported on the authority of Umm Sulaim al-Ansariyah, who was the mother of Anas b. Malik, said:Messenger of Allah. Allah is not ashamed of truth what do you think, if a woman sees what a man sees in dream, should she take a bath or not? The prophet (ﷺ) replied: Yes, she should take a bath if she finds the liquid (vaginal secretion) ‘A’ishah said : Then I came upon her and said her : Woe to you! Does a woman see that (sexual dream)? In the meantime, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came upon me and said: May your right hand be covered with dust! How can there be the resemblance (i.e., between the child and the mother)?   Abu Dawud said: A similar version has been narrated by Zubaid, ‘Uqail, Yunus, cousin of Al-Zuhri, Ibn Abi-Wazir, on the authority of al-Zuhr, musan, al-Hajabi, like al-Zuhri, narrated on the authority of ‘Urwah from ‘A’ishah, but  Hisham b. ‘Urwah narrated from ‘Urwah on the authority of Zainab daughter of Abu Salamah from Umm Salamah saying. Umm Sulaim came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
238 | 'Aishah said:The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) used to take bath with from a vessel (which contained seven to eight seers, i.e., fifteen to sixteen pounds) because of sexual intercourse.   Abu Dawud said: The version narrated by Mu’ammar on the authority of al-Zuhri has: She (‘A’ishah) said: I and the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) took a bath from a vessel which was equal to al-faraq in measurement (i.e., containing water about seven or eight seers).   Abu Dawud said: Ibn ‘Uyainah also narrated like the version of Malik.   Abu Dawud said; I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: Al-Faraq contains sixteen rotls (of water). I also heard him say: The sa’of of Ibn Abi Dhi’b contained 5 rotls (of water). The view that a sa’ contains eight rotls (of water) is not safe.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad (b. Hanbal) say: Whoever gave 5 1/3 rotls (measuring) with our rotl alms of fitr (sadaqat al-fitr), he gave in full, Thereupon he was questioned: Are the dates called al-saihani heavier (can one sa’ of them be given as alms of fitr)? He replied: The dates called al-saihani are good. But I do not know (whether water is heavier or the dates).
239 | Jubair b. Mut’im reported :People made a mention of washing because of sexual defilement before the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: I pour (water) on my head three times. And he made a sign with both his hands.
240 | 'Aishah reported :when the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) wanted to wash himself because of sexual defilement, he called for a vessel like HILAB (a vessel used for milking the camel). He then took a handful of water and began to pour it on the right side of his head and then on the left side. He then took water in both his hands together and poured it on his head.
241 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Jumay' ibn Umayr, one of the sons of Banu Taym Allah ibn Tha'labah, said: Accompanied by my mother and aunt I entered upon Aisha. One of them asked her: How did you do while taking a bath? Aisha replied: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed ablution (in the beginning) as he did for prayer. He then poured (water) upon his head three times. But we poured water upon our heads five times due to plaits.
242 | 'Aishah reported :When the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) would take a bath because of sexual defilement, according to the version of Sulaiman, in the beginning he would pour water with his right hand (upon his left hand); and according to the version of Musaddad, he would wash both (hands) pouring water from the vessel upon his right hand. According to the agreed version, he then would wash the private part. He would then perform ablution as he did for prayer, then put his hands in the vessel and made the water go through his hair. When he knew that water had reached the entire surface of the body and cleaned it well, he would pour water upon his head three times. If some water was left, he would pour it also upon himself.
243 | 'Aishah said; When the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) intended to take a bath because of sexual defilement, he would begin with his hands and wash them. Then he would wash the joints of his limbs and pour water upon him when he cleansed both his (hands), he would rub them on the wall (to make them perfectly clean with the dust). Then he would perform ablution and pour water over his head.
244 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      If you want, I can certainly show you the marks of the hand of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the wall where he took a bath because of sexual defilement.
245 | Maimunah reported:I placed (the vessel of) water for the Prophet (May peace be upon him) to wash himself because of sexual intercourse. He lowered down the vessel and poured water on his right hand. He then washed it twice or thrice. He then poured water over his private parts and washed them with his left hand. Then he put it on the ground and wiped it. He then rinsed his mouth and snuffed up water, and washed his face and hands. He then poured water over his head and body. Then he moved aside and washed his feet. I handed him a garment, but he began to shake he moved aside and washed his feet. I handed him a garment, but he began to shake off water from his body. I mentioned it to Ibrahim. He said that they (companions) did not think there was any harm in using the garment (to wipe the water), but they disliked its use as a habit.   Abu Dawud said: Musaddad said: I asked ‘Abd Allah b. Dawud whether they (the companions) disliked to make it a habit. He replied: it (the tradition) goes in a similar way and I found it in a similar way in this book of mine.
246 | Shu’bah reported :when Ibn ‘Abbas took a bath because of sexual defilement, he poured (water) over his left hand with his right hand seven times. Once he forgot how many times he had poured (water). Therefore he asked me: how many times did I pour (water)? I do not know. He said : may you miss your mother! What prevented you from remembering it? He then performed ablution as he did for prayer and poured water over his skin (body). He then said: this is how the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) purified (himself).
247 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      There were fifty prayers (obligatory in the beginning); and (in the beginning of Islam) washing seven times because of sexual defilement (was obligatory); and washing the urine from the cloth seven times (was obligatory).        The Apostle  of Allah (ﷺ) kept on praying to Allah until the number of prayers was reduced to five and washing because of sexual defilement was allowed only once and washing the urine from the clothe was also permitted only once.
248 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is sexual defilement under every hair; so wash the hair and cleanse the skin.    Abu Dawud said: The tradition narrated by Harith b. Wajih is rejected (Munkar). He is weak (in transmission).
249 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If anyone who is sexual defiled leaves a spot equal to the breadth of a hair without washing, such and such an amount of Hell-fire will have to be suffered for it. Ali said:  On that account I treated my head (hair) as an enemy, meaning I cut my hair. He used to cut the hair (of his head). May Allah be pleased with him.
250 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took a bath and offered two rak'ahs of prayer and said the dawn prayer. I do not think he performed ablution afresh after taking a bath.
251 | Umm Salamah said:one of the Muslims asked, and Zubair reported: Umm Salamah (herself) asked: Messenger of Allah. I am a women who keeps her hair closely plaited; should I undo it when I wash after sexual defilement? He replied (no), it is enough for you to throw three handfuls over it. Then pour water over all your body and will be purified.
252 | Umm Salamah said:A women came to her, this is according to the version of the former tradition. I asked the Prophet (May peace be upon him) a similar question (as in the former tradition). But this version adds: “And wring out your locks after every handful of water”.
253 | 'Aishah said:When any of us was sexually defiled, she took three handfuls (of water) in this way, that is to say, with both hands together and poured (water) over her head. She took one handful (of water) and threw it on one side and the other on the other side.
254 | 'Aishah said:we took a bath while having an adhesive substance over us (our head) in both states, namely, when wearing a robe for Hajj (ihram) and when wearing ordinary clothes (not meant for Hajj).
255 | Narrated Thawban:      Shurayh ibn Ubayd said: Jubayr ibn Nufayr gave me a verdict about the bath because of sexual defilement that Thawban reported to them that they asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about it. He (the Prophet) replied: As regards man, he should undo the hair of his head and wash it until the water should reach the roots of the hair. But there is no harm if the woman does not undo it (her hair) and pour three handfuls of water over her head.
256 | 'Aishah said:The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) used to wash his head with marsh-mallow while he was sexually defiled. It was sufficient for him and he did not pour water upon it.
257 | On being asked about (washing) the fluid that flows between man and woman ‘A’ishah said:The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) used to take a handful of water and pour it on the fluid. Again, he would take a handful of water and pour it over the fluid.
258 | Anas b. malik said:Among the jews, when a women menstruated, they ejected her from the house, and they did not eat with her, nor did they drink with her, nor did they associate with her in (their houses) so the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was questioned about that. Thereupon Allah revealed : “They question thee concerning menstruation. Say : I: is an illness, so let woman alone at such times” (ii 222). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) then said: Associate with them in the houses and do everything except sexual intercourse. Thereupon the Jews said: This man does not want to leave anything we do without opposing us in it. Usaid b. Hudair and Abbad b. Bishr came and said: Messenger of Allah, the jews are saying such and such a thing. Shall we not then have intercourse with women during mensuration? The face of the Apostle Allah(ﷺ) underwent such a change that we thought he was angry with them; but when they went out they received a gift of milk which was being brought to the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ), and he sent after them and gave them a drink, whereupon we thought that he was not angry with them.
259 | 'Aishah said:I would eat flesh from a bone when I was menstruating, then hand it over to the Prophet(ﷺ) and he would put his mouth where I had put my mouth: I would drink, then hand it over to him, and he would put his mouth( at the place) where I drank.
260 | 'Aishah said:The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) would recline on my lap when I was menstruating, then recite the Qur’an.
261 | 'Aishah said:The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said to me; Get me the mat from the mosque. I said ; I am menstruating. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) then replied: Your menstruation is not in your hand.
262 | Mu’adhah reported :A woman asked ‘A’ishah: should a menstruating woman complete the prayer abandoned during the period of menses? ‘A’ishah said: Are you a Haruriyyah? During menstruation in the time of the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) we would not complete (the abandoned prayers), nor were we commanded to complete them.
263 | This tradition has also been narrated through a different chain of  the authority of Mu’adhah al-‘Adawiyyah from ‘A’ishah. This version adds; we were commanded to complete the (abandoned) fast, but were commanded to complete the (abandoned) prayer.
264 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said about a person who had intercourse with his wife while she was menstruating: He must give one dinar or half a dinar in alms.   Abu Dawud said: The correct version says si: One dinar or half a dinar. Shu'bah (a narrator) did not sometimes narrate this tradition as a statement of the Prophet (ﷺ).
265 | Ibn ‘Abbas said:If one has intercourse in the beginning of the menses,(one should give) one dinar; in case one has intercourse towards the end of the menses, then half a dinar (should be given)
266 | Ibn ‘Abbas reported the Prophet (May peace be upon him) as saying; when a man has intercourse with his wife while she is menstruating, he must give half a dinar in alms.   Abu Dawud said; ‘Ali b. Budhaimah reported similarly on the authority of Miqsam from the Prophet (May peace be upon him). Al-Awza’I narrated from Yazid b. Abi Malik, from ‘Abd al-Hamid b. ‘Abd al-Rahman from the Prophet (May peace be upon him); He ordered him to give two fifth of a dinar in alms. But this is a chain where two narrators (Miqsam and Ibn ‘Abbas) are missing.
267 | Maimunah said:The Prophet (ﷺ) would contact and embrace any of his wives while she was menstruating. She would wear the wrapper up to half the the thighs or cover her knees with it.
268 | 'Aishah said; When anyone amongst us (the wives of the Prophet) menstruated, the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) asked her to tie a waist wrapper (over her body) and then husband lay with her, or he (Shu’bah) said:embraced her.
269 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Khallas al-Hujari reported: Aisha said: I and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pass night in one (piece of) cloth (on me) while I menstruated profusely. If anything from me (i.e. blood) smeared him (i.e. his body), he would wash that spot and would not exceed it (in washing), then he would offer prayer with it.
270 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Umarah ibn Ghurab said that his paternal aunt narrated to him that she asked Aisha: What if one of us menstruates and she and her husband have no bed except one? She replied: I relate to you what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had done.       One night he entered (upon me) while I was menstruating. He went to the place of his prayer, that is, to the place of prayer reserved (for this purpose) in his house. He did not return until I felt asleep heavily, and he felt pain from cold. And he said: Come near me. I said: I am menstruating. He said: Uncover your thighs. I, therefore, uncovered both of my thighs. Then he put his cheek and chest on my thighs and I lent upon he until he became warm and slept.
271 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      When I menstruated, I left the bed and lay on the reed-mat and did not approach or come near the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) until we were purified.
272 | Narrated One of the Wives of the Prophet:      Ikrimah reported on the authority of one of the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) saying: When the Prophet (ﷺ) wanted to do something (i.e. kissing, embracing) with (his) menstruating wife, he would put a garment on her private part.
273 | 'Aishah said; The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) would ask us in the beginning of our menstruation to tie the waist-wrapper. Then he would embrace us. And who amongst you can have as much control over his desire as the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) had over his desire?
274 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      In the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) there was a woman who had an issue of blood. So Umm Salamah asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to give a decision about her. He said: She should consider the number of nights and days during which she used to menstruate each month before she was afflicted with this trouble and abandon prayer during that period each month. When those days and nights are over, she should take a bath, tie a cloth over her private parts and pray.
275 | Sulaiman b. Yasar said that a man reported to him from Umm Salamah; There was a woman who had an issue of blood. And he narrated the rest of the tradition to the same effect saying; when the menstruation period is over and the time of prayer arrives, she should take a bath, as mentioned in the previous tradition.
276 | Sulaiman b. Yasar reported on the authority of a person from the Ansar; There was a woman who had an issue of blood. He then narrated the rest of the tradition like that of al-Laith. He said; when the period of menstruation is over and the time of prayer arrives, she should take a bath. He narrated the tradition conveying the same meaning.
277 | This tradition has been transmitted through the chain of narrators like that of al-Laith to the same effect. It says; She should abandon prayer considering that period (she used to menstruate). When the time of prayer approaches, she should take a bath, tie a cloth over her private parts and offer prayer.
278 | Sulaiman b. Yasar reported this narrative on the authority of Umm Salamah. This version has:He (the Prophet) said: She should abandon prayer and  take a bath at the beginning of the additional period, and tie a cloth over her private parts and offer prayer.   Abu Dawud said; Hammad b. Zaid on the authority of Ayyub has pointed out the name of the woman who had a prolonged flow of blood (referred to) in this tradition to be Fatimah daughter of Abu Hubaish.
279 | 'Aishah reported :Umm Habibah asked the prophet (ﷺ) about the blood (which flows beyond the period of menstruation). ‘A’ishah said: I saw her wash-tub full of blood. The apostle of Allah (May peace be upon him) said; Keep away (from prayer) equal (to the length of time) that your menses prevented you. Then wash yourself.   Abu Dawud said: Qutaibah mentioned the name Jaftar b. Rabi’ah in the middle of the text of the tradition for the second time (i.e., Qutaibah, being doubtful about the narrator Jafar b. Rabi’ah, mentioned his name twice: once in the chain and again while reporting the text). Ali b. ‘Ayyash and yunus b. Muhammad reported it on the authority of al-Laith. They mentioned the name Jafar b. Rabi’ah.
280 | Narrated Fatimah daughter of AbuHubaysh:      Urwah ibn az-Zubayr said that Fatimah daughter of AbuHubaysh narrated to him that she asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and complained to him about the flowing of (her) blood. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her: That is only (due to) a vein: look, when your menstruation comes, do not pray; and when your menstruation ends, wash yourself and then offer prayer during the period from one menstruation to another.
281 | 'Urwah b. al-Zubair said:Fatimah daughter of Abu Hubaish narrated to me that she asked Asma' (daughter of Abu Bakr), or Asma' narrated to me that Fatimah daughter of Abu Hubaish asked her to question the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He advised her to refrain (from prayer) equal to the period she refrained previously. She then should wash herself.1   Abu Dawud said: Qatadah narrated it from 'Urwah b. al-Zubair, from Zainab daughter of Umm Salamah, that Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded her to abandon prayer for the period of her menses. She then should take a bath, and offer prayer. Abu Dawud said: Qatadah did not hear anything from 'Urwah. 2   And Ibn 'Uyainah added in the tradition narrated by al-Zuhri from 'Umrah on the authority of 'Aishah. Umm Habibah had a prolonged flow of blood. She asked the Prophet (ﷺ). He commanded her to abandon prayer during her menstrual period.   Abu Dawud said: This is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn 'Uyainah. This is not found in the tradition reported by the transmitter from al-Zuhri except that mentioned by Suhail b. Abu Salih. Al-Humaidi also narrated this tradition from Ibn 'Uyainah, but he did not mention the words "she should abandon prayer during her menstrual period."1   Qumair daughter of Masruq reported on the authority of 'Aishah: The woman who has prolonged flow of blood should abandon prayer during her menstrual period.3   'Abd al-Rahman b. al-Qasim reported on the authority of his father: The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded her to abandon prayers equal (to the length of time) that she has her (usual) menses.2   Abu Bishr Ja'far b. Abi Wahshiyyah reported on the authority of 'Ikrimah from the Prophet (ﷺ) saying: Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh had a prolonged flow of blood; and he transmitted like that.1   Sharik narrated from Abu al-Yaqzan from  'Adi b. Thabit from his father on the authority of his grandfather from the Prophet (ﷺ): The woman suffering from a prolonged flow of blood should abandon prayer during her menstrual period ; she then should was herself and pray. 1   Al-'Ala b. al-Musayyab reported from al-Hakam on the authority of Abu Ja'far, saying: Saudah had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded that when he menstruation was finished, she should take bath and pray.1   Sa'id b. Jubair reported from 'Ali and Ibn 'Abbas : A woman suffering from a prolonged flow of blood should refrain from prayers during her menstrual period.1   'Ammar, the freed slave of Banu Hashim and Talq b. Habib narrated in a similar way.1  Similarly, it was reported by Ma'qil al-Khath'ami from 'Ali4, al-Sha'bi also transmitted it in a similar manner from Qumair, the wife of Masruq, on the authority of 'Aishah.1   Abu Dawud said: Al-Hasan, Sa'id b. al-Musayyab, 'Ata, Makhul, Ibrahim, Salim and al-Qasim also hold that a woman suffering from a prolonged flow of blood should abandon prayer during her menstrual period.   Abu Dawud said: Qatadah did not hear anything from 'Urwah.
282 | 'Urwah reported on the authority of 'Aishah:Fatimah daughter of Abu Hubaish came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: I am a woman who has prolonged flow of blood; I am never purified ; should I abandon prayer ? He replied: This is (due to) a vein, and not menstruation. When the menstruation begins, you should abandon prayer ; when it is finished, you should wash away the blood and pray.
283 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Zuhair through a different chain of narrators, to the same effect. He said:When the menstruation begins, you should abandon prayer; when the period equal to its length of time passes, you should wash away the blood and pray.
284 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Bahiyyah said: I heard a woman asking Aisha about the woman whose menses became  abnormal and she had an issue of blood. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked me to advise her that she should consider the period during which she used to menstruate every month, when her menstruation was normal. Then she should count the days equal to the length of time (of her normal menses); then she should abandon prayer during those days or equal to that period. She should then take a bath, tie a cloth on her private parts a pray.
285 | 'Aishah said:Umm Habibah, daughter of Jahsh and sister-in-law of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)m and wife of 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, had a prolonged flow of blood for seven years. She inquired from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is not menstruation, but this (due to) a vein. Therefore, wash yourself and pray.   Abu Dawud said: In this tradition which is transmitted by al-Zuhri from 'Urwah and 'Urwah on the authority of 'Aishah, al-Awza'i added: She ('Aishah) said: Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh and wife of 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf had a prolonged flow of blood for seven years. The Prophet (ﷺ) commander her saying: When the menstruation begins, abandon prayer; when it is finished, take a bath and pray.   Abu Dawud said: None of the disciple of al-Zuhri mentioned these words except al-Awza'i, from al-Zuhri it has been narrated by  'Amr b. al-Harith, al-Laith, Yunus, Ibn Abi Dhi'b, Ma'mar, Ibrahim b. Sa'd, Sulaiman b. Kathir, Ibn Ishaq and Sufyan b. 'Uyainah, they did not narrate these words.   Abu Dawud said: These are the words of the version reported by Hisham b. 'Urwah from this father on the authority of 'Aishah. 					  Abu Dawud said: In this tradition Ibn 'Uyainah also added the words: He commander her to abandon prayer during her menstrual period. This is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn 'Uyainah. The version of this tradition narrated by Muhammad b. 'Amr from al-Zuhri has the addition similar to that made by al-Awza'i in his version.
286 | Narrated Fatimah daughter of AbuHubaysh:      Urwah ibn az-Zubayr reported from Fatimah daughter of AbuHubaysh that her blood kept flowing, so the Prophet (ﷺ) said to her: When the blood of the menses comes, it is black blood which can be recognised; so when that comes, refrain from prayer; but when a different type of blood comes, perform ablution and pray, for it is (due only to) a vein.   Abu Dawud said: Ibn al-Muthanna narrates this tradition from his book on the authority of Ibn 'Adi in a similar way. Later on he transmitted it to us from his memory: Muhammad b. 'Amr reported to us from al-Zuhri from 'Urwah on the authority of 'Aishah who said: Fatimah used to have her blood flowing. He then reported the tradition conveying the same meaning.   Abu Dawud said: Anas b. Sirin reported from Ibn 'Abbas about the woman who has a prolonged flow of blood. He said: If she sees thick blood, she should not pray; if she finds herself purified even for a moment, she should was an pray.   Makhul said: Menses are not hidden from women. Their blood is black and thick. When it (blackness and thickness) goes away and there appears yellowness and liquidness, that is the flow of blood (from vein). She should wash and pray.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Sa'id b. al-Musayyab through a different chain of narrators, saying: The woman who has a prolonged flow of blood should abandon prayer when the menstruation begins; when it is finished, she should wash and pray.   Sumayy and others have also reported it from Sa'id b. al-Musayyab. This version adds: She should refrain (from prayer) during her menstrual period.   Hammad b. Salamah has reported it similarly from Yahya b. Sa'id on the authority of Sa'id b. al-Musayyab.   Abu Dawud said: Yunus has reported from Al-Hasan: When the bleeding of a menstruating woman extends (beyond the normal period), she should refrain (from prayer), after her menses are over, for one or two days. Now she becomes the woman who has a prolonged flow of blood.   Al-Taimi reported from Qatadah: If her menstrual period is prolonged by five days, she should pray. Al-Taimi said: I kept on reducing (the number of days) until I reached two days. He said: If the period extends by two days, they will be counted from the menstrual period. When Ibn Sirin was questioned about it, he said: Women have better knowledge of that.
287 | Narrated Hamnah daughter of Jahsh:      Hamnah said my menstruation was great in quantity and severe. So I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for a decision and told him. I found him in the house of my sister, Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh.        I said: Messenger of Allah, I am a woman who menstruates in great quantity and it is severe, so what do you think about it? It has prevented me from praying and fasting.        He said: I suggest that you should use cotton, for it absorbs the blood.  She replied: It is too copious for that.  He said: Then take a cloth.  She replied: It is too copious for that, for my blood keeps flowing.  The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I shall give you two commands; whichever of them you follow, that will be sufficient for you without the other, but you know best whether you are strong enough to follow both of them.        He added: This is a stroke of the Devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then wash. And when you see that you are purified and quite clean, pray during twenty-three or twenty-four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you, and do so every month, just as women menstruate and are purified at the time of their menstruation and their purification.        But if you are strong enough to delay the noon (Zuhr) prayer and advance the afternoon ('Asr) prayer, to wash, and then combine the noon and the afternoon prayer; to delay the sunset prayer and advance the night prayer, to wash, and then combine the two prayers, do so: and to wash at dawn, do so: and fast if you are able to do so if possible.      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Of the two commands this is more to my liking.1   Abu Dawud said: 'Amr b. Thabit narrated from Ibn 'Aqil: Hamnah said: Of the two commands this is the one which is more to my liking.2 In this version these words were not quoted as the statement of the Prophet (ﷺ); it gives it as a statement of Hamnah.   Abu Dawud said: 'Amr b. Thabit was a Rafidi. This has been said by Yahya b. Ma'in.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad (b. Hanbal) say: I am doubtful about the tradition transmitted by Ibn 'Aqil.
288 | 'Aishah, wife of Prophet (ﷺ), said:Umm Habibah, daughter of Jahsh, sister-in-law of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and wife of 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, had a flow of blood for seven years. She asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is not menstruation but only vein; so you should take a bath and pray. 'Aishah said: She used to take bath in a wash-tub in the apartment of her sister Zainab daughter of Jahsh ; the redness of (her) blood dominated the water.
289 | This tradition has been transmitted through a different chain of narrators. According to this version. 'Aishah said:She would wash herself for every prayer.
290 | This has bee	n narrated though a different chain of narrators by 'Aishah. This version has the words:"She used to take a bath for every prayer."   Abu Dawud said: Al-Qasim b. Mabrur reported from Yunus from Ibn Shihab from 'Amrah from 'Aishah from Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh. Similarly, it was reported by Ma'mar from al-Zuhri from 'Amrah from 'Aishah. Ma'mar sometimes reported from 'Amrah on the authority of Umm Habibah to the same effect. Similarly, it was reported by Ibrahim b. Sa'd and Ibn 'Uyainah from al-Zuhri from 'Amrah from 'Aishah. Ibn 'Uyainah said in his version: He (al-Zuhri) did not say that the Prophet (ﷺ) commanded her to take bath.   It has also been transmitted by al-Awza'i in a similar way. In this version he said: 'Aishah said: She used to take bath for very prayer.
291 | 'Aishah said:Umm Habibah had a prolonged flow of blood for seven years. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded her to take bath; so she used to take bath for every prayer.
292 | 'Aishah said:Umm Habibah had a prolonged flow of blood during the time of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He commanded her to take bath for every prayer. The narrator then transmitted the tradition (in full). 	  Abu Dawud said: It has also been narrated by Abu al-Walid al-Tayalisi, but I did not hear him. He reported it from 'Aishah through a different chain of narrators. 'Aishah said: Zainab daughter of Jahsh had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to her: Take bath for every prayer. The narrator then reported the tradition (in full).   Abu Dawud said: The version transmitted by 'Abd al-Samad from Sulaiman b. Kathir has: "Perform ablution for every prayer." This is a misunderstanding on the part of 'Abd al-Samad. The correct version is the one narrated by Abu al-Walid.
293 | Narrated Zaynab daughter of AbuSalamah:      AbuSalamah said: Zaynab daughter of AbuSalamah reported to me that a woman had a copious flow of blood. She was the wife of AbdurRahman ibn Awf. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded her to take a bath at the time of every prayer, and then to pray. He reported to me that Umm Bakr told him that Aisha said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said about a woman who was doubtful of her menstruation after purification that it was a vein or veins.   Abu Dawud said: The two commands (of which the Prophet gave option) were as follows in the version reported by Ibn 'Aqil: He said: If you are strong enough, then take a bath for every prayer; otherwise combine the (two prayers), as al-Qasim reported in his version. This statement was also narrated by Sa'id b. Jubair from 'Ali and Ibn 'Abbas.
294 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      A woman had a prolonged flow of blood in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She was commanded to advance the afternoon prayer and delay the noon prayer, and to take a bath for them only once; and to delay the sunset prayer and advance the night prayer and to take a bath only once for them; and to take a bath separately for the dawn prayer.       I (Shu'bah) asked AbdurRahman: (Is it) from the Prophet (ﷺ)? I do not report to you anything except from the Prophet (ﷺ).
295 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Sahlah daughter of Suhayl had a prolonged flow of blood. She came to the Prophet (ﷺ). He commanded her to take a bath for every prayer. When it became hard for her, he commanded her to combine the noon and afternoon prayers with one bath and the sunset and night prayer with one bath, and to take a bath (separately) for the dawn prayer.    Abu Dawud said: Ibn 'Uyainah reported from 'Abd al-Rahman b. al-Qasim on the authority of his father, saying: A woman had a prolonged flow of blood. She asked the Prophet (ﷺ). He commanded her to the same effect.
296 | Asma' daughter of 'Unais said:I said: Messenger of Allah, Fatimah daughter of Abu Hubaish had a flow of blood for a certain period and did not pray. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Glory be to Allah! This comes from the devil. She should sit in a tub, and when she sees yellowness of the top of the water, she would take a bath once for the Zuhr and 'Asr prayer, and take another bath for the Maghrib and 'Isha prayers, and take a bath once for the fajr prayer, and in between times she would perform ablution.   Abu Dawud said: Mujahid reported on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas: When bathing became hard for her, he commanded her to combine the two prayers. 												  Abu Dawud said: Ibrahim reported it from Ibn 'Abbas. This is also the view of Ibrahim al-Nakha'i and 'Abd Allah b. Shaddad.
297 | Narrated Grandfather of Adi ibn Thabit ?:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said about the woman having a prolonged flow of blood: She should abandon prayer during her menstrual period: then she should take a bath and pray. She should perform ablution for every prayer.   Abu Dawud said: 'Uthman added: She should keep fast and pray.
298 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Fatimah daughter of AbuHubaysh came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and narrated what happened with her. He said: Then take a bath and then perform ablution for every prayer and pray.
299 | 'Aishah said about the woman who has a prolonged flow of blood:She should take bath, i.e. only once; then she should perform ablution until he next menstrual period.
300 | This tradition has also been narrated by 'Aishah through a different chain of transmitters.   Abu Dawud said:All the traditions (on this subject) transmitted by 'Adi b. Thabit and A'mash on the authority of Habib and Ayyub al-'Ala, all of them are weak; none of them is sound. This tradition indicates	the tradition reported by al-A'mash a a statement of Companion, i.e. 'Aishah. Hafs b. Ghayath has rejected the tradition transmitted by Habib as the statement (of the Prophet). And Asbat also reported it as a statement of 'Aishah.   Abu Dawud said: Ibn Dawud has narrated the first part of this tradition as a statement (of the Prophet), and denied that there was any mention of performing ablution for every prayer. The weakness of the tradition reported by Habib is also indicated by the fact that the version transmuted by al-Zuhri from 'Urwah on the authority of 'Aishah says that she used to wash herself for every prayer; (these words occur) in the tradition about the woman who has a flow of blood. This tradition has been reported by Abu al-Yaqzan from 'Adi b. Thabit from his father from 'Ali, and narrated by 'Ammar, the freed salve of Banu Hashim, from Ibn 'Abbas, and transmitted by 'Abd al-Malik b. Maisarah, Bayan, al-Mughirah, Firas, on the authority of al-Sha'bi, from Qumair from 'Aishah, stating: You should perform ablution for every prayer. The version transmitted by Dawud, and 'Asim from al-Sha'bi from Qumair from 'Aishah has the words: She should take bath only once every day. The version reported by Hisham b. 'Urwah from his father has the words: The woman having a flow of blood should perform ablution for every prayer. All these traditions are weak except the tradition reported by Qumair and the tradition reported by 'Ammar, the freed slave of Banu Hashim, and the tradition narrated by Hisham b. 'Urwah on the authority of his father. What is commonly known from Ibn 'Abbas is bathing (for every prayer).
301 | Sumayy, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, says that al-Qa'qa and Zaid b. Aslam sent him to Sa'id b. al-Musayyab to ask him as to how the woman who has flow of blood should wash. He replied:She should wash at the time of the Zuhr prayer (the bath will be valid one Zuhr prayer to the next Zuhr prayer); and should perform ablution for every prayer. If there is excessive bleed gin, she should tie a cloth over her private part.   Abu Dawud said: It has been narrated by Ibn 'Umar and Anas b. Malik that she should take bath at the time of the Zuhr prayer (being valid) until the next Zuhr prayer. This tradition has also been transmuted by Dawud and 'Asim from al-Sha'bi from his wife from Qumair on the authority of 'Aishah, except that the version of Dawud has the words: "every day," and the version of 'Asim has the words: "at the time of Zuhr prayer". This is the view of Salim b. 'Abd Allah, al-Hassan, and 'Ata.   Abu Dawud said: Malik said: I think that the tradition narrated by Ibn a;-Musayyab must contain the words: "from one purification to another". But it was misunderstood and the people changed it to: "for one Zuhr prayer to another".   It has also been reported by Miswar b. 'Abd al-Malik b. Sa'id b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Yarbu', saying: "from one purification to another," but the people changed it to: "from one zuhr to another."
302 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The woman who has a prolonged flow of blood should wash herself every day when her  menstrual period is over and take a woollen cloth greased with fat or oil (to tie over the private parts).
303 | Muhammad b. 'Uthman asked al-Qasim b. Muhammad about the woman who has a prolonged flow of blood. He replied:She should abandon prayer during her menstrual period, then wash and pray ; then she should wash during her menstrual period.
304 | 'Urwah b. al-Zubair said the Fatimah daughter of Abu Hubaish had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to her:When the blood of menses comes, it is black blood with can be recognized; so when that comes, refrain from prayer, but when a different type comes, perform ablution and pray.   Abu Dawud said: Ibn al-Muthanna said: Ibn 'Adi narrated this tradition from his memory on the authority of 'Urwah from 'Aishah.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by al-'Ala b. al-Musayyab and Shu'bah from al-Hakam on the authority of Abu Ja'far. Al-'Ala reported it as a statement of the Prophet (ﷺ), and Shu'bah as a statement of Abu Ja'far, saying: She should perform ablution for every prayer.
305 | Narrated Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh:      Ikrimah said: Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded her to refrain (from prayer) during her menstrual period; then she should wash and pray, if she sees anything (which renders ablution void) she should perform ablution and pray.
306 | Rabi'ah said:Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) commander her to refrain (from prayer) during her menstrual period; then she should wash and pray. If she sees anything (which renders ablution void) she should perform ablution and pray.   Abu Dawud said: This is the view held by Malik b. Anas.
307 | Umm 'Atiyyah who took an oath of allegiance to the Prophet (ﷺ) said:We would not take into consideration brown and yellow (fluid) after purification.
308 | 'Umm 'Atiyyah has narrated this tradition through a different chain of transmitters.   Abu DAwud said:The name of Umm al-Hudhail is Hafsah daughter os Sirin. The name of her son was Hudhail and his husband 'Abd al-Rahman.
309 | 'Ikrimah said:Umm Habibah had a prolonged flow of blood ; her husband used to cohabit with her.   Abu Dawud said: Yahya b. Ma'in has pronounced Mu'alla (a narrator of this tradition) as trustworthy. But Ahmad b. Hanbal would not report (traditions) from him because he exercised personal opinion.
310 | 'Ikrimah reported Hamnah daughter of Jahsh as saying that her husband would have intercourse with her during the period she had a flow of blood.
311 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      The woman having bleeding after delivery (puerperal haemorrhage) would refrain (from prayer) for forty days or forty nights; and we would anoint our faces with an aromatic herb called wars to remove dark spots.
312 | Al-Azdiyyah, viz. Mussah, said:I performed Hajj and came to Umm Salamah and said (to her): Mother of the believers, Samurah b. Jundub commands women to complete the prayers abandoned during their menstrual period. She said: They should not do so. The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) would refrain (from prayer) for forty nights (i.e. days) during the course of bleeding after child birth. The Prophet (ﷺ) would not command them to complete the prayers abandoned during the period of bleeding.   Muhammad b. Hatim said: The name of Al-Azdiyyah is Mussah and her patronymic name is Umm Busrah.   Abu Dawud said: The patronymic names of Kathir b. Ziyad s Abu Sahl.
313 | Narrated Woman of Banu Ghifar:      Umayyah, daughter of AbusSalt, quoted a certain woman of Banu Ghifar, whose name was mentioned to me, as saying: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made me ride behind him on the rear of the camel saddle. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got down in the morning. He made his camel kneel down and I came down from the back of his saddle. There was a mark of blood on it (saddle) and that was the first menstruation that I had. I stuck to the camel and felt ashamed.        When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw what had happened to me and saw the blood, he said: Perhaps you are menstruating.        I said: Yes.  He then said: Set yourself right (i.e. tie some cloth to prevent bleeding), then take a vessel of water and put some salt in it, and then wash the blood from the back of the saddle, and then return to your mount. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) conquered Khaybar, he gave us a portion of the booty. Whenever the woman became purified from her menses, she would put salt in water. And when she died, she left a will to put salt in the water for washing her (after death).
314 | 'Aishah reported:Asma' entered upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, how should one of us take bath when she is purified from her menses ? He said: She should take water mixed with the leaves of lote-tree; then should perform ablution and wash her head and rub it so much so that water reaches the roots of the hair; she should then our water upon her body. Then she should take a piece of cloth (or cotton or wool) and purify with it. She asked: Messenger of Allah, how should I purify with it ? 'Aishah said: I understood what he (the Prophet) said metaphorically. I, therefore, said to her: Remove the marks of blood.
315 | 'Aishah made a mention of the women of the Ansar and admired them stating that they had obliged (all Muslims). She then said:One of their women came upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She then reported the rest of the tradition to the same effect; but this version she said the words: "a musk-scented piece of cloth."   Musaddad said: Abu 'Awanah used the word firsah (i.e. a piece of cloth), but Abu Al-Ahwas used the word qasrah (i.e. a small piece of cloth).
316 | 'Aishah said:Asma' asked the Prophet (ﷺ) and then narrated the rest of the tradition to the same effect. He (the Prophet) said: "a musk-scented piece of cloth." She (Asma') said: How should I purify with it ? He said: By glory of Allah ! Purify with it, and he covered his face with the cloth. This version also adds: "She asked about the washing because of sexual defilement." He said: Take your water and purify yourself as best as possible. Then pour water over yourself. 'Aishah said: The best of the women are the women of the Ansar. Shyness would not prevent them from inquiring about religion and from acquiring deep understanding in it.
317 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent Usayd ibn Hudayr and some people with him to search the necklace lost by Aisha. The time of prayer came and they prayed without ablution. When they returned to the Prophet (ﷺ) and related the fact to him, the verse concerning tayammum was revealed.       Ibn Nufayl added: Usayd said to her: May Allah have mercy upon you! Never has there been an occasion when you were beset with an unpleasant matter but Allah made the Muslims and you come out of that.
318 | Narrated Ammar ibn Yasir:      They (the Companions of the Prophet) wiped with pure earth (their hands and face) to offer the dawn prayer in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). They struck the ground with their palms and wiped their faces once. Then they repeated and struck the ground with their palms once again and wiped their arms completely up to the shoulders and up to the armpits with the inner side of their hands.
319 | The tradition has also been reported through a different chain of narrators. This version has:The Muslims stood up and struck the earth with their palms, but did not get any earth (in their hands). He (Ibn Wahb) then narrated the rest of the tradition in like manner, but he did not mention the words "shoulders" and "armpits". Ibn al-Laith said: (They) wiped above the elbows.
320 | Narrated Ammar ibn Yasir:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) encamped at Ulat al-Jaysh and Aisha was in his company. Her necklace of onyx of Zifar was broken (and fell somewhere). The people were detained to make a search for that necklace until the dawn broke. There was no water with the people. Therefore AbuBakr became angry with her and said: You detained the people and they have no water with them.        Thereupon Allah, the Exalted, sent down revelation about it to His Apostle (ﷺ) granting concession to purify themselves with pure earth. Then the Muslims stood up with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and struck the ground with their hands and then they raised their hands, and did not take any earth (in their hands). Then they wiped with them their faces and hands up to the shoulders, and from their palms up to the armpits.    Ibn Yahya added in his version: Ibn Shihab said in his tradition: The people do not take this (tradition) into account.   Abu Dawud said: Ibn Ishaq also reported it in a similar way. In this (version) he said on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas. He mentioned the words "two strikes" (i.e. striking the earth twice) as mentioned by Yunus. And Ma'mar also narrated on the authority of al-Zuhri "two strikes". And Malik said: From al-Zuhri from 'Ubaid Allah b. 'Abd Allah from his father on the authority of 'Ammar. Abu Uwais also reported it in a similar way on the authority of al-Zuhri. But Ibn 'Uyainah doubted it, he sometimes said: from his father, and sometimes he said: from Ibn 'Abbas. Ibn 'Uyainah was confused in it and in his hearing from al-Zuhri. No one has mentioned "two strikes" in this tradition except those whose names I have mentioned.
321 | Shaqiq said:While I was sitting between 'Abd Allah and Abu Musa, the latter said: Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, what do you think if a man becomes defiled (because of seminal omission) and does not find water for a month; should he not perform tayammum ? He replied: No, even if he does not find water for a month. Abu Musa then said: How will you do with the Qur'anic version (about tayammum) in the chapter al-Ma'idah which says: "... and you find no water, then go to clean, high ground" (5:6)? 'Abd Allah (b. Mas'ud) then said: If they (the people) are granted concession in this respect, they might perform tayammum with pure earth when water is cold. Abu Musa said: For this (reason) you forbade it ? He said: Yes. Abu Musa then said: Did you not hear what 'Ammar said to 'Umar ? (He said): The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent me on some errand. I had seminal emission and I did not find water. Therefore, I rolled on the ground just as an animal rolls down. I then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and made a mention of that to him. He said: It would have been enough for you to do thus. Then he struck the ground with his hands and shook them off and then stuck the right hand with his left hand and his left hand with his right hand (and wiped) over his hands (up to the wrist) and wiped his face. 'Abd Allah then said to him: Did you not see that 'Umar was not satisfied with the statement of 'Ammar ?
322 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abza said:While I was with 'Umar, a man came to him and said: We live at a place (where water is not found) for a month or two (what should we do, if we are sexually defiled). 'Umar said: So far as I am concerned, I do not pray until I find water. 'Ammar said: Commanded of the faithful, do you not remember when I and you were among the camels (For tending them)? There we became sexually defiled. I rolled down on the ground. We then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and I mentioned that to him. He said: It was enough for you to do so. Then he struck the ground with both his hands. He then blew over them and wiped his face and both hands by means of them up to half the arms. 'Umar said: 'Ammar, fear Allah. He said: Commander of the faithful, if you want, I will never narrate it. 'Umar said: Nay, by Allah, we shall turn you from that towards which you turned (i.e. you have your choice).
323 | Ibn Abza reported on the authority of 'Ammar b. Yasir in this tradition as saying (from the Prophet):'Ammar, it would have been enough for you (to do) so. He then stuck only one stroke on the ground with both his hands; he then stuck one with the other; then wiped his face and both arms up to half the forearms and did not reach the elbows.   Abu Dawud said: This is also transmitted by Waki' from al-A'mash from Salamah b. Kuhail from 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abza.   It is also transmitted through a different chain by Jarir from al-A'mash from Salamah from Sa'id b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abza from his father.
324 | Ibn 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abza reported on the authority of his father this incident from 'Ammar. He said:This would have been enough for you, and the Prophet (ﷺ) struck the ground with his hand. He then blew it and wiped with it his face and hands. Being doubtful Salamah said: I do not know (whether he wiped) up to the elbows or the wrists.
325 | This is transmitted by Shu'bah through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:He ('Ammar) said: He (the Prophet) then blew it and wiped with it his face and hands up to elbows or up to the forearms. Shu'bah said: Salamah used to narrate (the words) "the hands and the face and the forearms". One day Mansur said to him: Look, what are you saying, because no one except you mentions the (word) "forearms".
326 | This is also transmitted by Ibn 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abza on the authority of his father from 'Ammar. He reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:It would have been enough for you to strike the ground with you hands and then wipe them your face and your hands (up to the wrists). He then narrated the rest of the tradition.   Abu Dawud said: This is also transmitted by Shu'bah from Husain on the authority of Abu Malik. He said: I heard 'Ammar saying so him his speech, except that in this version he added the words: "He blew." And Husain b. Muhammad narrated from Shu'bah on the authority of al-Hakam and in this version added the words:"He (the Prophet) struck the earth with his plans and blew."
327 | 'Ammar b. Yasir said:I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about tayammum. He commanded me to strike only one stroke (i.e. the strike the ground) for (wiping) the face and the hands.
328 | Aban said:Qatadah was asked about tayammum during a journey. He said: A traditionist reported to me from al-Sha'bi from 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abza on the authority of 'Ammar b. Yasir who reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: (He should wipe) up to the elbows.
329 | 'Umair, the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas, said that he heard him say:I and 'Abd Allah b. Yasar, the freed slave of Maimunah, wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), came and entered upon Abu al-Juhaim b. al-Harith b. al-Simmat al-Ansari. Abu al-Juhaim said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came from Bir Jamal (a place near Medina) and a man met him and saluted him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not return the salutation until he came to a wall and wiped his face and hands and then returned the salutation (i.e. after performing tayammum).
330 | Nafi' said:Accompanied by 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar, I went to Ibn 'Abbas for a certain work. He (Ibn 'Abbas) narrated a tradition saying: A man passed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a street, while he returned from the toilet or just urinated. He (the man) saluted him, but the Prophet did not return the salutation. When the man was about to disappear (from sight) in the street he struck the wall with both his hands and wiped his face with them. He then struck another stroke and wipes his arms. He then returned the man's salutation. Then he said: I did not return the salutation to you because I was not purified.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: Muhammad b. Thabit reported a rejected tradition.   Ibn Dasah said: Abu Dawud said: No one supported Muhammad b. Thabit in respect of narrating this tradition as to striking the wall twice (for wiping) from the Prophet (ﷺ), but reported it as an action of Ibn 'Umar.
331 | Ibn 'Umar said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came from the privy. A man met him near Bir Jamal and saluted him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not return the salutation until he came to a wall and placed his hands on the wall and wiped his face and hands; he then returned the man's salutation.
332 | Abu Dharr said:A few goats got collected with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: Abu Dharr, drive them to the wood. I drove them to Rabadhah (a place near Medina). I would have sexual defilement (during my stay there) and I would remain (in this condition) for five or six days. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: O Abu Dharr. I kept silence. He then said: May your mother bereave you, Abu Dharr: woe be to your mother. He then called a black slave-girl for me. She brought a vessel which contained water. She then concealed me by drawing a curtain and I concealed myself behind a she-camel, and took a bath. I felt as if I had thrown away a mountain from me. He said: Clean earth is a means for ablution for a Muslim, even for ten years (he does not find water); but when you find water, you should make it touch your skin, for that is better.   The version of Musaddad has: "the goats (were collected) from the alms," and the tradition reported by 'Amr is complete.
333 | A man from Banu 'Amir said:I embraced Islam and my (ignorance of the) religion made me anxious (to learn the essentials). I came to Abu Dharr. Abu Dharr said: The climate of Medina did not suit me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered me to have a few camels and goats. He said to me: Drink their milk. (The narrator Hammad said): I doubt whether he (the Prophet) said: "their urine." Abu Dharr said: I was away from the watering place and I had my family with me. I would have sexual defilement and pray without purification. I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at noon. He was resting in the shade of the mosque along with a group of Companions. He (the Prophet) said: Abu Dharr. I said: Yes, I am ruined, Messenger of Allah. He said: What ruined you ? I said: I was away from the watering place and I had family with me. I used to be sexually defiled and pray without purification. He commanded (to bring) water for me. Then a black slave-girl brought a vessel of water that was shaking as the vessel was not full. I concealed myself behind a camel and took bath and them came (to the Prophet). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Abu Dharr, clean earth is a means of ablution, even if you do not find water for ten years. When you find water, you should make it touch your skin.   Abu Dawud said: This is transmitted by Hammad b. Zaid from Ayyub. This version does not mention the words "their urine." This is not correct. The words "their urine" occur only in the version reported by Anas and transmitted only by the people of Basrah.
334 | Narrated Amr ibn al-'As:      I had a sexual dream on a cold night in the battle of Dhat as-Salasil. I was afraid, if I washed I would die. I, therefore, performed tayammum and led my companions in the dawn prayer. They mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: Amr, you led your companions is prayer while you were sexually defiled? I informed him of the cause which impeded me from washing. And I said: I heard Allah say: "Do not kill yourself, verily Allah is merciful to you." The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) laughed and did not say anything.   Abu Dawud said: 'Abd al-Rahman b. Jubair is an Egyptian and a freed slave of Kharijah b. Hudhafah. He is not Jubair b. Nufair
335 | Abu Qais, the freed slave of 'Amr b. al-'As, said 'Amr b. al-'As was in a battle. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. He then said:He washed his armpits and other joints where dirt was found, and he performed ablution like that for prayer. Then he led them in prayer. He then narrated the tradition in a similar way but did not mention of tayammum.   Abu Dawud said: This incident has also been narrated by al-'Awza'i on the authority of Hassan b. 'Atiyyah. This version has the words: Then he performed tayammum.
336 | Jabir said:We set out on a journey. One of our people was hurt by a stone, that injured his head. He then had a sexual dream. He asked his fellow travelers: Do you find a concession for me to perform tayammum? They said: We do not find any concession for you while you can use water. He took a bath and died. When we came to the Prophet (ﷺ), the incident was reported to him. He said: They killed him, may Allah kill them! Could they not ask when they did not know? The cure for ignorance is inquiry. It was enough for him to perform tayammum and to pour some drops of water or bind a bandage over the wound (the narrator Musa was doubtful); then he should have wiped over it and washed the rest of his body.
337 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A man was injured during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); he then had a sexual dream, and he was advised to wash and he washed himself. Consequently he died. When this was reported to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) he said: They killed him; may Allah kill them! Is not inquiry the cure of ignorance?
338 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said:Two persons set out on a journey. Meanwhile the time of prayer came and they had no water. They performed tayammum with clean earth and prayed. Later on they found water within the time of the prayer. One of them repeated the prayer and ablution but the other did not repeat. Then they came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and related the matter to him. Addressing himself to the one who did not repeat, he said: You followed the sunnah (model behavior of the Prophet) and your (first) prayer was enough for you. He said to the one who performed ablution and repeated: For you there is the double reward.   Abu Dawud said: Besides Ibn Nafi' this is transmitted by al-Laith from 'Umairah b. Abi Najiyyah from Bakr b. Sawadah on the authority of 'Ata b. Yasar from the Prophet (ﷺ).   Abu Dawud said: The mention of (the name of the Companion) Abu Sa'id in this tradition is not guarded. This is a mural tradition (i.e. the Successor 'Ata b. Yasar directly narrates it from the Prophet, leaving the name of the Companion in the chain.)
339 | 'Ata b. Yasar said:Two persons from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); he then narrated the rest of the tradition to the same effect.
340 | Abu Hurairah said:While 'Umar b. al-Khattab was making a speech on Friday (in the mosque), a man came in. 'Umar said: Are you detained from prayer ? The man said: As soon as I heard the call for prayer, I perfumed ablution. Then 'Umar said: Only ablution ? Did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: When any one of you comes for Friday (prayer) he should take a bath.
341 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Taking bath on Friday is necessary for every adult.
342 | Narrated Hafsah, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: It is necessary for every adult (person) to go for (saying) Friday (prayer), and for everyone who goes for Friday (prayer) washing is necessary.    Abu Dawud said: If one takes bath after sunrise, even though he washes because of seminal emission, that will be enough for him for his washing on Friday.
343 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone takes a bath on Friday, puts on his best clothes, applies a touch of perfume if has any, then goes to congregational prayer (in the mosque), and takes care not to step over people, then prayer what Allah has prescribes for him, then keeps silent from the time his Imam comes out until he finishes his prayer, it will atone for his sins during the previous week.   Abu Hurairah said: (It will atone for his sins) for three days more. he further said: One is rewarded ten times for doing a good work.   Abu Dawud said: The version narrated by Muhammad b. Salamah is perfect, and Hammad did not make a mention of the statement of Abu Hurairah.
344 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abi Sa'id al-Khudri quotes his father as saying:The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Washing and the use of tooth-stick are necessary for every adult (person) on Friday; and everyone should apply perfume whatever one has. The narrator Bukair did not mention of 'Abd al-Rahman; and about perfume he said that even it might be of the kind used by women.
345 | Narrated Aws ibn Aws ath-Thaqafi:      I heard the apostle of Allah (ﷺ) say: If anyone makes (his wife) wash and he washes himself on Friday, goes out early (for Friday prayer), attends the sermon from the beginning, walking, not riding, takes his seat near the imam, listens attentively, and does not indulge in idle talk, he will get the reward of a year's fasting and praying at night for every step he takes.
346 | Aws al-Thaqafi reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone washes his head on Friday and washes himself; and he narrated the rest of the tradition as above.
347 | 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr al-'As reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:Whoever washed himself on Friday and applies perfume of his wife if she has one, and wears good clothes and does not step over the necks of the people (in the mosque to sit in the front row) and does not indulge in idle talk during the sermon, that will atone (for his sins) between the two Fridays. But he who indulges in idle talk and steps over the necks of people (in the mosque), that (Friday) will be for him like the noon prayer.
348 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) would take a bath because of sexual defilement on Friday, after opening a vein and after washing a dead body.
349 | Makhul was asked about the meaning of words ghassala and ightasala (that occur in tradition 345) and he said:one should was one's head and body well (and not than one should makes one's wife wash).
350 | Explaining the  meaning of the words ghassala and ightasala (that occur in tradition 345) Sa'id (b. 'Abd al-'Aziz) said:One should wash one's head and body well (And not that one should make one's wife wash).
351 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Whoever takes bath due to sexual defilement on Friday and goes out (for Friday prayer), is treated like one who offers a camel as sacrifice; he who goes out in the second instance as one who offers a cow; he who goes out in the third instance is treated as one who offers horned cow ; he who goes out in the fourth instance is treated as one who offers hen ; he who goes out in the fifth instance is treated as one who offers an egg. When the Imam comes out (for sermon), the angels too attend to listen to the sermon.
352 | 'Aishah said:The people (mostly) were workers and they would come for Friday prayer in the same condition, so it was said to them: If only you were to perform Ghusl.
353 | 'Amr b. Abi 'Amr and 'Ikrimah reported:Some people of Iraq came and said: Ibn 'Abbas, do you regard taking a bath on Friday as obligatory ? He said: No, it is only a means of cleanliness, and is better for one who washes oneself. Anyone who does not take a bath, it is not essential for him. I inform you how the bath (on Friday) commenced. The people were poor and used to wear woolen clothes, and would carry loads on their backs. Their mosque was small and its rood was lowered down. It was a sort of trellis of vine. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) once came out on a hot day and the people perspired profusely in the woolen clothes so much so that foul smell emitted from them and it caused trouble to each other. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) found the foul smell, he said: O people, when this day (Friday) comes, you should take bath and every one should anoint the best oil and perfume one has. Ibn 'Abbas then said: Then Allah, the Exalted, provided wealth (to the people) and they wore clothes other than the woolen, and were spared from work, and their mosque became vast. The foul smell that caused trouble to them became non-existent.
354 | Narrated Samurah:      If any one of you performs ablution (on Friday) that is all right; and if any of you takes a bath, that is better.
355 | Narrated Qays ibn Asim:      I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) with the intention of embracing Islam. He commanded me to take a bath with water (boiled with) the leaves of the lote-tree.
356 | 'Uthaim b. Kulaib reported from his father (Kuthair) on the authority of his grandfather (Kulaib) that he came to the Prophet (ﷺ):I have embraced Islam. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: Remove from yourself the hair that grew during of unbelief, saying "shave them". He further says that another person (other than the grandfather of 'Uthaim) reported to him that the Prophet (ﷺ) said to another person who accompanied him: Remove from yourself the hair that grew during the period of unbelief and get yourself circumcised.
357 | Mu'adhah said that 'Aishah was asked about (washing) the clothes of a menstruating woman smeared with blood. She said:She should wash it; in case mark is not removed she should change it by applying some yellow color. I had three menstruations together while I lives with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but I did not wash my clothes.
358 | 'Aishah said:Each of us (wives of the Prophet) had only one clothe in which she would menstruate. Whenever it was smeared with blood, she would moisten it with her saliva and scratch it with saliva.
359 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      Bakkar ibn Yahya said that his grandmother narrated to him: I entered upon Umm Salamah. A woman from the Quraysh asked her about praying with the clothes which a woman wore while she menstruated.        Umm Salamah said: We would menstruate in the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then each one of us refrained (from prayer) during menstrual period. When she was purified, she would look at the clothe in which she menstruated. If it were smeared with blood, we would wash it and pray with it; if there were nothing in it, we would leave it and that would not prevent us from praying with it (the same clothe).       As regards the woman who had plaited hair - sometimes each of us had plaited hair - when she washed, she would not undo the hair. She would instead pour three handfuls of water upon her head. When she felt moisture in the roots of her hair, she would rub them. Then she would pour water upon her whole body.
360 | Asma' daughter of Abu Bakr said:I heard a woman asking the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): What should any of us to with her clothe (in which she menstruated) when she becomes purified ? Can she pray in that (clothe) ? He said: She should see; if she finds blood in it, she should scratch it with some water and (in case of doubt) sprinkle upon it (some water) and pray so long as she does not find (any blood).
361 | Asma' daughter of Abu Bakr said:A woman asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Messenger of Allah, what do you think if the clothe of any of us smeared with the blood of menstruation; what should she do ? He said: If (the clothe of) any of you is smeared with blood of menstruation, she should scratch it; then she should sprinkle water upon it and then she may pray.
362 | This tradition has been transmitted by Hisham through a different chain of narrators to the same effect:Rub it off (with a stone), and then scratch it (with finger) by pouring water, then sprinkle water upon it.
363 | Narrated Umm Qays daughter of Mihsan:      I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about the blood of menstruation on the clothe. He said: Erase it off with a piece of wood and then wash it away with water and the leaves of the lote-tree.
364 | 'Aishah said:One of us would have a shirt in which she would menstruate and in it she became sexually defiled. Then if she ever saw any drop of blood in it, she would rub it off by applying her saliva.
365 | Abu Hurairah reported that Khawlah daughter of Yasar came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said:Messenger of Allah, I have only one clothe and I menstruate in it, how should I do ? He said: When you are purified, wash it and pray in it. She asked: If the blood is not removed, (then what) ? He said: It is enough for you to wash the blood, its mark will not do any harm to you.
366 | Narrated Umm Habibah:      Mu'awiyah ibn AbuSufyan asked his sister Umm Habibah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ): Would the apostle of Allah (ﷺ) pray in the clothe in which he had an intercourse? She said: Yes, when he would not see any impurity in it.
367 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would not pray in our wrappers or in our quilts.       Ubaydullah said: My father (Mu'adh) doubted this.
368 | 'Aishah said:The Prophet (ﷺ) would not in our quilts. Hammad said: I heard Sa'id b. Abi Sadaqah say: I asked Muhammad (b. Sirin) about it. He did not narrate it to me, but said: I heard it a long time ago and I do not know whom I heard it. I do not know whether I heard it from a trustworthy person or not. Make an inquiry about it.
369 | Maimunah reported:The Prophet (ﷺ) prayed on a sheet of cloth put on by one of his wives who was menstruating. He was praying while (a part of) it was upon him.
370 | 'Aishah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would pray at night while I lay by his side during my menstrual period. A sheet of cloth would be partly on me and partly on him.
371 | Hammam b. al-Harith reported, he has a sexual dream when he was staying with 'Aishah. The slave girl of 'Aishah saw him while he was washing the mark of defilement, or he was washing his clothe. She informed 'Aishah who said:He witnessed me rubbing off the semen from the clothe of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).   Abu Dawud said: Al-A'mash narrated it as narrated by al-Hakam.
372 | 'Aishah reported:I used to rub off the semen from the clothe of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He would would pray in it.   Abu Dawud said: Mughirah, Abu Ma'shar, and Wasil also narrated it to the same effect.
373 | Sulaiman b. Yasar reported:I heard 'Aishah say that she would wash semen from the clothe of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She added: Then I would see a mark or marks (after washing).
374 | Umm Qais daughter of Mihsan reported that she came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with her little son who had not attained the age of eating food. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) seated him in his lap, and he urinated on his clothe. He sent for water and sprayed it (over his clothe) and did not wash it.
375 | Narrated Lubabah daughter of al-Harith:      Al-Husayn ibn Ali was (sitting) in the lap of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He passed water on him. I said: Put on (another) clothe, and give me your wrapper to wash. He said: The urine of a female child should be washed (thoroughly) and the urine of a male child should be sprinkled over.
376 | Narrated AbusSamh:      I used to serve the Prophet (ﷺ). Whenever he intended to wash himself, he would say: Turn your back towards me, So I would turn my back and hide him. (Once) Hasan or Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them) was brought to him and he passed water on his chest. I came to wash it. He said: It is only the urine of a female which should be washed; the urine of a male should be sprinkled over.     'Abbas (a narrator) said: Yahya b. al-Walid narrated the tradition to us. Abu Dawud said: He (Yahya) is Abu al-Za'ra'. Harun b. Tamim said on the authority of al-Hasan: All sorts of urine are equal.
377 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The urine of a female (child) should be washed and the urine of a male (child) should be sprinkled  over until the age of eating.
378 | 'Ali b. Abi Talib reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:He narrated the tradition to the same effect, but he did not mention the words "until the age of eating". This version adds: Qatadah said: This is valid until the time they do not eat food; when they begin to eat, their urine should be washed.
379 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      Al-Hasan reported on the authority of his mother that she was Umm Salamah pouring water on the urine of the male child until the age when he did not eat food. When he began to eat food, she would wash (his urine). And she would wash the urine of the female child.
380 | Abu Hurairah reported:A bedouin entered the	mosque while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting. He offered two rak'ahs of prayer, according to the version of Ibn 'Abdah. He then said: O Allah, have mercy on me and on Muhammad and do not have mercy on anyone along with us. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: You have narrowed down (a thing) that was broader. After a short while he passed a water in the corner of the mosque. The people rushed towards him. The Prophet (ﷺ) prevented them and said: You have been sent to facilitate and not create difficulties. Pour a bucket of water upon it.
381 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Ma'qil ibn Muqarrin:      A bedouin prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ). He then narrated the tradition (No 0380) about urinating of that bedouin.       This version adds: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Remove the earth where he urinated and throw it away and pour water upon the place.    Abu Dawud said: This is a mursal tradition (i.e. the narrator quotes the Prophet (ﷺ) directly, although he did not see him). Ibn Ma'qil did not see the Prophet (ﷺ).
382 | Ibn 'Umar said:I used to sleep in the mosque in the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when I was young and bachelor. The dogs would urinate frequently visit the mosque, and no one would sprinkle over it.
383 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      The slave-mother of Ibrahim ibn AbdurRahman ibn Awf asked Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ): I am a woman having a long border of clothe and I walk in filthy place; (then what should I do?). Umm Salamah replied: The Messenger of Allah ( peace be upon him) said: What comes after it cleanses it.
384 | Narrated A woman of the Banu AbdulAshhal:      She reported: I said Messenger of Allah, our road to the mosque has an unpleasant stench; what should we do when it is raining? He asked: Is there not a cleaner part after the filthy part of the road? She replied: Why not (there is one)! He said: It makes up for the other.
385 | Abu Hurairah reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you treads with his sandal upon an unclean place, the earth will render it purified.
386 | Abu Hurairah reported the tradition to the same effect from the Prophet (ﷺ):When any of you treads with his shoes upon something unclean, they will be purified with the earth.
387 | 'Aishah reported a similar tradition from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
388 | Umm Jahdar al-'Amiriyyah said that she asked 'Aishah about the blood of menses which drops on the clothe. She replied:I was (lying) with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we had our garment over us, and we had put a blanket over it. When the day broke, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took the blanket, wore it and went out and offered the dawn prayer. He then sat (in the mosque among the people). A man said: Messenger of Allah, this is a spot of blood. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) caught hold of it from around and sent it to me folded in the hand of a slave and said: Wash it and dry it and then send it to me. I sent for my vessel and washed it. I then dried it and returned it to him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came at noon while he had the blanket over him.
389 | Narrated AbuNadrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spat on his clothe and scrubbed with a part of it.
390 | A similar tradition has also been narrated by Anas from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators.
391 | Talhah b. 'Ubaid Allah said:A man from among the people of Najd with disheveled hair came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The humming sound of his voice could be heard but what he was saying could not be understood. He came closer and it was then known that he was asking about Islam. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Five times of prayer each day and night: He asked: Must I observe any more than them? He replied: No, unless you do it voluntarily. He (Talhah) said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned fasting during the month of Ramadan. He asked: Must I observe anything else? He replied: No, unless you do it voluntarily. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned Zakat to him. He asked: Must I pay anything else? He replied: No, unless you do it voluntarily. The man then turned away saying: I swear by Allah, I shall not add anything to this or fall short of it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The man will be successful if he speaks truth.
392 | This tradition has also been reported by Abu Suhail Nafi' b. Malik b. Abi 'Amir through a different chain of narrators. It adds:He will be successful, by his father, if he speaks the truth; he will enter Paradise, by his father, if he speaks the truth.
393 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Gabriel (ﷺ) led me in prayer at the House (i.e. the Ka'bah). He prayed the noon prayer with me when the sun had passed the meridian to the extent of the thong of a sandal; he prayed the afternoon prayer with me when the shadow of everything was as long as itself; he prayed the sunset prayer with me when one who is fasting breaks the fast; he prayed the night prayer with me when the twilight had ended; and he prayed the dawn prayer with me when food and drink become forbidden to one who is keeping the fast.        On the following day he prayed the noon prayer with me when his shadow was as long as himself; he prayed the afternoon prayer with me when his shadow was twice as long as himself; he prayed the sunset prayer at the time when one who is fasting breaks the fast; he prayed the night prayer with me when about the third of the night had passed; and he prayed the dawn prayer with me when there was a fair amount of light.        Then turning to me he said: Muhammad, this is the time observed by the prophets before you, and the time is anywhere between two times.
394 | Ibn Shihab said:'Umar b. 'Abdul 'Aziz was sitting on the pulpit and he somewhat postponed the afternoon prayer. 'Urwah b. al-Zubair said to him: "Gabriel informed Muhammed (ﷺ) of the time of prayer". So 'Umar said to him: "Be sure of what you are saying". 'Urwah then replied: "I heard Bashir b. Abu Mas'ud say that he heard Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari say that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)	say: 'Gabriel came down and informed me of the time of prayer, and I prayed along with him, then prayed along with him, then I prayed along with him,  then I prayed along with him, then I prayed along with him, reckoning with his fingers five times of the prayer.' I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offering the Duhr prayer when the sun had passed the meridian. Sometimes he would delay it when it was sever heat ; and I witnessed that he prayer the 'Asr prayer when the sun was high and bright before the yellowness had overcome it; then a man could go off after the prayer and reach Dhu'l-Hulaifah before the sunset, and he would pray Maghrib when the sun had set ; and he would pray the 'Isha prayer when darkness prevailed over the horizon; sometime he would delay it until the people assembled; and once he prayer the fair prayer in the darkness of dawn and at another time he prayed it when it became fairly light; but later on he continued to pray in the darkness of dawn until his death; he never prayed it again in the light of the dawn."   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted from al-Zuhri by Ma'mar, Malik, Ibn 'Uyainah, Shu'aib b. Abi Hamzah, and al-Laith b. Sa'd and others; but they did not mention the time in which he (the Prophet) had prayer, nor did they explain it. And similarly it has been narrated by Hisham b. 'Urwah and Habib b. Abu Mazruq from 'Urwah like the report of Ma'mar and his companions. But Habib did not make a mention of Bashir. And Wahb b. Kaisan reported on the authority of Jabir from the Prophet (ﷺ) the time of the Maghrib prayer. He said: "Next day he (Gabriel) came to him at the time of the Maghrib prayer when the sun had already set. (He came both days) at the same time."   Abu Dawud said: Similarly, this tradition has been transmitted by Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: "Then he (Gabriel) led me in the sunset prayer next day at the same time."   Similarly, this tradition has been narrated through a different chain by 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr b. al-'As, through a chain from Hassan b. 'Atiyyah, from 'Amr b. Shu'aib, from his father, on the authority from the Prophet (ﷺ).
395 | Abu Musa reported:A man asked the Prophet (ﷺ) [about the prayer times] but he did reply to him but he commanded Bilal, who made the announcement for the beginning of the time of the the fair prayer prayer when the dawn broke. He offered (the fair prayer) when a man (due to darkness) could not recognize the face of his companion ; or a man could not know the person who stood by his side. He then commanded Bilal who made announcement for the beginning of the time of the Zuhr prayer when the sun had passed the meridian until some said: Has the noon come ? While he (the Prophet) knew (the time) well. He the commanded Bilal who announced the beginning of the time of the 'Asr prayer when the sun was white and high. When the sunset he commanded Bilal who announced beginning of the time of the Maghrib prayer. When the twilight disappeared he commanded Bilal who announced the beginning of the Isha prayer.	 Next day he offered the Fajr prayer and returned until we said: Has the sun rise ? He observed the Zuhr prayer at the time he has previously observed the 'Asr prayer. He offered the 'Asr prayer at the time when the sun had become yellow or the evening had come. He offered the Maghrib prayer before the twilight had ended. He observed the Isha prayer when a third of the night had passed. He then asked: Where is the man who was asking me about the time of prayer. (Then replying to him he said): The time (of your prayer) lies within these two limits. 					   Abu Dawud said: Sulaiman b. Musa has narrated this tradition about the time of the Maghrib prayer from Musa from 'Ata on the authority of Jabir from the Prophet (ﷺ). This version adds: He then offered the Isha prayer when a third of the night had passed, as narrated (he said the Isha prayer) when half the night had passed.   This tradition has been transmitted by Ibn Buraidah on the authority of his father from the Prophet (ﷺ) in a similar way.
396 | 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:The time of the Zuhr prayer is as along as the time of the 'Asr prayer has not come; the time of the Asr prayer is as long as the sun has not become yellow ; the time of the Maghrib prayer is as long as the twilight has not ended; the time of the Isha prayer is up to midnight; and the time of the Fajr prayer is as long as the sun has not risen.
397 | Muhammad b. 'Amr b. al-Hasan reported:We asked Jabir about the time of the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: He used to offer the Zuhr prayer in the midday heat, the 'Asr prayer when the sun was bright, the Maghrib prayer when the sun had completely set, the Isha prayer early when many people were present, but late if there were few, and the Fajr prayer in the darkness (of the dawn).
398 | Abu Barzah reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would offer the Zuhr prayer when the sun had passed the meridian; he would offer 'Asr prayer after which one of us would visit the skirts of Medina and return him while the sun was still bright; I forgot what he said about the Maghrib prayer; he did not fear postponing the Isha prayer until a third of night had passed, or he said: until the midnight had passed. He would dislike sleeping before it or talking after it. And he would offer the Fajr prayer when a man could recognize his neighbor whom he recognized well; and he would recite from sixty to a hundred verses during it.
399 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      I would offer my noon prayer with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and took a handful of gravels so that they might become cold in my hand and I placed them (before me) so that I may put my forehead on them at the time when I would prostrate. I did this due to the intensity of heat.
400 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The extent of the shadow when the Messenger of Allah prayed (the noon prayer) was three to five feet in summer and five to seven feet in winter.
401 | Abu Dharr said:We were in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ). The mu'adhdhin intended to call for the Zuhr prayer. He said: Make it cooler. He then intended to call for prayer. He said twice or thrice: Make it cooler. We then witnessed the shadow of the mounds. He then said: The intensity of heat comes from the bubbling over of the Hell ; so when the heat is violent, offer (the Zuhr) prayer when it becomes cooler.
402 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:When the heat is violent, offer (the Zuhr) prayer when it becomes fairly cool, for the violent heat comes from the bubbling over the Hell.
403 | Jabir b. Samurah reported that Bilal used to call for the noon prayer when the sun had declined.
404 | Anas b. Malik said the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say the 'Asr prayer when the sun was high and bright and living, then one would go off to al-'Awali and get there while the sun was still high.
405 | Al-Zuhri said:Al-'Awali is situated at a distance of two miles or three (from Medina). He (the narrator) said: I think he said: or four miles.
406 | Khaythamah said:By the life of the sun is meant that you may find heat in it.
407 | 'Aishah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would offer the Zuhr prayer while the sunlight was present in her apartment before it ascended (the walls).
408 | Narrated Ali ibn Shayban:      We came upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in Medina. He would postpone the afternoon prayer as long as the sun remained white and clear.
409 | 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying on the day of Battle of Khandaq (Trench). They (the unbelievers) prevented us from offering the middle prayer i.e. 'Asr prayer. May Allah fill their houses and their graves with Hell-fire.
410 | Abu Yunus, the freed slave of 'Aishah said:'Aishah commanded me to write for her come passage from the Qur'an. She also added: When you reach the following verse, inform me: "Be guardian of your prayers and of the midmost prayer" (2:238). When I reached it, I informed her. She asked me to write: "Be guardians of your prayers, and of the midmost prayer, and of the 'Asr prayer, and stand up with devotion of Allah" (2:238). 'Aishah then said: I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
411 | Zaid b. Thabit said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to offer the Zuhr prayer in midday heat; and no prayer was harder on the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that this one. Hence the revelation came down: "Be guardians of your prayers, and of the midmost prayer" (2:238). He (the narrator) said: There are two prayers before it and two prayers after it.
412 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone says a rak'ah of the 'Asr prayer before sunset, he has observed (the 'Asr prayer), and if anyone performs a rak'ah of the Fajr prayer, he has observed (the Fajr prayer).
413 | 'Ala b. 'Abd al-Rahman said:We came upon Anas b. Malik after the Zuhr prayer. He stood for saying the 'Asr prayer. When he became free from praying, we mentioned to him about observing prayer in its early period or he himself mentioned it. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: This is how hypocrites pray, this is how hypocrites pray, this is how hypocrites pray: He sits (watching the sun), and when it becomes yellow and is between the horns of the devil, or is on the horns of the devil, he rises and prays for rak'ahs quickly, remembering Allah only seldom during them.
414 | Ibn 'Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Anyone who loses his 'Asr prayer is like a person whose family has perished and whose property has been plundered.   Abu Dawud said: 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar narrated the word utira (instead of wutira, meaning perished). The dispute on this point goes back to Ayyub. Al-Zuhri reported from Salim on the authority of this father from the Prophet (ﷺ) the word 'wutira'.
415 | Al-Awza'i said:Delaying the 'Asr prayer means that the sunshine becomes yellow on the earth.
416 | Anas b. Malik said:We used to offer the Maghrib prayer with the Prophet (ﷺ) and then shoot arrows, one of us could see the place where arrow would fall.
417 | Salamah b. al-Akwa' said:The Prophet (ﷺ) used to say the Maghrib prayer immediately after the sun had set when its upper side would disappear.
418 | Narrated AbuAyyub:      Marthad ibn Abdullah said: When AbuAyyub came upon us to fight the infidels and in those days Uqbah ibn Amir was the Governor of Egypt, he (Uqbah) delayed the sunset prayer. Hence AbuAyyub stood and said: What kind of prayer is this, Uqbah? He said: We were busy. He said: Did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: My community will remain well, or he said: will remain on its natural condition, so long as it would not delay the evening prayer until the stars shine brightly just like a network.
419 | Narrated An-Nu'man ibn Bashir:      I am the one who is best informed of the time of this prayer, i.e. the night prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to offer it at the hour when the moon went down on its third night.
420 | 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar said:We remained one night waiting for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to offer the Isha prayer. He came out to us when one-third of the night has passed or even after it. We did not know whether anything kept him occupied or there was some other matter. When he came out, he said: Are you waiting for this prayer ? Were it not that it would impose a burden on my people, I would normally pray with them at this time. He then gave orders to the mu'adhdhin who declared that the time of the prayer had come.
421 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      We waited for the Prophet (ﷺ) to offer the night prayer. He delayed until people thought that he would not come out and some of us said that he had offered the prayer. At the moment when we were in this condition the Prophet (ﷺ) came out. People said to him as they were already saying. He said: Observe this prayer when it is dark, for by it you have been made superior to all the peoples, no people having observed it before you.
422 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      We observed the prayer after nightfall with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he did not come out till about half the night had passed. He then said: Take your places. We then took our places. Then he said: The people have prayed and gone to bed, but you are still engaged in prayer as long as you wait for the prayer. Were it not for the weakness of the weak and for  the sickness of the sick. I would delay this prayer till half the night had gone.
423 | 'Aishah reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would say the Fajr prayer after which the women would depart wrapped up their woolen garments, being unrecognizable because of the darkness before dawn.
424 | Rafi' b. Khadij reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Offer Fajr prayer at dawn, for it is most productive of rewards to you or most productive of reward.
425 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Sunabihi:      AbuMuhammad fancies that witr prayer is essential. (Hearing this) Ubadah ibn as-Samit said: AbuMuhammad was wrong. I bear witness that I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Allah, the Exalted, has made five prayers obligatory. If anyone performs ablution for them well, offers them at their (right) time, and observes perfectly their bowing and submissiveness in them, it is the guarantee of Allah that He will pardon him; if anyone does not do so, there is no guarantee for him on the part of Allah; He may pardon him if He wills, and punish him if He wills.
426 | Narrated Umm Farwah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked: Which of the actions is best? He replied: Observing prayer early in its period.       Al-Khuza'i narrated in his version from his aunt named Umm Farwah who took the oath of allegiance to the Prophet (ﷺ): He was questioned.
427 | Narrated Umarah ibn Ruwaybah:      A man from Basrah said: Tell me what you heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: No one will enter Hell who has prayed before the rising of the sun and before its setting (meaning the dawn and the afternoon prayers). He said three times: Have you heard it from him? He replied: Yes, each time saying: My ears heard it and my heart memorised it. The man then said: And I heard him (the Prophet) say that.
428 | Narrated Fudalah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught me and what he taught me is this: Observe the five prayers regularly. He said: I told (him): I have many works at these times; so give me a comprehensive advice which, if I follow, should be enough for me. He said: Observe the two afternoon prayers (al-asrayn). But the term al-asrayn (two afternoon prayers) was not used in our language. Hence I said: What is al-asrayn?  He said: A prayer before the sunrise and a prayer before the sunset (i.e. the dawn and the afternoon prayers).
429 | Abu al-Darda' reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:There are five thing, if anyone observe them with faith, he will enter Paradise. He who prays the five times prayer regularly, with the ablution for them, with their bowing, with their prostration and their (right) times ; keeps fast during Ramadan ; performs Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House (Ka'bah), provided he has the ability for its passage; pays Zakat happily ; and fulfills the trust (he will enter Paradise). People said: Abu al-Darda', what is fulfilling the trust ? He replied: Washing because of sexual defilement.
430 | Narrated Abu Qatadah ibn Rib'iyy:      Allah , the Exalted said: I made five times' prayers obligatory on your people, and I took a guarantee that if anyone observes them regularly at their times, I shall admit him to Paradise; if anyone does not offer them regularly, there is no such guarantee of Mine for him.
431 | Abu Dharr said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked me: 'How will you act, Abu Dharr, when you are under rulers who kill prayer or delay it (beyond its proper time) ?' I said: 'Messenger of Allah, what do you command me ?' He replied: 'Offer the prayer at its proper time, and if you say it along with them, say it, for it will be a supererogatory prayer for you.'"
432 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      Amr ibn Maymun al-Awdi said: Mu'adh ibn Jabal, the Messenger of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us in Yemen, I heard his takbir (utterance of AllahuAkbar) in the dawn prayer. He was a man with loud voice. I began to love him. I did depart from him until I buried him dead in Syria (i.e. until his death).        Then I searched for a person who had deep understanding in religion amongst the people after him. So I came to Ibn Mas'ud and remained in his company until his death. He (Ibn Mas'ud) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: How will you act when you are ruled by rulers who say prayer beyond its proper time? I said: What do you command me, Messenger of Allah, if I witness such a time? He replied: Offer the prayer at its proper time and also say your prayer along with them as a supererogatory prayer.
433 | Narrated Ubadah ibn as-Samit:      After me you will come under rulers who will be detained from saying prayer at its proper time by (their) works until its time has run out, so offer prayer at its proper time. A man asked him: Messenger of Allah, may I offer prayer with them? He replied: Yes, if you wish (to do so).       Sufyan (another narrator through a different chain)said: May I offer prayer with them if I get it with them? He said: Yes, if you wish to do so.
434 | Narrated Qabisah ibn Waqqas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: After me you will be ruled by rulers who will delay the prayer and it will be to your credit but to their discredit. So pray with them so long as they pray facing the qiblah.
435 | Abu Hurairah reported:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned from the Battle of Khaibar, he travelled during the night. When we felt sleep, he halted for rest. Addressing Bilal he said: Keep vigilance at night for us. But Bilal who was leaning against the saddle of his mount was dominated by sleep. Neither the Prophet (ﷺ) nor Bilal nor any of his Companions could get up till the sunshine struck them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up first of all. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was embarrassed and said: O Bilal ! He replied: He who detained your soul, detained my soul, Messenger of Allah, my parents be sacrificed for you. Then they drove their mounts to a little distance. The Prophet (ﷺ) perfumed ablution and commanded Bilal who made announcement for the prayer. He (the Prophet) led them in the Fajr prayer. When he finished prayer, he said: If anyone forget saying prayer, he should observe it when he recalls it, for Allah has said (in the Qur'an): "Establish prayer for my remembrance". Yunus said: Ibn Shihab used to recite this verse in a similar way (i.e. instead of reciting the word li-dhikri - for the sake of My remembrance - he would recite li-dhikra - when you remember). Ahmad (one of the narrator) said: 'Anbasah (a reporter) reported on the authority of Yunus the word li-dhikri (for the sake of my remembrance). Ahmad said: The word nu'as (occurring in this tradition) means "drowsiness".
436 | Abu Hurairah reported:Another version of the above tradition adds: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Go away from this place of yours where inadvertence took hold of you. He then commanded Bilal who called for prayer and announced that the prayer in congregation was ready (i.e. he uttered the iqamah) and he observed prayer.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Malik, Sufyan b. 'Uyainah, al-Awza'i, and 'Abd al-Razzaq from Ma'mar and Ibn Ishaq, none of them made a mention of the call for prayer (adman) in this version of the tradition narrated by al-Zuhri, and none of them attribute (this tradition) to him except al-Awza'i and Aban al-'Attar on the authority of Ma'mar.
437 | Abu Qatadah reported:"The Prophet (ﷺ) was on a journey. The Prophet (ﷺ) took a turn and I also took a turn with him. He said: 'Look!' I said: 'This is a rider; these are two riders; and these are three' until we became seven. He then said: Guard for us our prayer, i.e. the Fajr prayer. But sleep dominated them and none could awaken them except the heat of the sun. They stood up and drove away a little. Then they got down (from their mounts) and performed ablution. Bilal called for prayer and they offered two rak'ahs of (Sunnah) of Fajr and then offered the Fajr prayer and mounted (their mounts). Some of them said to others: We showed negligence in prayer. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no negligence in sleep. The negligence is in wakefulness. If any of you forget saying prayer, he should offer it when he remembers it and next day (he should say it) at its proper time.
438 | Khalid b. Sumair said:'Abd Allah b. Rabah al-Ansari, whom the Ansar called faqih (juries), came to us from Medina, and reported us on the authority of Abu Qatadah al-Ansari, the horseman of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent a military expedition consisting of the chief Companions. He then narrated the same story, saying Nothing awakened us except the rising sun. We stoop up in bewilderment, for our prayer. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Wait a little, wait a little. When the sun rose high, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Those who sued to observer the two rak'ahs of Fajr prayer (sunnah prayer before obligatory prayer) should observe them. Then those who used to observe and those who would not observe stood up and said prayer. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded to call for prayer; the call for prayer was made accordingly. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood and led us in prayer. When he turned away (from the prayer) he said: We thank Allah for the fact that we were not engaged in any wordily affairs which detained us from our prayer. Instead our souls were in the hands of Allah. He released them whenever He wished. If any one of you gets morning prayer tomorrow at its proper time, he should offer a similar prayer as an atonement.
439 | This tradition has also been reported by Abu Qatadah through a different chain of narrators. He said (that the Prophet (ﷺ) said):"Allah takes your souls as He wishes, and returns them as He wishes. Stand up and call the Adhan to prayer." They (the Companions) stood and performed ablution. When the sun rose high, the Prophet (ﷺ) stood and led the people in prayer.
440 | This tradition has been transmitted through a different chain by Abu Qatadah to the same effect. This version adds:"He performed ablution when the sun had arisen high and led them in prayer."
441 | Abu Qatadah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:There is no remissness in sleep, it is only when one is awake that there is remissness when you delay saying the prayer till the time for the next prayer comes.
442 | Anas b. Malik reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:If any one forgets a prayer or oversleeps, he should observe it when he remembers it ; there is no expiation for it except that.
443 | 'Imran b. Husain said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was on his journey. They (the people) slept abandoning the Fajr prayer. They awoke by the heat of the sun. Then they travelled a little until the sun rose high. He (the Prophet) commanded the mu'adhdhin (one who called for prayer) to call for prayer. He then offered two rak'ahs of prayer (sunnah prayer) before the (obligatory) fajr prayer. Then he (the mu'adhdhin) announced for saying the prayer in congregation (i.e. he uttered iqamah). Then he led them in the morning prayer.
444 | Narrated Amr ibn Umayyah ad-Damri:      We were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during one of his journeys. He overslept abandoning the morning prayer until the sun had arisen. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) awoke and said: Go away from this place.       He then commanded Bilal to call for prayer. He called for prayer. They (the people) performed ablution and offered two rak'ahs of the morning prayer (sunnah prayer). He then commanded Bilal (to utter the iqamah, i.e. to summon the people to attend the prayer). He announced the prayer (i.e. uttered the iqamah) and he led them in the morning prayer.
445 | Dhu Mikhbar al-Habashi, who used to serve the Prophet (ﷺ), reported a version of the previous tradition. The Prophet (ﷺ) performed ablution in such a way that there is no mud on the earth. He then commanded Bilal (to call for prayer). He called for prayer. The Prophet (ﷺ) stood and offered two rak'ahs of prayer unhurriedly.   This is narrated by Hajjaj on the authority of Yazid b. Sulaih from Dhu Mikhbar from a person of al-Habashah (Ethiopia). 'Ubaid (a narrator) said:Yazid b. Salih (instead of Yazid b. Sulaih).
446 | This tradition has also been transmitted through another chain of narrators by Dhu Mikhbar, the nephew of the Negus. This version adds:"He (Bilal) called for prayer unhurriedly."
447 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      We proceeded with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the occasion of al-Hudaybiyyah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who will keep watch for us? Bilal said: I (shall do). The overslept till the sun arose. The Prophet (ﷺ) awoke and said: Do as you used to do (i.e. offer prayer as usual). Then we did accordingly. He said: Anyone who oversleeps or forgets (prayer) should do similarly.
448 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      I was not commanded to build high mosques. Ibn Abbas said: You will certainly adorn them as the Jews and Christians did.
449 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The Last Hour will not come until people vie with one another about mosques.
450 | Narrated Uthman ibn Abul'As:      The Prophet (nay peace be upon him) commanded him to build a mosque at Ta'if where the idols were placed.
451 | 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar reported:The mosque (of the Prophet) during his lifetime was built with bricks, its roof with branches of the palm-tree, and its pillars with palm-wood, as Mujahid said: Abu Bakr did not add anything to it. But 'Umar added to it; he built as it was built during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with bricks and branches, and he changed its pillars. Mujahid said: Its pillars were made of wood. 'Uthman changed it altogether with increasing addition. He built its walls with decorated stone and lime. And he built the pillars with decorated stone and its roof with teak. Mujahid said: Its roof was made of teak.  	 Abu Dawud said: Al-Qassah means lime used as mortar.
452 | Ibn 'Umar reported:The pillars of the mosque of the Prophet (ﷺ) during the life time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) were made of the trunks of the palm-tree; they covered from the above by twigs of the palm-tree; they decayed during the caliphate of Abu Bakr. He built it afresh with trunks and twigs of the palm-tree. But they again decayed during the caliphate of 'Uthman. He, therefore, built it with bricks. That survives until today.
453 | Anas b. Malik reported:Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came over to Medina and encamped at the upper side of Medina among the tribe known as Banu 'Amr b. 'Awf. He stayed among them for fourteen days. He then sent someone to call Banu al-Najjar. They came to him hanging their swords from the necks. Anas then said: As if I am looking at the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sitting on his mount and Abu Bakr seated behind him, and Banu al-Najjar standing around him. He descended in the courtyard of Abu Ayyub. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would say his prayer in the folds of the sheep and goats. He commanded us to build a mosque. He then sent for Banu al-Najjar and said to them: Banu al-Najjar, sell this land of yours to me for some price. They replied: By Allah, we do not want any price (from you) except from Allah. Anas said: I tell what this land contained. It contained the graves of the disbelievers, dung-hills, and some trees of date-palm. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded and the graves of the disbelievers were dug open, and the trees of the date-palm were cut off. The wood of the date-palm were erected in front of the mosque ; the door-steps wre built of stone. They were reciting verses carrying the stones. The Prophet (ﷺ) also joined them (in reciting verses) saying: O Allah, there is no good except the good of the Hereafter. So grant you aid to the Ansar and the Muhajirah.
454 | Anas b. Malik said:The Mosque (of the Prophet) was built in the land of Banu al-Najjar which contained crops, palm trees and graves of the disbelievers. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Sell it to me for some price. They (Banu al-Najjar) replied: We do not want (any price). The palm-trees were cut off, and the crops removed and the graves of the disbelievers dug opened. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. But this version has the word "forgive" in the verse, instead of the word "help". Musa said: 'Abd al-Warith also narrated this tradition in a like manner. The version of 'Abd al-Warith has the word "dung-hill" (instead of crop), and he asserted that he narrated this tradition to Hammad.
455 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to build mosques in different localities (i.e. in the locality of each tribe separately)  and that they should be kept clean and be perfumed.
456 | Samurah reported that he wrote (a letter) to his sons:After (praising Allah and blessing the Prophet) that: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to command us to build mosques in our localities and keep them well and clean.
457 | Narrated Maymunah ibn Sa'd:      I said: Messenger of Allah, tell us the legal injunction about (visiting) Bayt al-Muqaddas (the dome of the Rock at Jerusalem). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: go and pray there. All the cities at that time were effected by war. If you cannot visit it and pray there, then send some oil to be used in the lamps.
458 | Abu al-Walid said:I asked Ibn 'Umar about the gravel spread pin the mosque. He replied: One night the rain fell and the earth was moistened. A man was bringing the gravel (broken stones) in his cloth and spreading it beneath him. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he said: How fine it is !
459 | Abu Salih said:It was said that when a man removed gravels from the mosque, they adjured him.
460 | Abu Hurairah reported (Abu Bakr said that in his opinion he narrated this tradition from the Prophet):The gravels adjure the person when removes them from the mosque.
461 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The rewards of my people were presented before me, so much so that even the reward for removing a mote by a person from the mosque was presented to me. The sins of my people were also presented before me. I did not find a sin greater than that of a person forgetting the Qur'anic chapter or verse memorised by him.
462 | Ibn 'Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:If we left this door for women (it would have been better). Nafi' said: Ibn 'Umar did not enter (the door) until his death. The other except 'Abd al-Warith said: This was said by 'Umar (and not by Ibn 'Umar) and that is more correct.
463 | This tradition has been reported by 'Umar b. al-Khattab through a different chain of narrators. He narrated it to the same effect and that is more correct.
464 | Nafi said :‘Umar b. al-Khattab used to prohibit (men) to enter through the door reserved for women.
465 | Abu Usaid al-Ansari reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying:when any of you enters the mosque he should invoke blessing on the prophet (ﷺ) and then he should say: O Allah, open to me the gates of thy mercy. And when he goes out, he should say: O Allah, I ask thee out of Thine abundance.
466 | Haiwah b. Shuraih reported :I met ‘Uqbah b. Muslim and said to him: it has been reported to me that someone has narrated to you from the prophet (ﷺ) that when he entered the mosque, he would say: I seek refuge in Allah, the Magnificent, and in His noble face, and in his eternal domain, from the accursed Devil. He asked : is it so much only? I said: Yes. He said: when anyone says so. The devil says: he is protected from me all the day long.
467 | Abu Qatadah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying; when any one of you enters the mosque, he should pray two RAKAHS before sitting down.
468 | This tradition has been narrated by Abu Qatadah through a different chain of transmitters to the same effect from the prophet (ﷺ). This version adds:then he may remain sitting (after praying two RAKAHS) or may go for his work.
469 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying; The angels invoke blessings on any of you who remains sitting at the place where he says his prayers so long as he is defiled (needs ablution) or stands up, saying:O Allah, forgives him; O Allah, have mercy on him.
470 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying; one is considered to be at prayer so long as one is detained by prayer:Nothing prevents one from going home to one’s family except prayer.
471 | Abu Hurairah reported the apostle of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying; The servant (of Allah) is considered to he at prayer so long as he remains at the place of prayer waiting for prayer. The angels say:O Allah, forgive him? O Allah, take mercy on him, until he turns away, or he is defiled. He was asked: what is meant by defilement? He replied: he breaks wind gently or loudly.
472 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying; one shall have the thing the for which one comes to the mosque.
473 | Abu Hurairah reported:I heard the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying; if anyone hears a man crying out in the mosque about something he has lost, he should say: May Allah not restore it to you, for the mosque were not built for this.
474 | Anas b. Malik reported the Prophet(ﷺ) as saying:Spitting in the mosque is a sin and it is expiated by burying the spittle.
475 | Anas reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Spitting in the mosque is a sin and it is expiated by burying the spittle.
476 | Anas b. Malik reported:The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said: Spitting phlegm in the mosque... The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition to the same effect.
477 | Abu Hurairah reported:The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said: if anyone enters the mosque, and spits in it, or ejects phlegm, he should remove some earth and bury it there. If he does not do so, then he should spit in his clothes and not come out with it.
478 | Narrated Abdullah al-Muharibi:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: When a man stands with the intention of saying prayer, or if any of you says prayer, he should not spit before him, nor at his right side; but he should do so at his left side, if there is a place for it; or he should spit under his left foot and then rub it off.
479 | Ibn ‘Umar reported:One day while the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ)was giving sermon he suddenly saw phlegm on the wall towards the qiblah(the direction to which Muslims turn in prayer) of the mosque. So he became angry at people. He then scraped it and sent for saffron and stained with it. He then said: When any one of you prays, Allah, the Exalted, faces him: he, therefore, should not spit before him.
480 | Abu Sa’id al-khudri said:The Prophet(ﷺ) liked the twigs of the date-palm, and he often had one of them in his hand. He entered the mosque and saw phlegm in the wall towards qiblah and he scraped it. He then turned towards people in anger and said: Is any one of you is pleased to spit in his face? When any of you faces qiblah, he indeed faces his Lord, the Majestic the Glorious: the angels are at right side. Therefore, he should not spit on his right side or before him towards qiblah. He should spit towards his left side or beneath his foot. If he is in a hurry, he should do so-and-so. Describing it Ibn ‘Ajlan said: He should spit in his cloth and fold a part of it over the other.
481 | Narrated AbuSahlah as-Sa'ib ibn Khallad:      A man led the people in prayer. He spat towards qiblah while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was looking at him. The Messenger of Allah said to the people when he finished his prayer: He should not lead you in prayer (henceforth).        Thenceforth he intended to lead them in prayer, but they forbade him and informed him of the prohibition of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who said to him: Yes.       The narrator said: I think he (the Prophet) said: You did harm to Allah and His Apostle.
482 | Abu al-‘Ala’ reported on the authority of his father:I came to the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) who was saying prayer. He spat beneath his left foot.
483 | Abu al-‘Ala’ reported this tradition on the authority of his father to the same effect with a different chain of narrators. This version adds:“He then rubbed it with his shoe."
484 | Narrated Wathilah ibn al-Asqa':      AbuSa'id said: I saw Wathilah ibn al-Asqa' in the mosque of Damascus. He spat at the mat and then rubbed it with his foot. He was asked: Why did you do so? He said: Because I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) doing so.
485 | Narrated Ubadah ibn as-Samit:      We came to Jabir ibn Abdullah  who was sitting in his mosque. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us in this mosque and he had a twig of date-palm of the kind of Ibn Tab. He looked and saw phlegm on the wall towards qiblah. He turned to it and scraped it with the twig.       He then said: Who of you likes that Allah turns His face from him? He further said: When any of you stands for praying, Allah faces him. So he should not spit before him, nor on his right side. He should spit on his left side under his left foot. If he is in a hurry (i.e. forced to spit immediately), he should do with his cloth in this manner. He then placed the cloth on his mouth and rubbed it off.       He then said: Bring perfume. A young man of the tribe stood and hurried to his house and returned with perfume in his palm. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took it and put it at the end of the twig. He then stained the mark of phlegm with it.       Jabir said: This is the reason you use perfume in your mosques.
486 | Anas b. Malik reported :A man entered the mosque on camel and made it kneel down, and then tied his leg with rope. He then asked: Who among you is Muhammad? The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was sitting leaning upon something among them. We said to him: This white (man) who is leaning. The man said: O son of ‘Abd al-Muttalib. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said; I already responded to you. The man (again) said: O Muhammad. I am asking you. The narrator then narrated the rest of the tradition.
487 | Ibn ‘Abbas reported :Banu Sa’d b. Bakr sent Qamam b. Tha’labah to the apostle of Allah (May peace be upon him). He came to him and made his camel kneel down near the gate of the mosque. He then tied its leg and entered the mosque. The narrator then reported in a similar way. He then said: Who among you is the son of Abd al-Muttalib? The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) replied: I am the son of Ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib. He said: O son of ‘Abd al-Muttalib. The narrator then reported the rest of the tradition.
488 | Abu Hurairah said:The Jews came to the Prophet (May peace be upon him) and he was sitting in the mosque among his Companions. They said: O Abu al-Qasim, a man and a woman have committed adultery.
489 | Narrated AbuDharr:      The earth has been made for me purifying and as a mosque (place for prayer).
490 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      AbuSalih al-Ghifari reported: Ali (once) passed by Babylon during his travels. The mu'adhdhin (the person who calls for prayer) came to him to call for the afternoon prayer. When he passed by that place, he commanded to announce for the prayer. After finishing the prayer he said: My affectionate friend (i.e. the Prophet) prohibited me to say prayer in the graveyard. He also forbade me to offer prayer in Babylon because it is accursed.
491 | Abu Salih narrated this tradition with a different chain of transmitters to the same effect as reported by Sulaiman b. Dawud. But this version has the word KHARAJA (he went out) instead of BARAZA (proceeded).
492 | Narrated Sa'id:      and the narrator Musa said: As far as Amr thinks, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: The whole earth is a place of prayer except public baths and graveyards.
493 | Bara’ b. Azib reported :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was asked about saying prayer at places where the camels kneel down. He replied; Do not say prayer at places where the camels kneel down because they are the places of devils. And he was asked about saying prayer in the fold of sheep. He replied: pray there because they are the places of blessing.
494 | Narrated As-Saburah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Command a boy to pray when he reaches the age of seven years. When he becomes ten years old, then beat him for prayer.
495 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Command your children to pray when they become seven years old, and beat them for it (prayer) when they become ten years old; and arrange their beds (to sleep) separately.
496 | This tradition has been narrated by Dawud b. Sawar al-Muzani through a different chain of transmitters and to the same effect. This version adds; if any of you marries his slave-girl to his male-slave or his servant, he should not look at her private part below her navel and above her knees.   Abu Dawud said:Waki' misunderstood the name of Dawud b. Sawar. Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi has narrated this tradition from him. He said: Anu Hamzah Sawar al-Sairafi.
497 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Abdullah ibn Khubayb al-Juhani:      Hisham ibn Sa'd reported: We entered upon Mu'adh ibn Abdullah ibn Khubayb al-Juhani. He said to his wife: When (at what age) should a boy pray? She replied: Some person of us reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked about it; he said: When a boy distinguishes right hand from the left hand, then command him to pray.
498 | Narrated AbuUmayr ibn Anas:      AbuUmayr reported on the authority of his uncle who was from the Ansar (the helpers of the Prophet): The Prophet (ﷺ) was anxious as to how to gather the people for prayer.        The people told him: Hoist a flag at the time of prayer; when they see it, they will inform one another. But he (the Prophet) did not like it. Then someone mentioned to him the horn.        Ziyad said: A horn of the Jews. He (the Prophet) did not like it. He said: This is the matter of the Jews. Then they mentioned to him the bell of the Christians.  He said: This is the matter of the Christians.  Abdullah ibn Zayd returned anxiously from there because of the anxiety of the Apostle (ﷺ). He was then taught the call to prayer in his dream. Next day he came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him about it.        He said: Messenger of Allah, I was between sleep and wakefulness; all of a sudden a newcomer came (to me) and taught me the call to prayer. Umar ibn al-Khattab had also seen it in his dream before, but he kept it hidden for twenty days.        The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me (Umar): What did prevent you from saying it to me?        He said: Abdullah ibn Zayd had already told you about it before me: hence I was ashamed.        Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Bilal, stand up, see what Abdullah ibn Zayd tells you (to do), then do it. Bilal then called them to prayer.        AbuBishr reported on the authority of AbuUmayr: The Ansar thought that if Abdullah ibn Zayd had not been ill on that day, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would have made him mu'adhdhin.
499 | ‘Abd Allah b. Zaid reported :when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered a bell to be made so that it might be struck to gather the people for prayer, a man carrying a bell in his hand appeared to me while I was asleep, and I said; servant of ‘abd Allah, will you sell the bell? He asked; what will you do with it? I replied; we shall use it to call the people to prayer. He said; should I not suggest you something better than that. I replied: certainly. Then he told me to say: Allah is most great, Allah is most great, Allah is most great, Allah is most great. I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Come to pray, come to pray; come to salvation; come to salvation. Allah is most great, Allah is most great. I testify that there is no god but Allah. He then moved backward a few steps and said: when you utter the IQAMAH, you should say: Allah is most great, Allah is most great. I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Come to prayer, come to salvation. The time for prayer has come, the time for prayer has come: Allah is most great, Allah is most great. There is no god but Allah. When the morning came, I came to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and informed him of what I had seen in the dream. He said: it is a genuine vision, and he then should use it to call people to prayer, for he has a louder voice than you have. So I got up along with Bilal and began to teach it to him and he used it in making the call to prayer. ‘Umar b. al-khattab (Allah be pleased with him) heard it while he was in his house and came out trailing his cloak and said: Messenger of Allah. By him who has sent you with the truth, I have also seen the kind of thing as has been shown to him. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: To Allah be the praise. Abu Dawud said; Al-Zuhri narrated this tradition in a similar way from Sa’id b. al-Musayyib on the authority of ‘Abd Allah b. Zaid. In this version Ibn Ishaq narrated from al-Zuhri: Allah is most great. Allah is most great, Allah is most great, Allah is most great. Ma;mar and yunus narrated from al-Zuhri; Allah is most great, Allah is most great. They did not report it twice again.
500 | Abu Mahdhurah reported; I said; Messenger of Allah, teach me the method of ADHAN (how to pronounce the call to prayer). He wiped my forehead (with his hand) and asked me to pronounce; Allah is most great. Allah is most great. Allah is most great. Allah is most great, raising your voice while saying them (these words). Then you must raise your voice in making the testimony:I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Lowering your voice while saying them (these words). Then you must raise your voice in making the testimony: I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify there is no god but Allah; I testify Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Come to prayer, come to prayer; come to salvation, come to salvation. If it is the morning prayer, you must pronounce; prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep, Allah is most great; there is no god but Allah.
501 | Abu Mahdhurah also narrated this tradition from the prophet (May peace be upon him) to the same effect through a different chain of transmitters. This version has the additional wordings. The phrases “prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep” are to be pronounced in the first ADHAN (i.e., not in Iqamah) of the morning prayer.   Abu Dawud said; The version narrated by Musaddad is more clear. It reads:He (the prophet) taught me IQAMAH (to pronounce each phrase) twice: Allah is most great. Allah is most great.  I testify that there is no god but Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah: come to prayer, come to prayer: come to salvation, come to salvation: Allah is most great. Allah is great; there is no god but Allah.   Abu Dawud said: The narrator ‘Abd al-Razzaq said; You pronounce IQAMAH for announcing the prayer; you must say twice: the time for prayer has come, the time for prayer has come. (The Prophet said to Abu Mahdhurah): did you listen (to me)? Abu Mahdhurah would not have the hair of his forehead cut, nor would he separate them (from him) because the Prophet (ﷺ) wiped over them.
502 | Abu Mahdhurah reported ; The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) taught him nineteen phrases in ADHAN and seventeen phrases in IQAMAH. ADHAN runs; Allah is most great. Allah is most great. Allah is most great. Allah is most great; I testify that there is no god but Allah. I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; I testify that there is no god but Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Muhammad is Messenger of Allah:come to prayer, come to prayer, come to salvation; Allah is most great, Allah is most great: there is no god but Allah. IQAMAH runs: Allah is most great, Allah is most great. Allah is most great, Allah is most great: I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; come to prayer; come to prayer: come to salvation. Come to salvation; the time for prayer has come the time for prayer has come: Allah is most great, Allah is most great: there is no god but Allah. This is recorded in his collection (i.e., in the collection of the narrator Hammam b. Yahya) according to the tradition reported by Abu Mahdhurah (i.e., IQAMAH contains seventeen phrases)
503 | Abu Mahdurah reported :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) himself taught me the call to prayer (adhan). He asked me to pronounce: Allah is most great. Allah is most great. Allah is most great. Allah is most great: I testify that there is no god but Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Muhammad is Messenger of Allah. Then repeat and raise your voice; I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify that there is no god but Allah ; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; come to prayer, come to prayer; come to salvation, come to salvation; Allah is most great. Allah is most great; there is no god but Allah.
504 | Abu Mahdhurah reported:The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) taught me the call to prayer (adhan) verbatim; Allah is most great, Allah is most great, Allah is most great, Allah is most great; I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; I testify that there is no god but Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; come to prayer, come to prayer; come to salvation, come to salvation. He used to pronounce “prayer is better than sleep” in the dawn prayer.
505 | Abu Mahdhurah said that the apostle of Allah (May peace be upon him) taught him the call to prayer (adhan), saying:Allah is most great, Allah is most great; I testify that there is no god but Allah. He then narrated adhan like the one contained in the tradition transmitted by Ibn Juraij from ‘Abd al-aziz b. ‘abd al-Malik to the same effect. The version Malik b. Dinar has. I asked the son of Abu Mahdhurah, saying: Narrate to me the adhan of your father narrated from the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him). He said: Allah is most great, Allah is most great, that is all. Similar is the version narrated by Ja’far b. Sulaiman from the son of Abd Muhdhurah from his uncle on the authority of his grandfather, excepting that he said; Then repeat and raise your voice. Allah is most great. Allah is most great.
506 | Ibn Abi Laila said:Prayer passed through three stages. And out people narrated to us that Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said; it is to my liking that the prayer of Muslims or believers should be united (i.e., in congregation), so much so that I intended to send people to the houses to announce the time of prayer; and I also resolved that I should order people to stand at (the tops of) the forts and announce the time of the prayer for Muslims; and they struck the bell or were about to strike the bell (to announce the time for prayer). Then came a person from among the Ansar who said: Messenger of Allah, when I returned from you, as I saw your anxiety. I saw (in sleep) a person with two green clothes on him; he stood on the  mosque and called (people) to prayer. He then sat down for a short while and stood up and pronounced in a like manner, except that he added: “The time for prayer has come”. If the people did not call me (a liar), and according to the version of Ibn al-Muthanna, if you did not call me (a liar). I would say that I was awake; I was awake; I was not asleep. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: According to the version of Ibn al-Muthanna, Allah has shown you a good (dream). But the version of ‘Amr does not have the words: Allah has shown you a good (dream). Then ask Bilal to pronounce the ADHAN (to call to the prayer). ‘Umar (in the meantime) said: I also had a dream like the one he had. But as he informed earlier. I was ashamed (to inform). Our people have narrated to us: when a person came (to the mosque during the prayer in congregation), he would ask (about the RAKAHS of prayer), and he would be informed about the number of RAKAHS already performed. They would stand (in prayer) along with the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him): some in standing position; others bowing; some sitting and some praying along with the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him).   Ibn al-Muthanna reported from ‘Amr from Hussain b. Abi Laila, saying ; Until Mu’adh came. Shu’bah said ; I heard it from Hussain who said : I shall follow the position (in the prayer in which I find him (the prophet)). . . you should do in a similar way.   Abu Dawud said: I then turned to the tradition reported by ‘Amr b. Marzuq he said; then Ma’adh came and they (the people) hinted at him. Shu’bah said; I heard it from hussain who said: Mu’adh then said; I shall follow the position (in the prayer when I join it) in which I find him (the prophet). He then said: Mu’adh has prayer when I join it in which I find him (the prophet). He then said: MU’adh has introduced for you a SUNNAH (a model behaviour), so you should do in a like manner. He said; our people have narrated to us; when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to Madina, he commanded them (the people) to keep fast  for three days. Thereafter the Quranic verses with regard to the fasts during Ramadan were revealed. But they were people who were not accustomed to keep fast ; hence the keeping of the fasts was hard for them; so those who could not keep fast would feed an indigent; then the month”. The concession was granted to the patient and the traveler; all were commanded to keep fast.
507 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      Prayer passed through three stages and fasting also passed through three stages. The narrator Nasr reported the rest of the tradition completely. The narrator, Ibn al-Muthanna, narrated the story of saying prayer facing in the direction of Jerusalem.        He said: The third stage is that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to Medina and prayed, i.e. facing Jerusalem, for thirteen months.        Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse: "We have seen thee turning thy face to Heaven (for guidance, O Muhammad). And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a qiblah which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wherever ye may be, turn your face (when ye pray) toward it" (ii.144). And Allah, the Reverend and the Majestic, turned (them) towards the Ka'bah. He (the narrator) completed his tradition.        The narrator, Nasr, mentioned the name of the person who had the dream, saying: And Abdullah ibn Zayd, a man from the Ansar, came. The same version reads: And he turned his face towards the qiblah and said: Allah is most great, Allah is most great; I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; come to prayer (he pronounced it twice), come to salvation (he pronounced it twice); Allah is Most Great, Allah is most great. He then paused for a while, and then got up and pronounced in a similar way, except that after the phrase "Come to salvation" he added. "The time for prayer has come, the time for prayer has come."        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Teach it to Bilal, then pronounce the adhan (call to prayer) with the same words. As regards fasting, he said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to fast for three days every month, and would fast on the tenth of Muharram. Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse: ".......Fasting was prescribed for those before you, that ye may ward off (evil)......and for those who can afford it there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need (ii.183-84). If someone wished to keep the fast, he would keep the fast; if someone wished to abandon the fast, he would feed an indigent every day; it would do for him. But this was changed. Allah, the Exalted, revealed: "The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an ..........(let him fast the same) number of other days" (ii.185).        Hence the fast was prescribed for the one who was present in the month (of Ramadan) and the traveller was required to atone (for them); feeding (the indigent) was prescribed for the old man and woman who were unable to fast. (The narrator, Nasr, further reported): The companion Sirmah, came after finishing his day's work......and he narrated the rest of the tradition.
508 | Anas reported; Bilal was commanded to pronounce Adhan in double pairs and IQAMAH in single pairs.   Hammam added in his version; “except IQAMAH”.
509 | Anas reported the tradition like that of Wuhaib. Ismail said:I narrated this tradition to Ayyub who said: “Except IQAMAH”.
510 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The words of adhan were pronounced from the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) twice in pairs (i.e. four times) each, and the words of iqamah were pronounced once in pairs (twice each), except that the phrase "The time for prayer has come" would be pronounced twice. When we heard iqamah, we would perform ablution, and go out for prayer. Shu'bah said: I did not hear AbuJa'far narrating any other tradition except this one.
511 | This tradition has been narrated by Abu Ja’far, the mu’adhdhin of ‘Uryan mosque (at Kufah), from Abu al-Muthanna, the mu’adhdhin of masjid al-akbar (at kufah) on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar. The rest of the tradition was transmitted in a like manner.
512 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Zayd:      The Prophet (ﷺ) intended to do many things for calling (the people) to prayer, but he did not do any of them. Then Abdullah ibn Zayd was taught in a dream how to pronounce the call to prayer. He came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and informed him. He said: Teach it to Bilal. He then taught him, and Bilal made a call to prayer. Abdullah said: I saw it in a dream and I wished to pronounce it, but he (the Prophet) said: You should pronounce iqamah.
513 | This tradition has also been transmitted through a different chain of narrators by ‘abd Allah b. Zaid. He said:My grandfather pronounced the Iqamah.
514 | Narrated Ziyad ibn al-Harith as-Suda'i:      When the adhan for the dawn prayer was initially introduced, the Prophet (ﷺ) commanded me to call the adhan and I did so. Then I began to ask: Should I utter iqamah, Messenger of Allah? But he began to look at the direction of the east, (waiting) for the break of dawn, and said: No.       When the dawn broke, he came down and performed ablution and he then turned to me. In the meantime his Companions joined him. Then Bilal wanted to utter the iqamah, but the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: The man of Suda' has called the adhan, and he who calls the adhan utters the iqamah.
515 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The mu'adhdhin will receive forgiveness to the extent to which his voice reaches, and every moist and dry place will testify on his behalf; and he who attends (the congregation of) prayer will have twenty-five prayers recorded for him and will have expiation for sins committed between every two times of prayer.
516 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:when the call to prayer is made; the devil turns his back and breaks wind so as not to hear the call being made; but when the call is finished, he turns round. When the second call to prayer (iqamah) is made, he turns his back, and when the second call is finished, he turns round and suggest notions in the mind of the man (at prayer) to distract his attention, saying: remember such and such, referring to something the man did not have n mind, with the result that he does not know how much he has prayed.
517 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The imam is responsible and the mu'adhdhin is trusted, O Allah, guide the imams and forgive the mu'adhdhins.
518 | This tradition has also been transmitted through a different chain of narrators by Abu Hurairah who reported it in a similar manner from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
519 | Narrated A woman from Banu an-Najjar:      Urwah ibn az-Zubayr reported on the authority of a woman from Banu an-Najjar. She said: My house was the loftiest of all the houses around the mosque (of the Prophet at Medina). Bilal used to make a call to the morning prayer from it. He would come there before the break of dawn and wait for it. When he saw it, he would yawn and say: O Allah, I praise you and seek Your assistance for the Quraysh so that they might establish Thine religion.  He then would make the call to prayer.       She (the narrator) said: By Allah, I do not know whether he ever left saying these words on any night.
520 | Abu Juhaifah reported:I came to the prophet (ﷺ) at Mecca; he was sitting in a tent made of leather. Then Bilal came out and called to prayer. I looked at his mouth following him this side and that side (i.e., right and left). Later at his Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out clad in a red suit, i.e, wearing the sheets of the Yemen, of the Qatri design. The version narrated by Musa has the word; “I saw Bilal going towards al-Abtah”.   He then made a call to prayer. When he reached the words “ come to prayer, come to salvation”. He turned his neck right and left, respectively; he did not turn himself (with his whole body). He then entered (his house) and came out with a lancet. The narrator then reported the rest of the tradition.
521 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The supplication made between the adhan and the iqamah is not rejected.
522 | Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :When you hear the Adhan, you should repeat the same words as the mu’adhdhin pronounces.
523 | ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Amr b. al-As reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying:when you hear the mu'adhdhin repeat what he says, invoke a blessing on me, for everyone who invoke one blessing on me will receive ten blessings from Allah. Then ask Allah to give me the wasilah, which is a rank in paradise fitting for only one of Allah’s servants, and I hope that I may be the one. If anyone asks Allah that I be given the wasilah, he will be assured of my intercession.
524 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      A man said: Messenger of Allah, the mu'adhdhins excel us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Say (the same words) as they say, and when you come to the end, make a petition and that will be granted to you.
525 | Sa’d b. Abi Waqqas reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :If anyone says when he hears the MU’ADHDHIN : “And I testify that there is no god but Allah alone who has no partner and that Muhammad is His servant and Apostle: I am satisfied with Allah as lord, with Muhammad as apostle and with Islam as religion”, he will be forgiven.
526 | ‘A’ishah said that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) heard the MU’ADHDHIN uttering the testimony, he would say:“And I too, and  I too”.
527 | ‘Umar b. al-khattab reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying; When the MU’ADHDHIN says:“Allah is most great, Allah is most great”, and one of you says in response: “Allah is most great”, Allah is most great; then says: “ I testify tht there is no god but Allah”, and he says in response: “I testify that there is no god but Allah”, then say:” I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”, and he makes the response: “ I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”, then says: “Come to prayer”, and he makes the response: “There is no might and no power except in Allah”: then says: “ Allah is most great, Allah is most great”, and he makes the response: “Allah is most great”, then says: “There is no god but Allah”, if he says this from his heart, he enter Paradise.
528 | Narrated AbuUmamah, or one of the Companion of the Prophet:      Bilal began the Iqamah, and when he said: "The time for prayer has come," the Prophet (ﷺ) said: "May Allah establish it and cause it to continue."
529 | Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:if anyone says when he hears the call to prayer : “O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and of the prayer which is established for all time, grant Muhammad the wasilah and excellency, and raise him up in a praiseworthy position which Thou hast promised, he will be assured of my intercession.
530 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught me to say when the adhan for the sunset prayer was called; "O Allah, this is the time when Thy night comes on, Thy day retires, and the voices of Thy summoners are heard, so forgive me."
531 | Narrated Uthman ibn Abul'As:      Messenger of Allah, appoint me the leader of the tribe in prayer. He said: You are their leader, but you should follow on who is the weakest of them: and appoint a mu'adhdhin who does not charge for the calling of adhan.
532 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Bilal made a call to prayer before the break of dawn; the Prophet (ﷺ), therefore, commanded him to return and make a call: Lo! the servant of Allah (i.e. I) had slept (hence this mistake).        The version of Musa has the addition: He returned and made a call: Lo! the servant of Allah had slept.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by al-Darawardi from 'Ubaid Allah on the authority of Ibn 'Umar saying: There was a mu'adhdhin of 'Umar, named Mas'ud. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. This version is more correct than that one.
533 | Nafi' reported :A mu'adhdhin of ‘Umar, named Masruh, called the Adhan for the morning prayer before the break of dawn; ‘Umar commanded him (to repeat). The narrator reported the tradition in a similar way.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by al-Darawardi from ‘Ubaid Allah on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar, saying: there was a  mu'adhdhin of ‘Umar, named Mas’ud. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. This version is more correct than one.
534 | Narrated Bilal:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Bilal: Do not call adhan until the dawn appears clearly to you in this way, stretching his hand in latitude.   Abu Dawud said: Shaddad did not see Bilal.
535 | ‘A’ishah reported:Ibn Umm Maktum was the  mu'adhdhin of the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and he was blind.
536 | Abu al-Sha’tha said :we were sitting with Abu Hurairah in the mosque. A man went out of the mosque after the ADHAN for the afternoon prayer had been called. Abu Hurairah said: As regards this (man), he disobeyed Abu al-Qasim, the prophet (ﷺ).
537 | Jabir b. Samurah said:Bilal would call the Adhan, then he used come to wait. When he would see that the prophet (ﷺ) had come out (of his house), he would pronounce the iqama.
538 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Mujahid reported: I was in the company of Ibn Umar. A person invited the people for the noon or afternoon prayer (after the adhan had been called). He said: Go out with us (from this mosque) because this is an innovation (in religion).
539 | Abu Qatadah reported on the authority of his father :the prophet (ﷺ) said; When the Iqamah for prayer is pronounced, do not stand until you see me.   Abu Dawud said: this has been narrated by Ayyub and Hajjaj al-Sawwaf from Yahya and Hisham al-Duatawa’i in a similar way, saying : Yahya wrote to me (in this way). And this has been narrated by Mu’awiyah b. Sallam and ‘Ali b. al-Mubarak from Yahya: “Until you see me and show tranquility”.
540 | This tradition has also been reported through a different chain of narrators in a similar way. This version says:“Until you see me that I have come out”.   Abu dawud said: No one except Ma’mar has narrated the words “that I have come out”. And the version transmitted by Ibn ‘Uyainah from Ma’mar does not mention the words “that I have come out”.
541 | Abu Hurairah reported:when the Iqamah was pronounced for prayer during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), the people would take their seats before the prophet (ﷺ) came to his seat.
542 | Humaid reported :I asked Thabit al-Bunani whether it was permissible for a man to talk after the qamah had been pronounced. He narrated a tradition on the authority of Anas: (once) the Iqamah was pronounced, and a person came to the apostle of Allah (ﷺ) and detained him after the Iqamah had been pronounced.
543 | ‘Awn b. Kahmas reported on the authority of his father Kahmas :we stood for praying at Mina when the Imam had not come out. Some of us sat down (and I too). An old man from Kufah said to me: Why did you down? I said : Ibn Buraidah, this is Sumud (i.e., waiting for the Imam in the standing condition). The old man then narrated a tradition from ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awaajah on the authority of al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib: We would stand in rows during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for a long time before he pronounced Takbir. He further said; Allah, the Exalted and Mighty, sends blessings and the angles invoke blessings for those who are nearer to the front rows. No step is more liking to Allah than a step which one takes to join the row (of the prayer).
544 | Anas reported :the Iqamah was pronounced (for the night prayer) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained engaged in talking (to a person) in the corner of the mosque. He did not begin prayer until the people slept.
545 | Abu al-Nadr said:when the Iqamah was pronounced and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that they (the people) were small in number, he would sit down, nd would not pray; but when he saw them (the people) large in number, he would pray.
546 | This tradition has been transmitted through a different chain of narrators in a similar way by ‘Ali b. Abi Talib.
547 | Narrated AbudDarda':      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If there are three men in a village or in the desert among whom prayer is not offered (in congregation), the devil has got the mastery over them. So observe (prayer) in congregation), for the wolf eats only the straggling animal. Sa'ib said: By the word Jama'ah he meant saying prayer in company or in congregation.
548 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying; I thought to give orders for arranging prayer in congregation, and then to have the Iqamah called for it, then to order a man to lead the people in prayer, then to go off in company of the people who have bundles of firewood to those people who are not present at the prayer and then to burn down their houses with fire.
549 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:I thought about giving orders to some youths for gathering a bundle of firewood, then going off to some people who their prayers in their homes without any excuse, and burning down their houses over them.   I (Yazid b. Yazid) said: I asked Yazid b. al-Asamm: Abu ‘Awf did he mean Friday (prayer) or any other? He replied: may my ears become deaf if I have not heard Abu Hurairah narrating it from the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him); He did not mention Friday (prayer) or any other.
550 | Abd Allah b. Mas’ud said:Persevere in observing these five times of prayer where the announcement for them is made, because they are from the paths of right guidance. And Allah, the Might, the Majestic, has laid down for his prophet (ﷺ) the paths of right guidance. I have seen the time when no one stayed away from prayer except a hypocrite whose hypocrite was well known. I witnessed the time when a man would be brought swaying between two men till he was set up in the row (of the prayer). Every one of us has a mosque of his in his house. If you were to pray in your houses and stay from your mosques. You would abandon the Sunnah (practice) of your prophet, and if you were Abandon the Sunnah (Practice) of your Prophet, you would become an unbeliever.
551 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      If anyone hears him who makes the call to prayer and is not prevented from joining the congregation by any excuse--he was asked what an excuse consisted of and replied that it was fear or illness--the prayer he offers will not be accepted from him.
552 | Narrated Amr ibn Za'dah, Ibn Umm Maktum:      Ibn Umm Maktum asked the Prophet (ﷺ) saying: Messenger of Allah, I am a blind man, my house is far away (from the mosque), and I have a guide who does not follow me. Is it possible that permission be granted to me for saying prayer in my house? He asked: Do you hear summons (adhan)? He said: Yes. He said: I do not find any permission for you.
553 | Narrated Ibn Umm Maktum:      Messenger of Allah, there are many venomous creatures and wild beasts in Medina (so allow me to pray in my house because I am blind). The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Do you hear the call, "Come to prayer," "Come to salvation"? (He said: Yes.) Then you must come.    Abu Dawud said: Al-Qasim al-Jarmi has narrated this tradition from Sufyan in a similar manner. But his version does not contain the words "Then you must come."
554 | Narrated Ubayy ibn Ka'b:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in the dawn prayer one day. And he said: Is so and so present? They said: No. He (again) asked: Is so and so present? They replied: No. He then said: These two prayers are the ones which are most burdensome to hypocrites. If you knew what they contain (i.e. blessings), you would come to them, even though you had to crawl on your knees. The first row is like that of the angels, and if you knew the nature of its excellence, you would race to join it.        A man's prayer said along with another is purer than his prayer said alone, and his prayer with two men is purer than his prayer with one, but if there are more it is more pleasing to Allah, the Almighty, the Majestic.
555 | ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan reported the Messenger of Allah (may peace be him) as saying; if anyone says the night prayer in congregation, he is like one who keeps vigil (in prayer) till midnight; and he who says both the night and dawn prayer in congregation is like one who keeps vigil (in prayer) the whole night.
556 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The further one is from the mosque , the greater will be one's reward.
557 | Ubayy b. Ka’b said:There was a certain person, out of all people of Medina, who used to pray in the mosque. I do not know that any one of them lived at a farther distance than that man. Still he never missed the prayer in congregation in the mosque. I said: it would be better if you buy a donkey and ride it in heat and darkness. He said: I do not like that my house be by the side of the mosque. The discourse reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said him about it. He said: I did it so that my walking to the mosque and return to my home when I return be recorded. He said: Allah has granted all this to you; Allah has granted all that you reckoned.
558 | Narrated AbuUmamah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If anyone goes out from his house after performing ablution for saying the prescribed prayer in congregation (in the mosque), his reward will be like that of one who goes for hajj pilgrimage after wearing ihram (robe worn by the hajj pilgrims).       And he who goes out to say the mid-morning (duha) prayer, and takes the trouble for this purpose, will take the reward like that of a person who performs umrah. And a prayer followed by a prayer with no worldly talk during the gap between them will be recorded in Illiyyun.
559 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Prayer said by a man in congregation is twenty five degrees more excellent than prayer said by him alone in his house or in the market. This is because when any of you performs ablution and does it perfectly, and goes out to the mosque having no intention except praying, and nothing moves him except prayer, then at every step which he takes his rank is elevated by one degree on account of this (walking), and one sin is remitted from him for this (walking), till he enters the mosque. When he enters the mosque, he will be reckoned as praying as long as he will be detained by the prayer. The angels keep on invoking blessing on any of you so long as he remains seated in the place he prayer, saying: O Allah, forgive him; O Allah, have mercy on him; O Allah, accept his repentance so long as he does not harm anyone, or breaks his ablution.
560 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      Prayer in congregation is equivalent to twenty-five prayers (offered alone). If he prays in a jungle, and performs its bowing and prostrations perfectly, it becomes equivalent to fifty prayers (in respect of reward).   Abu Dawud said: 'Abd al-Walid b. Ziyad narrated in his version of this tradition: "Prayer said by a single person in a jungle is more excellent by multiplied degrees than prayer said in congregation."
561 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Give good tidings to those who walk to the mosques in darkness for having a perfect light on the Day of Judgment.
562 | Narrated Ka'b ibn Ujrah:      AbuThumamah al-Hannat said that Ka'b ibn Ujrah met him while he was going to the mosque; one of the two (companions) met his companion (on his way to the mosque) And he met crossing the fingers of my both hands. He prohibited me to do so, and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has said: If any of you performs ablution, and performs his ablution perfectly, and then goes out intending for the mosque, he should not cross the fingers of his hand because he is already in prayer.
563 | Narrated A person from the Ansar:      Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said: An Ansari was breathing his last. He said: I narrate to you a tradition, and I narrate it with the intention of getting a reward from Allah.        I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If any one of you performs ablution and performs it very well, and goes out for prayer, he does not take his right step but Allah records a good work (or blessing) for him, and he does not take his left step but Allah remits one sin from him. Any one of you may reside near the mosque or far from it; if he comes to the mosque and prays in congregation, he will be forgiven (by Allah).       If he comes to the mosque while the people had prayed in part, and the prayer remained in part, and he prays in congregation the part he joined, and completed the part he had missed, he will enjoy similarly (i.e. he will be forgiven). If he comes to the mosque when the people had finished prayer, he will enjoy the same.
564 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: whoever performs ablution, and  performs his ablution perfectly, and then goes to the mosque and finds that the people had finished the prayer (in congregation), Allah will give him a reward like one who prayed in congregation and attended it; The reward of those who prayed in congregation will not be curtailed.
565 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      Do not prevent the female servants of Allah from visiting the mosques of Allah, but they may go out (to the mosque) having no perfumed themselves.
566 | Ibn ‘Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying; Do not prevent the female servant your women from visiting the mosques of Allah.
567 | Ibn ‘Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying; Do not prevent your women from visiting the mosque; but their houses are better for them (for praying).
568 | ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar reported the prophet (ﷺ) as saying; Allow women to visit the mosque at night. A son of his (Bilal) said; I swear by Allah, we shall certainly not allow them because they will defraud. I swear by Allah, we shall not allow them. He (Ibn ‘Umar) abused him and became angry at him and said :I tell you that the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: Allow them; yet you say; we shall not allow them.
569 | ‘A’ishah (Allah be pleased with her), wife of the prophet (ﷺ), said ; if the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had seen what the women have invented, he would have prevented them from visiting the mosque (for praying), as the women of the children of  the Israel were prevented. Yahya (the narrator) said; I asked ‘Umrah ; were the women of Israel prevented? She said:yes.
570 | ‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) reported the prophet (ﷺ) as saying; it is more excellent for a woman to pray in her house than in her courtyard, and more excellent for her to pray in her private chamber than in her house.
571 | Ibn ‘Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :if we reserve this door for women (it would be better). Nafi' said: Ibn ‘Umar did not enter through it( the door) till he died.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated though a different chain of transmitters by 'Umar. And this is more correct.
572 | Abu Hurairah said:I heard the Messenger of Allah( may peace be upon him) say: When the iqamah is pronounced for prayer, do not come to it running, but come walking(slowly). You should observe tranquility. The part of the prayer you get(along with the imam) offer it, and the part you miss complete it(afterwards).   Abu Dawud said: The version narrated by al-Zubaidi, Ibn Abi Dhi’b, Ibrahim b. Sa’d, Ma’mar, Shu’aib b. Abi Hamzah on the authority of al-Zuhri has the words: “the part you miss then complete it”. Ibn ‘Uyainah alone narrated from al-Zuhri the words “then offer it afterwards”. And Muhammad b. ‘Amr narrated from Abu Salamah on the authority of Abu Hurairah, and Ja’far b. Rabi’ah narrated from al-A’raj on the authority of Abu Hurairah the words “then complete it”. And Ibn Mas’ud narrated from the Prophet(ﷺ) and Abu Qatadah and Anas reported from the Prophet( may peace be upon him) the words” then complete it”.
573 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet(ﷺ) as saying:Come to prayer with calmness and tranquility. Then pray the part you get (long with the imam) and complete afterwards the part you miss.   Abu Dawud said: Ibn Sirin narrated from Abu Hurairah the words: "he should complete it afterwards." Similarly, Abu Rafi' narrated from Abu Hurairah and Abu Dharr narrated from him the words "then complete it, and complete it afterwards." There is a variation of words in the narration from him.
574 | Narrated Sa'id al-Khudri:      The Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) saw a person praying alone. He said: Is there any man who may do good with this (man) and pray along with him.
575 | Narrated Yazid ibn al-Aswad:      Yazid prayed along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he was a young boy. When he (the Prophet) had prayed there were two persons (sitting) in the corner of the mosque; they did not pray (along with the Prophet). He called for them. They were brought trembling (before him). He asked: What prevented you from praying along with us? They replied: We have already prayed in our houses. He said: Do not do so. If any of you prays in his house and finds that the imam has not prayed, he should pray along with him; and that will be a supererogatory prayer for him.
576 | Jabir b. Yazid reported on the authority of his father:I said the morning prayer along with the prophet (ﷺ) at Mina. He narrated the rest of the tradition to the same effect.
577 | Narrated Yazid ibn Amir:      I came while the Prophet (ﷺ) was saying the prayer. I sat down and did not pray along with them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned towards us and saw that Yazid was sitting there. He said: Did you not embrace Islam, Yazid? He replied: Why not, Messenger of Allah; I have embraced Islam. He said: What prevented you from saying prayer along with the people? He replied: I have already prayed in my house, and I thought that you had prayed (in congregation). He said: When you come to pray (in the mosque) and find the people praying, then you should pray along with them, though you have already prayed. This will be a supererogatory prayer for you and that will be counted as obligatory.
578 | A man from Banu Asad b. Khuzaimah asked Abu Ayyub al-Ansari:if one of us prays in his house, then comes to the mosque and finds that the iqamah is being called, and if I pray along with them ( in congregation), I feel something inside about it. Abu Ayyub replied: We asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about it. He said: That is a share from the spoils received by the warriors (i.e. he will receive double the reward of the prayer).
579 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Sulayman, the freed slave of Maymunah, said: I came to Ibn Umar at Bilat (a place in Medina) while the people were praying. I said: Do you not pray along with them? He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Do not say a prayer twice in a day.
580 | Narrated Uqbah ibn Amir:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: He who leads the people in prayer, and he does so at the right time, will receive, as well as those who are led (in prayer) will get (the reward). He who delays (prayer) from the appointed time will be responsible (for this delay) and not those who are led in prayer.
581 | Narrated Sulamah daughter of al-Hurr:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: One of the signs of the Last Hour will be that people in a mosque will refuse to act as imam and will not find an imam to lead them in prayer.
582 | Abu Mas’ud al-Badri reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:The one of you who is most versed in the Books of Allah should act as imam for the people; and the one who is the earliest of them in reciting (the Qur’an); if they are equally versed in reciting it, then the earliest of them to emigrate (to Medina); if they emigrated at the same time, then the oldest of them. No man must lead another in prayer in his house (i.e. in the house of a latter) or where the latter has authority, or sit in his place of honor without his permission. Shu’bah said: I asked Isma’il: what is the meaning of his place of honor? He replied: his throne.
583 | The version of this tradition narrated through a different chain by Shu’bah has the words:“A man should not lead the another man in prayer.   Abu Dawud said: Yahya al-Qattan narrated from Shu’bah in a similar way, i.e. the earliest of them in recitation.
584 | This tradition has been transmitted through a different chain by Abu Mas’ud This version has words ; “If they are equally versed in recitation, then the one who has most knowledge of the Sunnah ; if they are equal with regard to (the knowledge of) the Sunnah, then the earliest of them to emigrate (to medina)”. He did not narrate the words; “ The earliest of them in recitation”.   Abu Dawud said:Hajjaj b. Artata reported from Isma’il: Do not sit in the place of honour of anyone except with his permission.
585 | ‘Amr b. Salamah said ; we lived at a place where the people would pass by us when they came to the prophet (ﷺ). When they returned they would again pass by us. And they used to inform us that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said so –and-so. I was a boy with a good memory. From the( process) I memorized a large portion of the Qur’an. Then my father went to the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) along with a group of his clan. He (the Prophet) taught them prayer. And he said:The one of you who knows most of the Qur’an should act as your imam. I knew the Qur’an better than most of them because I had memorized it. They, therefore, put me in front of them, and I would lead them in prayer. I wore a small yellow mantle which, when I prostrated myself, went up on me, and a woman of the clan said: Cover the back side of your leader from us. So they bought an ‘Ammani shirt for me, and I have never been so pleased about anything after embracing Islam as I was about that (shirt). I used to lead them in prayer and I was only seven or eight year old.
586 | This tradition has also been transmitted through a different chain by ‘Amr b. Salamah. This version says:“I used to lead them in prayer with a sheet of cloth on me that was patched and torn. When I prostrated myself, my buttocks were disclosed.
587 | ‘Amr b. Salamah reported on the authority of his father (Salamah) that they visited the Prophet (ﷺ). When they intended to return, they said:Messenger of Allah, who will lead us in prayer? He said: The one of you who knows most of the Qur’an, or memorizes most of the Qur’an, (should act as your imam). There was none in the clan who knew more of the Qur’an than I did. They, therefore, put me in front of them and I was only a boy. And I wore a mantle, Whenever I was present in the gathering of Jarm (name of his clan), I would act as their Imam, and lead them in their funeral prayer until today.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by ‘Amr b. Salamah through a different chain of transmitter. This version has: “When my clan visited the Prophet( may peace be upon him) ....” He did not report it on the authority of his father.
588 | Ibn ‘Umar said:when the first emigrants came (to Madina), they stayed at al-‘Asbah (a place near Madina) before the advent of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Salim, the client of Abu Hudhaifah, acted as their imam, as he knew the Qur’an better than all of them, al-Haitham(the narrator) added: and ‘Umar b. al-Khattab and Abu Salamah b. ‘Abd al-Asad were among them.
589 | Malik b. al-Huwairith said that the Prophet( may peace be upon him) told him or some of his companions:When the time of prayer comes, call the Adhan, then call the iqamah, then the one who is oldest of you should act as your imam.   The version narrated by Maslamah goes : He said: On that day we were almost equal in knowledge.   The version narrated by Isma’il says: Khalid said: I said to Abu Qilabah: where is the Qur’an(i.e. why did the Prophet(ﷺ)  not say: The one who knows the Qur’an most should act as imam)? He replied: Both of them were equal in the knowledge of the Qur’an.
590 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Let the best among you call the adhan for you, and the Qur'an-readers act as your imams.
591 | Narrated Umm Waraqah daughter of Nawfal:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) proceeded for the Battle of Badr, I said to him: Messenger of Allah allow me to accompany you in the battle. I shall act as a nurse for patients. It is possible that Allah might bestow martyrdom upon me. He said: Stay at your home. Allah, the Almighty , will bestow martyrdom upon you.       The narrator said: Hence she was called martyr. She read the Qur'an. She sought permission from the Prophet (ﷺ) to have a mu'adhdhin in her house. He, therefore, permitted her (to do so).       She announced that her slave and slave-girl would be free after her death. One night they went to her and strangled her with a sheet of cloth until she died, and they ran away.       Next day Umar announced among the people, "Anyone who has knowledge about them, or has seen them, should bring them (to him)."       Umar (after their arrest) ordered (to crucify them) and they were crucified. This was the first crucifixion at Medina.
592 | This tradition has also been narrated through a different chain of transmitters by Umm Waraqah daughter of ‘Abd Allah b. al-Harith. The first version is complete. This version goes:The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) used to visit her at her house. He appointed a mu’adhdhin to call adhan for her; and he commanded her to lead the inmates of her house in prayer. ‘Abd al-Rahman said: I saw her mu’adhdhin who was an old man.
593 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There are three types of people whose prayer is not accepted by Allah: One who goes in front of people when they do not like him; a man who comes dibaran, which means that he comes to it too late; and a man who takes into slavery an emancipated male or female slave.
594 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) as saying:The obligatory prayer is essential behind every Muslim, pious or impious, even if he has committed a sins.
595 | Anas said that the Prophet (ﷺ) appointed Ibn Umm Maktum as substitute to lead the people in prayer, and he was blind.
596 | Abu ‘Atiyyah, a freed slave of us, said:Malik b. al-Huwairith came to this place of prayer of ours, and the iqamah for prayer was called. We said to him: Come forward and lead the prayer. He said to us: Put one of your own men forward to lead you in prayer. I heard the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) say: If anyone visits people, he should not lead them in prayer, but some person of them should lead the prayer.
597 | Hammam said:Hudhaifah led the people in prayer in al-Mada’in standing on the shop(or a bench). Abu Mas’ud took him by his shirt, and brought him down. When he( Abu Mas’ud) finished his prayer, he said: Do you not know that they(the people) were prohibited to do so. He said: Yes, I remembered when you pulled me down.
598 | ‘Adi b. Thabit al-Ansari said; A man related to me that (once) he was in the company of ‘Ammar b. yasir in al-Mada’in (a city near Ku’fah). The IQAMAH was called for prayer:‘Ammar came forward and stood on a shop (or a beach) and prayed while the people stood on a lower place than he. Hudaifah came forward and took him by the hands and Ammar followed him till Hudaifah brought him down. When ‘Ammar finished his prayer. Hudaifah said to him: Did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) say: When a man leads the people in prayer, he must not stand in a position higher than theirs, or words to that effect? ‘Ammar replied : that is why I followed you when you took me by the hand.
599 | Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah said :Mu’adh b. Jabal would pray along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)in the night prayer, then go and lead his people and lead them in the same prayer.
600 | Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah said :Mu’adh b. Jabal would pray along the prophet (ﷺ), then go and lead his people in prayer.
601 | Anas b. Malik said; The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode a horse and was thrown off it and his right was grazed. He then prayed one of the prayers sitting and we prayed one of the prayers sitting, and when he finished he said:the Imam is appointed only to be followed ; so when he prays standing, pray standing, and when he bows, bow; when he raises himself, raise yourselves; when he says “Allah listen to him who praises Him”, “Our Lord ! to Thee be the praise”: and when he prays sitting all of you pray sitting.
602 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode a horse in Medina. It threw him off at the root of a date-palm. His foot was injured. We visited him to inquire about his illness. We found him praying sitting in the apartment of Aisha. We, therefore, stood, (praying) behind him. He kept silent.       We again visited him to inquire about his illness. He offered the obligatory prayer sitting. We, therefore, stood (praying) behind him; he made a sign to us and we sat down. When he finished the prayer, he said: When the imam prays sitting, pray sitting; and when the imam prays standing, pray standing, and do not act as the people of Persia used to act with their chiefs (i.e. the people stood and they were sitting).
603 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The imam is appointed only to be followed; when he says "Allah is most great," say "Allah is most great" and do not say "Allah is most great" until he says "Allah is most great." When he bows; bow; and do not bow until he bows. And when he says "Allah listens to him who praise Him," say "O Allah, our Lord, to Thee be the praise."       The version recorded by Muslim goes: "And to Thee be the praise:  And when he prostrate; and do not prostrate until he prostrates. When he prays standing, pray standing, and when he prays sitting, all of you pray sitting.   Abu Dawud said: The words "O Allah, our Lord, to You be the praise" reported by Sulaiman were explained to me by some of our companions.
604 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The imam is appointed only to be followed. This version adds: When he recites (the Qur'an), keep silent."   Abu Dawud said: The addition of the words "When he recites, keep silent" in this version are not guarded. The misunderstanding, according to us, is on the part of Abu Khalid (a narrator).
605 | ‘A’ishah said; The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed in his house sitting and the people prayed behind him standing. He made a sign to them (asking them) to sit down. When he finished the prayer, he said :The IMAM is  appointed only to be followed; so when he prays standing. Pray standing ; and when he raises himself, raise yourself: and when he prays sitting. Pray sitting.
606 | Jabir said :when the prophet (ﷺ) became seriously ill, we prayed behind him while he was sitting and Abu Bakr was calling “Allah is most great “ to cause the people to hear the TAKBIR. Then he (the narrators) narrated the rest of the tradition.
607 | Husain reported on the authority of the children of Sa’d b. Mu’adh that Usaid b. Hudair used to act as their Imam. (when he fell ill) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to him inquiring about his illness. They said:Messenger of Allah, our Imam is ill. He said : When he prays sitting, pray sitting.   Abu Dawud said : The chain of this tradition is not continuous (muttasil)
608 | Anas said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered upon Umm Haram. The people (in her house) brought some cooking oil dates to him. He said; Put it (dates) back in its container and return it (cooking oil) to its bag, because I am keeping fast. He then stood and led us in prayer two Rak’ahs of supererogatory prayer.

700 | Abu Salih said:I narrate what I witnesses from Abu Sa'id and heard from him. Abu Sa'id entered upon Marwan and said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: When one of you prays facing any object which conceals him from people, and someone wishes to pass in front of him, he should strike him at his chest; if he refuses (to go), he should fight him; he is only a devil.

I asked him: Why has the black dog been specified, distinguishing it from a red, a yellow and a white dog?

704 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Ikrimah reported on the authority of Ibn Abbas, saying: I think the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: When one of you prays without a sutrah, a dog, an ass, a pig, a Jew, a Magian, and a woman cut off his prayer, but it will suffice if they pass in front of him at a distance of over a stone's throw.   Abu Dawud said: There is something about this tradition in my heart. I used to discuss it with Ibrahim and others. I did not find anyone who narrated it from Hisham and knew it. I did not know anyone who reported it from Hisham and knew it. I did not know anyone who related it from Hisham. I think the confusion is on the part of Ibn Abi Saminah that is, Muhammad b. Isma'il al-Basri, the freed slave of Banu Hisham. In this tradition the mention of words "a Magian" is rejected; the mention of the words "at a stone's throw" and "a pig" is rejected.   Abu Dawud said: I did not hear this tradition except from Muhammad b. Isma'il b. Samurrah and I think he was mistaken because he used to narrate to us from his memory.
705 | Yazid b. Namran said:I saw a crippled man at Tabuk. He (the man) said: I passed riding a donkey in front of the Prophet(ﷺ) who was praying. He said (cursing him): O Allah, cut off his walking. Thenceforth I could not walk.
706 | This tradition as also been reported by Sa’id through the same chain of narrators and to the same effect. He added:He cut off our prayer, may Allah cut off his walking.   Abu Dawud said: This version narrated by Mushir on the authority of Sa’id has: He cut off our prayer.
707 | Sa’id b. Ghazwan reported on the authority  of his father that he made his stay at Tabuk(during his journey) for performing Hajj. All of a sudden he saw a crippled man and asked him about his condition. He said:I relate to you a tradition, but do not narrate it to anyone so long as I am alive: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) encamped at Tabuk near a date-palm and he said:  This is our qiblah (direction for praying). He then offered prayer facing it. I came running, when I was a boy, until I passed the place between him and the tree. He said (cursing): He cut off our prayer, may Allah cut off his walking. I could not, therefore, stand upon them(feet) till today.
708 | ‘Amr b. Shu’aib reported from his father on the authority of his grand-father:We came down from the mountain pass of Adhaakhir in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The time of prayer came and he prayed facing a direction of prayer, and we were (standing) behind him. Then a kid came and passed in front of him. He kept on stopping it until he brought his stomach near the wall (to detain it), and at last it passed behind him, or as Musaddad said.
709 | Ibn ‘Abbas said:The Prophet (ﷺ) was (once) praying. A kid went passing in front of him and he kept on stopping it.
710 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      I was sleeping in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) with my legs between him and the qiblah. Shu'bah said: I think she said: I was menstruating.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by al-Zuhri, 'Ata, Abu Bakr b. Hafs, Hisham b. 'Urwah, 'Irak b. Malik, Abu al-Aswad and Tamim b. Salamah; all transmitted from 'Urwah on the authority of 'Aishah. Ibrahim narrated from al-Aswad on the authority of 'Aishah. Abu al-Duha narrated from Masruq on the authority of 'Aishah. Al-Qasim b. Muhammad and Abu Salamah narrated it from 'Aisha. All these narrators did not mention the words "And I was menstruating."
711 | ‘Urwah reported on the authority of ‘A’ishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray at night and she (‘A’ishah) would lie between him and the qiblah, sleeping on the bed on which he would sleep. When he wanted to offer the witr prayer, he awakened her and she offered the witr prayer.
712 | ‘A’ishah said:I used to sleep with my legs in front of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he would offer his prayer at night (i.e. tahajjud prayer offered towards the end of the night.). When he prostrated himself he struck my legs, and I drew them up and he then prostrated.
713 | It was reported from Abu An-Nadr, from Abu Salama bin 'Abdur Rahman, from 'Aishah, that she said:"I used to be asleep while my legs would be in the front of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while he was praying during the night. When he wanted to prostrate, he would prod my feet, so I would pull them up, and he would prostrate.
714 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      I used to sleep lying between the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the qiblah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray when I (was lying) in front of him. When he wanted to offer the witr prayer - added by the narrator Uthman - he pinched me - then the narrators are agreed - and said: Set aside.
715 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      I came riding a donkey. Another version has: Ibn Abbas said: When I was near the age of the puberty I came riding a she-ass and found the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) leading the people in prayer at Mina. I passed in front of a part of the row (of worshippers), and dismounting left my she-ass for grazing in the pasture, and I joined the row, and no one objected to that.   Abu Dawud said: These are the words of al-Qa'nabi, and are complete. Malik said: I take it as permissible at the time when the iqamah for prayer is pronounced.
716 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      AbusSahba' said: We discussed the things that cut off the prayer according to Ibn Abbas. He said: I and a boy from Banu AbdulMuttalib came riding a donkey, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was leading the people in prayer. He dismounted and I also dismounted. I left the donkey in front of the row (of the worshippers). He (the Prophet) did not pay attention to that. Then two girls from Banu AbdulMuttalib came and joined the row in the middle, but he paid no attention to that.
717 | The above mentioned narration has also been narrated by Mansur through a different chain of narrators. This version has:Then two girls from Banu ‘Abd al-Muttalib came fighting together. He caught them. ‘Uthman (a narrator) said: He separated them. And Dawud (another narrator) said: He pulled away from the other, but he paid no attention to that.
718 | Narrated Al-Fadl ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us accompanied by Abbas when we were in open country belonging to us. He prayed in a desert with no sutrah in front of him, and a she-ass and a bitch of ours were playing in front of him, but he paid no attention to that.
719 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Nothing interrupt prayer, but repulse as much as you can anyone who passes in front of you, for he is just a devil.
720 | Abu al-Waddak said:A youth from the Quraish passed in front of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri who was praying. He repulsed him. He returned again. He then repulsed him for the third time. When he finished the prayer, he said: Nothing cuts off prayer; but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Repulse as much as you can, for he is just a devil.   Abu Dawud said: If two traditions of the prophet(ﷺ) conflict, the practice of the Companions after him should be taken into consideration.
721 | Salim reported on the authority of his father (Ibn ‘Umar):I saw the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) that when he began prayer, he used to raise his hands opposite his shoulders, and he did so when he bowed, and raised his head after bowing. Sufyan(a narrator) once said: “When he raised his head:; and after he used to say: “When he raised his head after bowing. He would not raise (his hands) between the two prostrations."
722 | ‘Abd Allah b. Umar said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to raise his hands opposite his shoulders when he began prayer, then he uttered takbir (Allah is most great) in the same condition, and then he bowed. And when he raised his back (head) after bowing he raised them opposite his shoulders, and said: “Allah listens to him who praises Him.” But he did not raise his hand when he prostrated himself; he rather raised them when he uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) before bowing until his prayer is finished.
723 | ‘Abd al-Jabbar b. Wa’il (b.Hujr) said:I was a small boy and I did not understand the prayer of my father. So Wa’Il b. ‘Alqamah reported Wa’il b. Hujr as saying: I offered prayer along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He used to raise his hands when he pronounced the takbir (Allah is most great), then pulled his garment around him, then placed his right hand on his left, and entered his hands in his garment. When he was about to bow he took his hands out of his garment, and then raised them. And when he raised his head after bowing, he raised his hands. He then prostrated himself and placed his face (forehead on the ground) between his hands. And when he raised his head after prostration, he also raised his hands until he finished his prayer. Muhammad (a narrator) said: I mentioned it to al-Hasan b. Abu al-Hasan who said: This is how the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) offered prayer; some did it and others abandoned it.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Hammam from ibn Juhadah, but he did not mention the raising of hands after he raised his head at the end of the prostration.
724 | Wa’il b.Hujr said:He saw that when the Prophet(ﷺ) stood up to pray he raised his hands till they were in front of his shoulders and placed his thumbs opposite his ears; then he uttered the Takbir (Allah is most great).
725 | Wa’il b.Hujr said that he saw the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) raise his hands when he uttered the takbir (Allah is most great).
726 | Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:      I purposely looked at the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), how he offered it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up, faced the direction of the qiblah and uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) and then raised his hands in front of his ears, then placed his right hand on his left (catching each other).       When he was about to bow, he raised them in the same manner. He then placed his hands on his knees. When he raised his head after bowing, he raised them in the like manner. When he prostrated himself he placed his forehead between his hands.       He then sat down and spread his left foot and placed his left hand on his left thigh, and kept his right elbow aloof from his  right thigh. He closed his two fingers and made a circle (with the fingers).        I (Asim ibn Kulayb) saw him (Bishr ibn al-Mufaddal) say in this manner. Bishr made the circle with the thumb and the middle finger and pointed with the forefinger.
727 | The above tradition has been transmitted by ‘Asim b. Kulaib through a different chain of narrators and to the same effect. This version has:“He then placed his right hand on the back of his left palm and his wrist and forearm.” This also adds: “I then came back afterwards in a season when it was severe cold. I saw the people putting on heavy clothes moving their hands under the clothes (i.e. raised their hands before and after bowing).”
728 | Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:      I witnessed the Prophet (ﷺ) raise his hands in front of his ears when he began to pray. I then came back and saw them (the people) raising their hands up to their chest when they began to pray. They wore long caps and blankets.
729 | Wa’il b. Hujr said:I came to the Prophet(ﷺ) during winter; I saw his companions raise their hands in their clothes in prayer.
730 | Abu Humaid al-Sa’idi once told a company of ten of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ; Abu Qatadah was one of them:I am one among you who is more informed of the way the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed. They said: Why, By Allah, you did not follow him more than us, nor did you remain in his company longer than us? He said: Yes. They said: Then describe (how the Prophet prayed). He said: When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up to pray, he raised his hands so as to bring them opposite his shoulders, and uttered the takbir (Allah is the most great), until every bone rested in its place properly: then re recited (some verses from the Quran); then he uttered the takbir (Allah is most great), raising his hands so as to bring them opposite his shoulders; then he bowed; placing the palms of his hands on his knees and keeping himself straight, neither raising nor lowering his head; then raised his head saying: “Allah listens to him who praise Him”; then raised his hands so as to bring them exactly opposite to his shoulders; then uttered: “Allah is most great”; then lowered himself to the ground (in prostration), keeping his arms away from his sides; then raised his head, bent his left foot and sat on it, and opened the toes when he prostrated: then he uttered: “Allah is most great”; then raised his head, bent his left foot and sat on it so that every bone returned to its place properly; then he did the same in the second (rak’ah). At the end of the two Rak’ahs he stood up and uttered the takbir (Allah is most great), raising his hands so as to bring them opposite to his shoulders; then he bowed, placing the palms of his hands on his knees and keeping himself straight, neither raising or lowering his head: then raised his head saying: “Allah listens to him who praises Him”; then raised his hands so as to bring them exactly opposite his shoulders; then uttered: “Allah is most great”; then lowered himself to the ground (in prostration), keeping his arms away from his sides; then raised his head, bent his left foot and sat on it, and opened the toes when he prostrated himself; then he prostrated; then uttered: “Allah is most great”; then raised his head, bent his left foot and sat on it so that every bone returned to its place properly; then he did the same in the second (rak’ah). At the end of two rak’ahs he stood up and uttered the takbir (Allah is most great), raising his hands so as to bring them opposite to his shoulders in the way he had uttered the Takbir (Allah is most great) at the beginning of the prayer; then he did that in the remainder of his prayer; and after prostration which if followed by the taslim (salutation) he out his left foot and sat on his left hip. They said: You have spoken the truth. This is how he(peace be upon him) used to pray.
731 | ‘Amr al-Amiri said:I (once) attended the meeting of the companions of the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ). They began to discuss his prayer. Abu Humaid then narrated a part of the same tradition and said: When he bowed he clutched his knees with his palms, and he opened his fingers; then he bent his back without raising his upwards, and did not turn his face (on any side). When he sat at the end of two rak’ahs he sat on the sole of his left foot and raised the right, and after the fourth he placed his left hip on the ground and spread out both his feet one side.
732 | The above mentioned tradition has also been reported by Muhammad b. ‘Amr b. ‘Ata’ through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:“When he prostrated himself he neither placed his arms on the ground nor closed them; putting forward his fingers towards the qiblah.”
733 | Abbas or ‘Ayyash b. Sahl as-Sa’idi said that he was present in a meeting which was attended by his father who was one of the companions of the Prophet(ﷺ), Abu Hurairah, Abu Humaid al-Sa’idi and Abu Usaid. He narrated the same tradition with a slight addition or deletion. He said:He then raised his head after bowing and uttered:”Allah listens to him who praises Him, to Thee, our Lord, be the praise,” and raised his hands. He then uttered: “Allah is most great”; then he prostrated himself and rested on his palms, knees, and the end of his toes while prostrating: then he uttered the Takbir (Allah is most great), and sat down on his hips and raised his other foot; then he uttered the takbir and prostrated himself; then he uttered takbir and stood up, but did not sit on his hips. He (the narrator) then narrated the rest of the tradition. He further said: Then he sat down at the end of two rak’ahs; when he was about to stand after two rak’ahs, he uttered the takbir; then he offered the last two rak’ahs of the prayer. The narrator did not mention about his sitting on the hips spreading out his feet.
734 | ‘Abbas b. Sahl. Said:Abu Humaid, Abu Usaid, Sahl. B Sa’d and Muhammad b. Maslamah (once) got together and discussed how the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) used to offer his prayer. Abu Humaid said: I am more informed than any of you regarding the prayer offered by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then he mentioned a part of it, and said: He then bowed and placed his hands upon his knees as if he caught hold of them; and bent them, keeping (his arms) away from his sides. He them prostrated himself and placed his nose and forehead (on the ground); and kept his arms away from his side, and placed his palms (on the ground opposite his shoulders; he then raised his head that every bone returned to its proper place; (he then prostrated twice) until he finished this prostrations). Then he sat down and spread out his left foot, putting forward the front of his right foot towards the qiblah placing the palm of his right hand on his right knee, and the palm of his left hand on his left knee, and he pointed with his finger.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Ibn al-Mubarak from Fulaih who heard ‘Abbas . Sahl narrating it; but I do not remember it. I think he made the mention of ‘Isa b. ‘Abd Allah who heard ‘Abbas b. Sahl saying: I accompanied Abu Humaid al-Sa’idi.
735 | Abu Humaid reported to the same effect. He said:When he (the Prophet) prostrated he kept his thighs wide and did not let his belly touch the thighs.   Abu Dawud says that Ibn Mubarak narrated this hadith from ‘Abbas b. Sahl, which he did not remember well. It is thought that he has mentioned ‘Isa b. ‘Abd Allah, ‘Abbas b. Sahl and Abu Humaid al-Sa’idi.
736 | Wa’il b. Hujr reported in this tradition from the Prophet(ﷺ):When he prostrated, his knees touched the ground before his palms touched it; when he prostrated himself, he placed his forehead on the ground between his palms, and kept his armpits away from his sides.   Hajjaj reported from Hammam and Shaqiq narrated a similar tradition to us from ‘Asim b. Kulaib on the authority of his father from the Prophet(ﷺ).   And another version narrated by one of them has-and I think in all probability that this version has been narrated by Muhammad b. Juhadah-when he got up (after prostration), he got up with his knees and gave his weight on his thighs.
737 | Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:      I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raising his thumbs in prayer up to the lobes of his ears.
738 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) for prayer (in the beginning), he raised his hands opposite to his shoulders; and when he bowed, he did like that; and when he raised his head to prostrate, he did like that; and when he got up at the end of two rak'ahs, he did like that.
739 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Maymun al-Makki said: that he saw Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr leading in prayer. He pointed with his hands (i.e. raised his hands opposite to the shoulders) when he stood up, when he bowed and when he prostrated, and when he got up after prostration, he pointed with his hands (i.e. raised his hands).       The I went to Ibn Abbas and said (to him) I saw Ibn az-Zubayr praying that I never saw anyone praying. I then told him about the pointing with his hands (raising his hands). He said: If you like to see the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) follower the prayer as offered by Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr.
740 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Nadr ibn Kathir as-Sa'di said: Abdullah ibn Tawus prayed at my side in the mosque of al-Khayf. When he made the first prostration, he raised his head after it and raised his hands opposite to his face. This came as something strange for me. I, therefore, said it to Wuhayb ibn Khalid.       Then Wuhayb ibn Khalid said to him: You are doing a thing that I did not see anyone do. Ibn Tawus then replied: I saw my father doing it, and my father said: I saw Ibn Abbas doing it. I do not know but he said: The Prophet (ﷺ) used to do it.
741 | Nafi’ said on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar that when he began prayer, he uttered the takbir( Allah is most great) and raised his hands; and when he bowed( he raised his hands); and when he said:“Allah listens to him who praises Him,” (he raised his hands); and when he stood up at the end of two rak’ahs, he raised his hands. He (Ibn ‘Umar) traced that back to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).   Abu Dawud said: What is correct is that the tradition reported by Ibn ‘Umar does not go back to the Prophet (may peace beupon him). Abu Dawud said: The narrator Baqiyyah reported the first part of this tradition from ‘Ubaid Allah and traced it back to the Prophet (ﷺ); and the narrator al-Thaqafi reported it from ‘Ubaid Allah as a statement of Ibn ‘Umar himself(not from the Porphet). In this version he said: When he stood at the end of two rak’ahs he raised them up to his breasts. And this is the correct version.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted as a statement of Ibn ‘Umar (and not of the Prophet) by al-Laith b. Sa’d, Malik, Ayyub, and Ibn Juraij; and this has been narrated as a statement of the Prophet (ﷺ) by Hammad b. Salamah alone on the authority of Ayyub. Ayyub and Malik did not mention his raising of hands when he stood after two prostrations, but al-Laith mentioned it in his version. Ibn Juraij said in this version: I asked Nafi’: Did Ibn ‘Umar raise (his hands) higher for the first time? He said: No, I said: Point out to me. He then pointed to the breasts or lower than that.
742 | Nafi’ said:When ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar began his prayer, he raised his hands opposite to his shoulders; and when he raised his head after bowing, he raised them lower than that.   Abu Dawud said: So as far as I know, no one narrated the words “he raised them lower that that” except Malik.
743 | Ibn ‘Umar said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood at the end of two rak’ahs, he uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) and raised his hands.
744 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood for offering the obligatory prayer, he uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) and raised his hands opposite to his shoulders; and he did like that when he finished recitation (of the Qur'an) and was about to bow; and he did like that when he rose after bowing; and he did not raise his hands in his prayer while he was in his sitting position.       When he stood up from his prostrations (at the end of two rak'ahs), he raised his hands likewise and uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) and raised his hands so as to bring them up to his shoulders, as he uttered the takbir in the beginning of the prayer.
745 | Malik b. al-Huwairith said:I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) raise his hands when he uttered the takbir (Allah is most great), when he bowed and when he raised his head after bowing until he brought them to the lobes of his ears.
746 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      If I were in front of the Prophet (ﷺ), I would see his armpits. Ibn Mu'adh added that Lahiq said: Do you not see, AbuHurayrah could not stand in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) while he was praying. Musa added: When he uttered the takbir, he raised his hands.
747 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught us how to pray. He then uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) and raised his hands; when he bowed, he joined his hands and placed them between his knees. When this (report) reached Sa'd, he said: My brother said truly. We used to do this; then we were later on commanded to do this, that is, to place the hands on the knees.
748 | It was reported from Alqamah who said:Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said: Should I not pray for you the way the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed? So he prayed, raising his hands only once.  Abu Dawud said: This is a summarized version of a longer narration and it is not authentic with this wording.
749 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Sufyan through a different chain of narrators. This version has:He raised his hands once in the beginning. Some narrated: (raised his hands) once only.
750 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began prayer, he raised his hands up to his ears, then he did not repeat.
751 | This tradition has been narrated by Sufyan through a different chain of transmitters. This version does not have the words “then he did not repeat”. Sufyan said:The words “then he did not repeat“ were narrated to us later on at Kufah by him (Yazid).   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by Hushaim, Khalid, and Ibn Idris from Yazid. They did not mention the words “then he did not repeat”
752 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      I saw that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his hands when he began prayer, but he did not raise them until he finished (prayer).    Abu Dawud said: This tradition is not sound.
753 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began his prayer, he raised his hands extensively.
754 | Zur’ah b. ‘Abd al-Rahman said:I heard Ibn al-Zubair say: Setting the feet right and placing one hand on the other is a sunnah.
755 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      AbuUthman an-Nahdi said: When Ibn Mas'ud prayed he placed his left hand on the right. The Prophet (ﷺ) saw him and placed his right hand on his left one.
756 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      AbuJuhayfah said: Ali said that it is a sunnah to place one hand on the other in prayer below the navel.
757 | Jarir ad-Dabbi reported:I saw Ali (Allah be pleased with him) catching hold of his left hand) by his right hand on the wrist above the navel.     Abu Dawud said: Sa'id b. Jubair narrated the words: "above the navel". Abu Mijlaz reported the words: "below the navel". This has also been narrated by Abu Hurairah. But that is not strong.
758 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      (The established way of folding hands is) to hold the hands by the hands in prayer below the navel.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: The narrator 'Abd al-Rahman b. Ishaq al-Kufi is weak (i.e. not reliable).
759 | Narrated Tawus:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to place his right hand on his left hand, then he folded them strictly on his chest in prayer.
760 | ‘Ali b. Ali Talib said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up for prayer, he uttered the takbir (Allah is most great), then said: I have turned my face, breaking with all others, towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not a polytheist. My prayer and my devotion, my life and my death belong to Allah, the Lord of the Universe, Who has no partner. That is what I have been commanded, and I am first of Muslims (those who surrender themselves). O Allah, Thou art the King. There is no God but Thee. Thou art my Lord and I am Thy servant. I have wronged myself, but I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me all my sins; Thou Who alone canst forgive sins; and guide me to the best qualities. Thou Who alone canst guide to the best of them; and turn me from evil ones. Thou who alone canst turn from evil qualities. I come to serve and please Thee. All good is in Thy Hands, and evil does not pertain to Thee. I seek refuge in Thee and turn to Thee, Who art blessed and exalted. I ask Thy forgiveness and turn to thee in repentance. When he bowed, he said: O Allah, to Thee I bow, in Thee I trust, and to Thee I submit myself. My hearing, my sight, my brain, my bone and my sinews humble themselves before Thee. When he raised his head, he said: Allah listens to him who praises Him. O our lord, and all praises be to Thee in the whole of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, and in whatever Thou creates afterwards. When he prostrated himself, he said: O Allah, to Thee I prostrate myself, to Thee I trust, and to Thee I submit myself. My face prostrated itself before Him Who created it, fashioned it, and fashioned it in the best shape, and brought forth its hearing and seeing. Blessed is Allah, the best of creators. When he saluted at the end of the prayer, he said: O Allah, forgive me my former and my latter sins, my open and secret sins, my sins in exceeding the limits, and what Thou knowest better than I. Thou art He Who puts forward and puts back. There is deity but Thee.
761 | ‘Ali b. Ali Talib said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up for (offering) obligatory prayer, he uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) and raised his hands opposite to his shoulders, and he did so when he finished the recitation (of the Qur’an) and when he was about to bow; and he did like that when he raised (his head) after bowing. He did not raise his hands in prayer when he was sitting. When he stood at the end of two rak’ahs, he raised his hands in a similar way and uttered the takbir and supplicated in a more or less the same manner as narrated by ‘Abd al-‘Aziz in his version. This version does not mention the words “All good is in Thy Hands and evil does not pertain to Thee.” And this adds: He said when he finished the prayer: “O Allah, forgive me my former and latter sins, my open and secret sins; Thou art my deity; there is no God but Thee.
762 | Shu’aib b. Abi Hamzah said:Ibn al-Munkadir, Ibn Abi Farwah and a number of jurists of Madina said to me: When you recite the supplication “I am first of the Muslims,” say instead; “I am one of the Muslims”.
763 | Anas b. Malik said:A man came panting to join the row of worshippers, and said: Allah is most great; praise be to Allah, much praise, good and blessed. When the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) finished his prayer, he asked: Which of you is the one who spoke the words? He said nothing wrong. Then the man said: I (said), Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); I came and had difficulty in breathing, so I said them. He said: I saw twelve angels racing against one another to be the one to take them to Allah.   The narrator Humaid added: When any of you comes for praying, he should walk as usual (i.e. he should not hasten and run quickly); then he should pray as much as he finds it (along with the imam), and should offer the part of the prayer himself (when the prayer is finished) which the Imam had offered before him.
764 | Narrated Jubayr ibn Mut'im:      Jabir saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observing prayer. (The narrator Amr said: I do not know which prayer he was offering.)       He (the Prophet) said: Allah is altogether great; Allah is altogether great; Allah is altogether great; and praise be to Allah in abundance; and praise be to Allah is abundance; and praise be to Allah in abundance. Glory be to Allah in the morning and after (saying it three times). I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil, from his puffing up (nafkh), his spitting (nafth) and his evil suggestion (hamz).       He (Amr) said: His nafth it poetry, his nafkh is pride, and his hamz is madness.
765 | The above mentioned tradition has also been reported by Jubair b. Mut’im through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:I head the Prophet(ﷺ) uttering (all these supplications) in a supererogatory prayer; he narrated the tradition in a similar manner.
766 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Asim ibn Humayd said: I asked Aisha: By what words the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would begin his supererogatory prayer at night?       She replied: You ask me about a thing of which no one asked me before you. When he stood up, be uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) ten times, and uttered "Praise be to Allah" ten times, and uttered "Glory be to Allah " ten times, and uttered "There is no god but Allah" ten times, and sought forgiveness ten times, and said: O Allah, forgive me, and guide me, and give me sustenance, and keep me well, and he sought refuge in Allah from the hardship of standing before Allah on the Day of Judgment.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been narrated by Khalid b. Ma'dan from Rab'iah al-Jarashi on the authority of 'Aishah.
767 | Abu Salamah b. ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awf said:I asked ‘A’ishah: By what words the Prophet(ﷺ) used to begin his prayer when he stood up at night (to offer tahajjud prayer). She said: When he stood up at night, he began his prayer by saying: O Allah, Lord of Jibra’il, Lord of Mik’ail, and Lord of Israfil, Creator of the Heavens and the Earth, the Knower of what is seen and of what is unseen; Thou decides between Thy servants in which they used to differ. Guide me to the truth where there is a difference of opinion by Thy permission. Thou guidest anyone Thou wishes to the right path.
768 | The above mentioned tradition has been reported by ‘Ikramah with a different chain of narrators. This version adds:When he stood up, he said the takbir (Allah is most great) and said. . . .
769 | Malik said:There is no harm in uttering supplication in prayer, in its beginning, in its middle, and in the end, in obligatory prayer or other.
770 | Rifa’ah b. Rafi’ said:One day we were praying behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his head after bowing, he said: Allah listened to him who praised Him. A man behind the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said: O Allah, Our Lord, and to Thee be praise, much praise, good and blessed. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he asked: Which of you if the one who spoke (the words) just now. The man said: I (uttered) these words, Prophet of Allah. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said: I saw more than thirty angels racing against one another to be the one to write them first.
771 | Ibn ‘Abbas said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up for praying at midnight, he said: o Allah, be praise to Thee, Thou art the light of the heavens and the earth; and to Thee be praise; Thou are the maintainer of the heavens and the earth; and to Thee be praise, Thou art the heavens and the earth and what is between them; Thou art the truth, and Thy statement is truth; and Thy promise is the truth; and the visitation with Thee is true; and the Paradise is true and the Hell-fire is true and the Hour is true; O Allah, to Thee I turned my attention, and by Thee I disputed, and to Thee I brought forth my case, so forgive me my former and latter sins, and my secret and open sins, Thou art my deity, there is no deity but Thou.
772 | Ibn ‘Abbas said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say in his tahajjud prayer(i.e. supererogatory prayer offered in or after the midnight) after he said the takbir; he then narrated the tradition to the same effect.
773 | Narrated Rifa'ah ibn Rafi':      I offered prayer behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Rifa'ah sneezed. The narrator Qutaybah did not mention the name Rifa'ah (but he said: I sneezed). So I said: Praise be to Allah, praise much, good and blessed therein, blessed thereupon, as our Lord likes and is pleased. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he turned and said: Who was the speaker in prayer? He then narrated the rest of the tradition like that of Malik and completed it.
774 | Rabi’ah said:A young man from the Ansar sneezed behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while he was praying. He then said: Praise be to Allah, much, good, blessed, till our Lord is pleased (with us) in the affairs relating to this world and to the other world. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he said: Who was the speaker of these words (in prayer)? The young man kept silence. He again asked: Who was the speaker of these words? He did not say wrong. He said: Messenger of Allah, I said these (words). I did not intend by them but good. He said: These words did not stay below the Throne of the Compassionate (Allah).
775 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up to pray at night (for tahajjud prayer) he uttered the takbir and then said: "Glory be to Thee, O Allah," and "Praise be to Thee" and "Blessed is Thy name," and Exalted is Thy greatness." and "There is no god but Thee." He then said: "There is no god but Allah" three times; he then said: "Allah is altogether great" three times: "I seek refuge in Allah, All-Hearing and All-Knowing from the accursed devil, from his evil suggestion (hamz), from his puffing up (nafkh), and from his spitting (nafth)" He then recited (the Qur'an).    Abu Dawud said: It is said that this tradition has been narrated by 'Ali b. 'Ali from al-Hasan omitting the name of the Companion of the Prophet (ﷺ). The misunderstanding occurred on the part of Ja'far.
776 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began his prayer, he said: "Glory be to Thee, O Allah," and "Praise be to Thee" and "Blessed is Thy name, and Exalted is Thy greatness, sand there is no god but Allah."    Abu Dawud said: This tradition is not well known from 'Abd al-Salam b. Harb. No one narrated this except Talq b. Ghannam. A group of narrators reported the description of prayer from (the narrator) Budail; they did not mention therein this supplication.
777 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      I remember two period of silence in prayer, one when the imam said the takbir; and one when he finished reciting the Fatihah and the surah when he was about to bow. But Imran ibn Husayn took it as something strange. So they wrote about it to Ubayy (ibn Ka'b) in Medina. He verified the statement of Samurah.    Abu Dawud said: Humaid also narrated in this tradition the words "and one period silence when he finished the recitation (of the Qur'an)"
778 | Samurah b. Jundub said:The Prophet(ﷺ) had two periods of silence; when he began his prayer and when he finished the recitation (of the Qur’an). He then narrated the tradition like the version of Yunus.
779 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub; Ubayy ibn Ka'b:      Samurah ibn Jundub and Imran ibn Husayn had a discussion (about the periods of silence in prayer). Samurah then said that he remembered two periods of silence from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); one when he uttered the takbir and the other when he finished reciting: "Not of those with whom Thou art angry, nor of those who go astray" (i.7).       Samurah remembered that, but Imran ibn Husayn rejected it.       Then they wrote about it to Ubayy ibn Ka'b. He wrote a letter to them and gave a reply to them that Samurah remembered correctly.
780 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      I remember from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) two periods of silence. Sa'id said: We asked Qatadah: What are those two periods of silence? He said: (one) when he began his prayer, and (one) when he finished the recitation. Then he added: When he finished reciting (the closing verse of the Fatihah): "Not of those with whom Thou art angry, nor of who go astray."
781 | Abu Hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kept silence between the takbir and the recitation of Qur’an. So I asked him, for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom: What do you say during you period of silence between the takbir and the recitation? He replied (that he said): O Allah, purify me from sins as a white garment is purified from filth. O Allah, wash away my sings with snow, water and hail.
782 | ‘Anas said:The Prophet(peace be upon hm), Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthman used to begin the recitation with “Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe.”
783 | ‘A’ishah said:The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) began prayer with the takbir (Allah is most great) and with reciting “Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe”. And when he bowed, he neither raised up nor lowered down his head, but kept it between the two (conditions). And when he raised his head after bowing, he did not prostrate himself until he stood up straight; and when he raised his head after prostration, he did not prostrate (the second time) until he sat down properly; and he recited al-tahiyyat after every pair of rak’ahs; and when he sat, he spread out his left foot and raised his right. He forbade to sit like the sitting of the devil, and to spread out to hands (on the ground in prostration) like animals. He used to finish prayer with uttering the salutation.
784 | Anas b. Malik said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: A surah has just been revealed to me. He then recited:”In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Lo! We have given thee Abundance” until he finished it. Then he asked: Do you know what Abundance (al-Kawthar) is? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know it better. He said: It is a river of which my Lord, the Exalted, the Majestic has promised me to give in Paradise.
785 | ‘Urwah reported on the authority of ‘A’ishah mentioning the incident of slander. She said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat and unveiled his face and said: “I take refuge in Allah, All-Hearing, All-Knowing from the accursed devil. Lo! They who spread the slander are a gang among you.”   Abu Dawud said: This is a rejected (munkar) tradition. A group of narrators have reported this tradition from al-Zuhri; but did not mention this detail. I am afraid the phrase concerning “seeking refuge in Allah” is the statement of Humaid.
786 | Narrated Uthman ibn Affan::       Yazid al-Farisi said: I heard Ibn Abbas say: I asked Uthman ibn Affan: What moved you to put the (Surah) al-Bara'ah which belongs to the mi'in (surahs) (containing one hundred verses) and the (Surah) al-Anfal which belongs to the mathani (Surahs) in the category of as-sab'u at-tiwal (the first long surah or chapters of the Qur'an), and you did not write "In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful" between them?        Uthman replied: When the verses of the Qur'an were revealed to the Prophet (ﷺ), he called someone to write them down for him and said to him: Put this verse in the surah in which such and such has been mentioned; and when one or two verses were revealed, he used to say similarly (regarding them). (Surah) al-Anfal is the first surah that was revealed at Medina, and (Surah) al-Bara'ah was revealed last in the Qur'an, and its contents were similar to those of al-Anfal. I, therefore, thought that it was a part of al-Anfal. Hence I put them in the category of as-sab'u at-tiwal (the seven lengthy surahs), and I did not write "In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful" between them.
787 | The above mentioned tradition has been reported by ibn abbas through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version adds:The apostle of Allah (ﷺ) died, but he did not mention to us that surah al baraah ins a part of al-anfal.   Abu Dawood said: Al-sha’bl, Abu Malik, Qatadah, and Thabit b. ‘Umarah said: The prophet( may peace be upon him) did not write”In the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful” until Surah al-naml was revealed. This is the meaning of what they said. Further, this is a mursal traditional(omitting the name of the companion)
788 | Ibn Abbas said:The prophet (ﷺ) did not distinguish between the two surahs until the words “In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the merciful” was revealed to him. These are the words of Ibn al-sarh.
789 | Abu Qatadah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:I stand up to pray and intend to prolong it; but when I hear the cry of a boy I shorten if for fear that his mother  might be distressed.
790 | Jabir said:Mu’adh b. Jabal used to pray along with the Prophet (ﷺ); then he returned and led us in prayer. Sometimes he (the narrator) said: then he returned and led his people in prayer. One night the Prophet (ﷺ) delayed the prayer. Sometimes he (the narrator) mentioned the word “the night prayer”. Then Mu’adh prayed along with the Prophet (ﷺ), then returned to his people and led them in prayer, and recited Surat al-Baqarah. A man turned aside and prayed alone. The people said to him: Have you become a hypocrite, so and so? He replied: I did not become a hypocrite. He then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said (to him): Messenger of Allah, Mu’adh prays along with you and then returns and leads us in prayers. We look after camels used for watering and work for by day. He came to us leading us in prayer, and he recited Surah al-Baqarah (in prayer). He (the Prophet) said: Mu’adh, are you a trouble maker? Recite such and such ; recite such and such (surahs) The narrator Abu al-Zubair said (recite) “Glorify the name of the most high lord” (surah lxxxvii) and “By the night when it covers over” (surah xcii). We mentioned this to ‘Amr. He said I think he mentioned it (the names of some surahs).
791 | Hazm b. Ubayy b. Ka’b said that he came to mu’adh b. jabal who was leading the people in the sunset  prayer.  According to this version, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:O mu’adh, do not become a trouble , because the aged, the weak, the needy and the traveler pray behind you.
792 | Narrated Some Companions of the Prophet:      AbuSalih reported on the authority of some Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ): The Prophet (ﷺ) said to a person: what do you say in prayer?       He replied: I first recite tashahhud (supplication recited in sitting position), and then I say: O Allah, I ask Thee for Paradise, and I seek refuge in Thee from Hell-Fire, but I do not understand your sound and the sound of Mu'adh (what you say or he says in prayer). The Prophet (ﷺ) said: We too go around it (paradise and Hell-fire).
793 | Jabir narrated the story of mu’adh and said:The prophet (ﷺ) said to a youth: My nephew, what do you do in prayer? He replied: I recited fatihat al-katab and I ask Allah for paradise and seek his refuge from hell-fire I do not understand well your sound and the sound of mu’adh. The prophet (ﷺ) said: I and Mu’adh go around both (paradise and Hell-fire), or he said something similar.
794 | Abu Hurairah reported the prophet (ﷺ) as saying:When one of you leads the people in prayer, he should be brief, for among them are the weak, the sick, and the aged. But when one of you prays by himself, he may pray as long as he likes.
795 | Abu Hurairah reported the prophet (ﷺ) as saying:when one of you leads the people in prayer, he should be brief, for among them are the sick, the aged and the needy.
796 | ‘Ammar b. Yasir said:I heard the apostle of Allah (ﷺ) say: A man returns after saying his prayer while a tenth part of his prayer, or a ninth part, or an eight part, or a seventh part, or a sixth part, or a fifth part, or a third part, or half of it, is recorded for him.
797 | Abu Hurairah said:In every prayer there is a recitation. We make you listen what the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) made us listen, and we keep hidden from you what he kept hidden from us.
798 | Abu Qatadah said:The apostle of Allah (ﷺ) used to lead us in prayer and recite in the first two rak’ahs of the noon prayers Fatihat al-kitab and two surahs, and he would sometimes recite loud enough for us to hear the verse. He would prolong the first rak’ah of the noon prayer and shorten the second; and he did so in the morning prayer.   Abu Dawud said: Musaddad did not mention the words fatihat al-kitab and surah.
799 | The above mentioned tradition as been reported by Abu Qatadah through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:He would recite Fatihat al-kitab in the last two surahs. Hammam added: He would prolong the first rak’ah but would not prolong the second so much; and he did so similarly in the afternoon prayer, and so in the morning prayer.
800 | Abu Qatadah said:We thought that by this (prolonging the first rak’ah). He (the prophet) meant that the people might join the first rak’ah.
801 | Abu Ma’mar said:We asked Khabbab: Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recit (the Quran) in the noon and afternoon prayers? He replied: Yes. We then asked: How did you know this? He said: By the shaking of his beard, may peace be upon him.
802 | Abd Allah b. Abl Awfa said:The prophet (ﷺ) used to stand in the rak’ah of prayer so much so that no sound of steps heard.
803 | Jabir b. Samurah reported:’Umar said to Sa’d: people complain against you for everything, even for prayer. He replied: I prolong the first two rak’ahs of prayer and make the last two rak’ahs brief; I do not fall short of following the prayer offered by the Messenger of Allah(May peace be upon him). He said: I think so about you.
804 | Abu sa’id al Khudri said:We used to estimate how long the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood in the noon and the afternoon prayer, and we estimated that he stood in the first two rak’ahs of the noon prayer as long as it takes to recite thirty verses (of the Qur’an), such as A-L-M Tanzil al-Sajdah. And we estimated that he stood in the last two rak’ahs half the time he stood in the first two rak’ahs. We estimated that he stood in the first two rak’ahs of the afternoon prayer as long as he did in the last two at noon; and we estimated that he stood in the last two rak’ahs of the afternoon prayer half the time he did in first two.
805 | Narrated Jabir ibn Samurah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite in the noon and afternoon prayer: "By the Heaven and the Morning Star" (Surah 86) and "By the Heaven , holding mansions of the stars" (Surah 85) and similar surahs of equal length.
806 | Jabir b. samurah said:When the sun declined, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered the noon prayer and recited surahs lie "By the night when it covers over" (92) and (recited similar surahs) in the afternoon prayer, and in the other prayers except the dawn prayer which he used to prolong.
807 | Ibn ‘Umr said:The prophet (ﷺ) prostrated himself in the noon prayer; then he stood up and bowed, and we knew that he recited Tanzil al-sajdah(surah xxxii).   Ibn ‘Isa said: No one narrated this tradition to Umayyah except Mu’tamir.
808 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Abdullah ibn Ubaydullah said: I went to Ibn Abbas accompanying some youths of Banu Hashim. We said to one of them: Ask Ibn Abbas: Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recite (the Qur'an) in the noon and afternoon prayers? He replied: No. People said to him: Perhaps he might recite the Qur'an quietly. He said: May your face be scratched (a kind of curse)!  This (statement) is worse than the former.       He was only a servant (of Allah) receiving Commands from Him. He preached (the divine) message which he brought with him. He did not command anything to us (Banu Hashim) specially excluding other people except three points: he commanded us to perform ablution perfectly, and not to accept charity (sadaqah) and not to make pairing of donkey with horse.
809 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      I do not know whether the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would recite the Qur'an at the noon and afternoon prayer or not.
810 | Um al-fadl daughter of al-Harith said:I heard Ibn’Abbas reciting wa’l-mursalat urfan(surah lxxxvii). She said; sonny you have reminded me of this surah by your recitation. Thie is the last surah which I heard the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) reciting in the sunset prayer.
811 | Jubair b. Mut’im said:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) reciting al-Tur(surah lii) in the sunset prayer.
812 | Marwan b. a-hakkam said:Zaid b. Thabit asked me: Why do you recite short surahs in the sunset prayer? I saw the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) reciting two long surahs at the sunset prayers. I asked him: which are those two long surahs? He replied: Al-A’raf(surah vii) and al-an’am(surah vi). I ( the narrator Ibn Juraij) asked Ibn Mulaikah (about these surahs): He said on his own accord: Al-ma’idah (surah v.) and al-A’raf(furah vii.)
813 | HIsham b . ‘Urwah said that his father (‘Umrah) used to recite the surahs as you recite like Wa’l-Adiyat(surah c).   Abu Dawud said:This indicates that those (traditions indicating long surahs) are abrogated, and this is more sound tradition.
814 | ‘Amr b. Shu’aib, on his father’s authority, quoted his grandfather as saying:There is no short or long surah in al-Mufassal which I have not heard the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) reciting when he led the people in the prescribed prayer.
815 | Abu’Uthman al-Nahdl said that he offered the sunset prayer behind Ibn mas’ud, when he recited “Say:He is Allah, the One” (Surah 112).

817 | ‘Amr b. Huraith said:As if I am hearing the voice of the prophet (may peace by upon him) who would recite at the morning prayer “Oh, but I call to witness the planets, the stars which rise and set”(surah 81:15-16)
818 | Abu sa’id said:we were commanded to recite Fatihat al-kitab and whatever was convenient (from the Qur’an during the prayer).
819 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Go out and announce in medina that prayer is not valid but the recitation of the Qur’an even though it might be fatihat al-kitab and something more.
820 | Abu hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded me to announce that prayer is not valid but with the recitation of Fatihat al-kitab and something more.
821 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying:If anyone observes a prayer in which he does not recite Umm al-Qur’an, it is incomplete, it is incomplete, it is incomplete, and deficient. (The narrator said) I said: Abu Hurairah, sometime I pray behind the imam(then what should I do)? Pressing my hand he replied: O Persian, recite it inwardly, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying that Allah, Most High, has said: I have Me and the Half for my servant and My servant will receive what he asks. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said: Recite. When the servant says: “praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe,” Allah, Most High says: “My servant has praised me.” When the servant says: “ The Compassionate, the merciful, “Allah Most High says: “My servant has lauded me.” When the servant says: “Owner of the Day of Judgment,” Allah, Most High, says: “My servant has glorified Me” When the servant says: “ Thee do we worship and of thee we ask help. “ (Allah says)  “This is between Me and My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks.” When the servant says:  “ Guide us to the Straight Path, the path of those whom thou hast favoured,  not ( the path) of those who earn thine anger nor of those who go astray,”(Allah says: ) “This is for My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks.”
822 | 'Ubadah b. al-Samit reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying :the prayer is not valid I one does not recite fatihat al-kitab and something more, sufyan( the narrator) said: This applies to a man who prays alone.
823 | Narrated Ubadah ibn as-Samit:      We were behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the dawn prayer, and he recited (the passage), but the recitation became difficult for him. Then when he finished, he said: Perhaps you recite behind your imam? We replied: Yes, it is so, Messenger of Allah. He said: Do not do so except when it is Fatihat al-Kitab, for he who does not recite it is not credited with having prayed.
824 | Nafi’b. Mahmudb. Al-Rabi’ Al-Ansari said:“Ubadah b. al-samit came to late to lead the morning prayer.  Abu Nu’aim, the mu’adhdhin, pronounced the takbir and he led the people in prayer. Then Ubadah came and I was with him. We Joined the row behind Abu Nu’aim, while Abu Nu’aim was reciting the Qur’an loudly. Then ‘Ubadah began to recite the Umm al-Quran (I.e Surah al Fatihah). When he finished, I said to Ubadah: I heard you reciting the Umm al-Qur’an while Abu Nu’aim was reciting Qur’an loudly. He replied: yes> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in a certain prayer in which the Qur’an is recited loudly, but he became confused in the recitation. When he finished he turned his face to us and said: Do you recite when I recite the Qur’an loudly? Some of us said: we do so; this is why I said to myself: What is that which confused me (in the recitation of ) the Qur’an. Do not recite anything from the Qur’an when I recite it loudly except the Umm al-Qur’an.
825 | The above mentioned tradition has been transmitted through a different chain of narrators by 'Ubadah b. al-samit like the version of al-Rabi’b Sulaiman. This version adds:Makhul used to recite Surah al Fatihah al-kitab quietly in the prayer in which the imam recites the Qur’an loudly when he observes the period of silence. If he does not observe the period of silence, recite it before him(i.e before his recitation), or along with him or after him; do not give it up in any case.
826 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished a prayer in which he had recited (the Qur'an) loudly, he asked: Did any of you recite along with me just now?  A man replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He said: I am wondering what is the matter with me that I have been contended with reciting the Qur'an. He said: When the people heard that from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) they ceased reciting (the Qur'an) along with him at the prayers in which he recited aloud.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition reported by Ibn Ukaimah has also been narrated by Ma'mar, Yunus, and Usamah b. Zaid on the authority of al-Zuhri similar to the tradition of Malik.
827 | Abu Hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in prayer, that was, we think, the dawn prayer, He further narrated this tradition up to the words “what is the matter with me that I have been contended with in (the recitation of ) the Qur’an.”   Abu Dawud said: Musaddad in his tradition said that Ma’mar said: The people ceased to recite (the Qur’an) at the prayer in which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited aloud. Ibn al-Sarh said in his version that Ma’mar reported from al-Zuhri on the authority of Abu Hurairah. Then the people ceased (to recite behind the imam). Another version says: Sufyan said: Al-Zuhri spoke a word that I could not hear. Then Ma’mar said: He said: Then people ceased (to recite the Qur’an)   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by ‘Abd al-Raman b. Ishaq on the authority of al-Zuhri. This version ends at the words: “What is the matter with me that I am contended with in (the recitation of) the Qur’an. Al-Awza’i also narrated it on the authority of al-Zuhri. This version has: Al-Zuhri said: The Muslims took lesson from that and thenceforth they did not recite (the Qur’an) at the prayer in which he (the Prophet) recited aloud.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Muhammad b. Yaya b. Faris say: The words “the people ceased to recite (the Qur’an)” is a statement of al-zuhri.
828 | Narrated Imran ibn Husayn:      The Prophet (ﷺ) led (us) in the noon prayer, and a man came and recited behind him "Glorify the name of thy Lord, the Most High" (Surah 87). When he finished (the prayer), he said: Which of you recited? They (the people) said: A man (recited). He said: I knew that some one of you confused me in it (in the recitation of the Qur'an).   Abu Dawud said: Abu al-Walid said in his version: Shu'bah said: I asked Qatadah: Did Sa'id not say: Listen attentively to the Qur'an? He replied: (Yes), but that applies to prayer in which it (the Qur'an) is recited aloud. Ibn Kathir said in his version: I said to Qatadah: Perhaps he (the Prophet) disliked it (recitation). He said: If he had disliked it, he would have prohibited it.
829 | ‘Imran b. Husain reported that the prophet of Allah (ﷺ) led them in the noon prayer. When he finished it, he said:Which of you did recite the surah “ Glorify the name of thy lord, the Most High”(Surah lxxxvii.) A man said:  I . He said: I knew that some one of you confused me in it(i.e in the recitation of the Qur’an).
830 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us while we were reciting the Qur'an, and there were among us bedouins and the non-Arabs. He said: Recite, all is well. In the near future there will appear people who will straighten it (the Qur'an) as an arrow is straightened. They will recite it quickly and not slowly (or it means that they will get the reward in this world and not in the Hereafter).
831 | Sahl b. Sa’d al-Sa’idi said:The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) one day came out to us while we were reciting the Qur’an. He said: Praise be to Allah. The Book of Allah is one, and among you are the red, and among you are the white and among you are the black. Recite it before there appear people who will recite it and straighten it as an arrow is straightened. They will get their reward for it in this world and will not get it in the Hereafter.
832 | Narrated Abdullah ibn AbuAwfa:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I cannot memorise anything from the Qur'an: so teach me something which is sufficient for me. He said: Say Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is most great, and there is no might and no strength but in Allah.        :He said: Messenger of Allah, this is for Allah, but what is for me? He said: Say: O Allah have mercy on me, and sustain me, and keep me well, and guide me. When he stood up, he made a sign with his hand (indicating that he had earned a lot).       The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He filed up his hand with virtues.
833 | Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah said:we used to offer supererogatory prayers and recite supplications while we were standing, and would glorify Allah while bowing and prostrating.
834 | The above-mention tradition has also been transmitted through a different chain of narrators by Humaid, but he did not mention the word “Supererogatory prayer” This version has:Al-Hasan (al-Basri) would recite fatihat al-kitab in the noon and afternoon prayers while he led in prayer or he was behind the imam and would glorify Allah, and would repeatedly say: “Allah is most great” and “ There is no god but Allah” (i.e takbir and tahlil) equal to the amount one recites al-Qaf (Surah 50) and al-Dhariyat(surah 51).
835 | Mutarrif said:I and ‘Imran b. Husain offered prayer behind ‘All b. AbI Talib(may Allah be pleased with him). When he prostrated, he uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) and when he bowed, he uttered the takbir and when he stood up at the end of two rak’ahs, he uttered the takbir. When we finished our prayer, ‘Imran caught hold of my hand, and said: He has led us in prayer just now like the prayer offered by Muhammed(may peace by upon him).
836 | Abu bakr b. ‘Abd al-Rahman and abu Salamah said:Abu Hurairah would utter the takbir in every prayer, whether obligatory or non-obligatory, He would utter the takbir when he stood, and he would utter the takbir when he bowed, then he would say: “Allah listens to him who praises Him”; he then would say before prostrating himself; “ Our Lord, to Thee be praise”; then he would say while falling in prostration: “Allah is most great”; he then would utter the takbir when he raised his head after prostration, and then utter the takbir when he prostrated, and then utter takbir the takbir when he stood up at the end of two rak’ahs after sitting down. He used to do so in every rak’ah until he finished his prayer. Then he would say at the end of the prayer: By Him in Whose hands lies my life, I am closer to the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) in respect of his prayer. Such was the prayer he used to offer until he departed from the world.   Abu Dawud said: Malik, al-Zubaidi and others have narrated so that they form the last words from al-Zuhri on the authority of ‘Ali b, Husain. And this is supported by the version reported by ‘Abd al-A’la from Ma’mar and SHu’aib b. Abi Hamzah on the authority of Al-Zuhri.
837 | ‘Abd al Rahman b. Abza said that he offered prayer along with the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) but he did not complete the takbir.   Abu Dawud said:This means that when he raised his head after bowing and when he was about to prostrate, he did not utter the takbir, and when he stood up after prostration, he did not utter the takbir.
838 | Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:      I saw that the Prophet (ﷺ) placed his knees (on the ground) before placing his hands when he prostrated himself. And when he stood up, he raised his hands before his knees.
839 | The above-mentioned tradition has also been transmitted by Wa’il b. Hujr through a different chain of narrators. This version has:When he prostrated himself, his knees fell on the ground before his hands had fallen. Hemmam said: This tradition has also been transmitted by ‘Asim b. Kulaib through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. And one of these two versions, and probably the version narrated by Muhammad b. Juhadah, has the words: When he stood up (after prostration), he stood up on his knees taking the support of his thighs.
840 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:when one of you prostrates himself he must not kneel in the manner of camel, but should put down his hands before his knees.

842 | Abu Qilabah said:Abu sulaiman malik b. al-Huwairith came to our mosque and said: By Allah, I Shall offer prayer; and I do not intend to pray, but I intend to show you how I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offering prayer. He (the narrator Ayyub) said: I asked Abu Qilabah: How did he pray? He replied: Like the prayer of this head after the last prostration in the first rak’ah, he used to sit, and then stand up.
843 | Abu Qilabah said:Abu Sulaiman Malik b. al-Huwairth came to our mosque, and said: By Allah, I Shall offer prayer, though I do not intend to pray; I only intend to show you how I saw the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) praying. The narrator said: ( He then prayed and ) he sat at the end of the first rak’ah when he raised his head after the last prostration.
844 | Abu Qilabah said:Malik b. al-Huwairith saw that the prophet (may peace by upon him) would not stand at the end of the first or the third rak’ah until he sat down straight.

846 | Abd Allah b. Abi Awfa said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his head after bowing, he said: Allah listens to him who praises Him. O Allah, our lord, to Thee be the praise in the heavens and in all the earth, and all that it please Thee to create afterwards.   Abu Dawud said: Sufyan al-Thawri and Shu’bah b. al-Hajjaj reported on authority of Ubaid b. al-Hasan: There is no mention of the words “after bowing” in this tradition. Sufyan said: we met al-shaikh ‘Ubaid b. al-Hasan; he did not say the words “bowing” in it.   Abu dawud said: Shu’bah narrated this from Abi ‘Ismah, from al-A’mash, on the authority of ‘Ubaid, saying: “after bowing”.
847 | Abu sa’id al-Khuri said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “ Allah listens to him who praises Him,” he also said: O Allah, our Lord, to thee be the praise in all heavens. Mu’ammil said( in his version); “ In all the heavens, and in all the earth, and in all that it pleases Thee to create afterwards. O thou Who art worthy of praise and glory, most worthy of what a servant says, and we are all thy servants, no one can withhold what thou givest or give what Thou withholdest. “The narrators then were agreed on the words: “And riches cannot avail a wealthy person with Thee.”
848 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:When the Imam says: “Allah listens to him who praised Him,” say: “O Allah, our lord, to Thee be the praise, “ for if what anyone says synchronises with what the angels say, he will be forgiven his past sins.
849 | ‘Amir said:The people behind the imam should not say: “Allah listens to him who praises Him.” But they should say: “ Our Lord, to Thee be the praise.”
850 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to say between the two prostrations: "O Allah, forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, heal me, and provide for me."
851 | Narrated Asma' daughter of AbuBakr:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: One of you who believes in Allah and in the Last Day should not raise her head until the men raise their heads (after prostration) lest they should see the private parts of men.
852 | Al-Bara’ said:The prostration observed by the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ), his bowing, and his sitting between the two prostrations were nearly equal.
853 | Anas b. Malik said:I did not offer prayer behind anyone more brief than the one offered by the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) and that was perfect. When the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said: “Allah listens to him who praises Him,” he stood long we thought that he had omitted something; then he say takbir(Allah is most great) and prostrate, and would sit between the two prostrations so long that we thought that he had omitted something.
854 | Al-Barab. Azib said:I witnessed Muhammed(ﷺ) –Abu Kamil’s version has the wording: The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ)-during his prayer. I found his standing like his bowing and prostration and his moderation in bowing was like that of his prostration, and his sitting between the two prostration and his prostration(and his sitting between the salutation) and going away( after finishing the prayer) were nearly equal to one another.   Abu Dawud said: Musaddad said: His bowing and his moderation in bowing and prostration, and his prostration and his sitting between the two prostrations, and his prostration and sitting between the salutation and going away (after finishing the prayer) were nearly equal.
855 | Narrated AbuMas'ud al-Badri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A man's prayer does not avail him unless he keeps his back steady when bowing and prostrating.
856 | Abu Hurairah said:When the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) entered the mosque, a man also entered it and prayed. He then came and saluted the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) returned the salutation and said to him: Go back and pray, for you have not prayed. The man returned and prayed as he prayed before. He then came to prophet(ﷺ) and saluted him. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said to him: “ And upon you be peace. “ Go back and pray, for you have not prayed. He did so three times. Then the man said: By Him who has sent you(as a Prophet) with truth; I cannot do better than this; so teach me. He said: When you get up to pray, utter the takbir(Allah is most great); then recite a convenient portion of the Qur’an; then bow and remain quietly in that position; then sit and remain quietly in that position; then raise yourself and stand erect: then prostrate yourself and remain quietly in that position; then sit and remain quietly in that position; then do that throughout all your prayer.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Qa’nabi reported this tradition from Sa’id b. Abi Sa’Id on the authority of Abu Hurairah. This version has the wording in the last: When you do this, then your prayer is completed. If you omit anything form this, you omit that much from your prayer. This version also has the wording: when you get up for praying, perform the abulation perfectly.
857 | Narrated Rifa'ah ibn Rafi':      A man entered the mosque...... He then narrated the tradition like the one narrated in (No.855).       This version is as follows: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The prayer of anyone is not perfect unless he performs ablution perfectly; he should then utter the takbir, and praise Allah, the Exalted, and admire Him; he should then recite the Qur'an as much as he desires. He should then say: "Allah is Most Great". Next he should bow so that all his joints return to their proper places. Then he should say: "Allah listens to the one who praises Him", and stand erect. He should then say:"Allah is most great," and should prostrate himself so that all his joints are completely at rest. Then he should say: "Allah is most great"; he should raise his head (at the end of prostration) till he sits erect. Then he should say: "Allah is most great"; then he should prostrate himself till all his joints return to their proper places. Then he should raise his head and say the takbir. When he does so, then his prayer is completed.
858 | Narrated Rifa'ah ibn Rafi':      This version (of Hadith No 856) adds: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The prayer of any of you is not complete until he performs ablution perfectly, as Allah, the Exalted, has ordered you. He should wash his face and hands up to the elbows, and wipe his head and (wash) his feet up to the ankles. Then he should exalt Allah and praise Him. Then he should recite the Qur'an as much as it is convenient for him.       (Narrator then narrated the tradition like Hammad's, No. 856). He said: He then utter the takbir and prostration himself so that his face is at rest.       Hammam (sub-narrator) said: Sometimes he reported: So that his forehead is at rest on the ground, and his joints return to their places and are loosened. Then he should say the takbir and then sit right on his hips and erect his back. He described the nature of prayer in this way by offering four rak'ahs until he finished it. The prayer of any of you is not complete unless he does so.
859 | This tradition has also been transmitted through a different chain of narrators by Rifa’ah b. Rafi. This version goes:When you get up and face the qiblah, what Allah wishes you to recite. And when you bow, put your palms on your knees and stretch out your back. When you prostrate yourself, do it completely( so that you are at the rest). When you raise yourself then sit on your left thigh.

The version adds: When you sit in the middle of the prayer, do it completely(so that you are at rest) and spread your left thigh; then recite the tashahhud. Then if you get up (again), do in a similar way until you finish your prayer.
861 | Rifa’ah b. Rafi has also narrated this tradition through a different chain from the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ). This version goes:Then perform ablution in a way Allah, the exalted, has command you, then say the shahadah and get up and say the takbir. Then if you know any of the Qur’an, recite it; otherwise say: “Praise be to Allah”; “Allah is most great”; “ There is no god but Allah” He ( the narrator) also said in this version: If some defect remains in this, that detect will remain in your prayer.
862 | Narrated AbdurRahman ibn Shibl:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited to peck like a crow, and to spread (the forearms) like a wild beast, and to fix a place in the mosque like a camel which fixes its place. These are the wordings of Qutaybah.
863 | Narrated Uqbah ibn Amr al-Ansari:      Salim al-Barrad said: We came to AbuMas'ud Uqbah ibn Amr al-Ansari and said to him: Tell us about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).       He stood up before us in the mosque and said the takbir. When he bowed, he placed his hands upon his knees and put his fingers below, and kept his elbows (arms) away from his sides, so everything returned properly to its place. Then he said: "Allah listens to him who praises Him"; then he stood up so that everything returned properly to its place; then he said the takbir and prostrated and put the palms of his hands on the ground; he kept his elbow (arms) away from his sides, so that everything returned to its proper place. Then he raised his head and sat so that everything returned to its place; he then repeated it in a similar way. Then he offered four rak'ahs of prayer like this rak'ah and completed his prayer.       Then he said: Thus we witnessed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offering his prayer.
864 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      Anas ibn Hakim ad-Dabbi said that he feared Ziyad or Ibn Ziyad; so he came to Medina and met AbuHurayrah. He attributed his lineage to me and I became a member of his lineage.       AbuHurayrah said (to me): O youth, should I not narrate a tradition to you? I said: Why not, may Allah have mercy on you?       (Yunus (a narrator) said: I think he narrated it (the tradition) from the Prophet (ﷺ):) The first thing about which the people  will be called to account out of their actions on the Day of Judgment is prayer. Our Lord, the Exalted, will say to the angels - though He knows better: Look into the prayer of My servant and see whether he has offered it perfectly or imperfectly. If it is perfect, that will be recorded perfect.       If it is defective, He will say: See there are some optional prayers offered by My servant. If there are optional prayer to his credit, He will say: Compensate the obligatory prayer by the optional prayer for My servant. Then all the actions will be considered similarly.

A man said to him: Messenger of Allah, you omitted such-and-such verse. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Why did you not remind me of it?        The narrator Sulayman said in his version: He (the man) said: I thought that it (the verse) was repealed.
907 | Ibn ‘Umar said :The Prophet (ﷺ) prayed and recited the Qur’an in it. He was then confused in it (in his recitation). When he finished (his prayer), he said to Ubayy (b. Ka’b): Did you pray along with us? He said: Yes. He said: What prevented you (from correcting me)?
908 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Ali, do not instruct the imam during the prayer.   Abu Dawud said: The narrator Abu Ishaq heard only for traditions from al-Harith, this tradition is not one of them.
909 | Narrated AbuDharr:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Allah, the Most High, continues to turn favourably towards a servant while he is engaged in prayer as long as he does not look to the side (by turning the neck), but if he does so, He turns away from him.

914 | Aishah said :the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) once prayed with a sheet of cloth upon him. It had prints and paintings. He said: The prints of this (sheet) distracted my attention; take it to Abu Jahm and bring a blanket to me.
915 | The above-mentioned tradition has also been narrated by ‘A’ishah through a different chain of transmitters.

Her mother was Zaynab daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She (Umamah) was a child and he (the Prophet) was carrying her on his shoulder.       The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led (the people) in prayer while she was on his shoulder. When he bowed he put her down and took her up when he got up. He kept on doing so until he finished his prayer.
919 | Abu Qatadah al-Ansari said:I saw the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) leading the people in prayer with Umamah daughter of Abu al-As on his neck (shoulder). When he prostrated, he put her down.   Abu Dawud said: The narrator Makhramah did not hear from his father except one tradition.
920 | Abu Qatadah, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ), said:While we were waiting for the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) for the noon or afternoon prayer, and Bilal had already called him for prayer, he came upon us with Umamah daughter of Abu al-As and daughter of his daughter on his neck. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood at the place of prayer and we stood behind him and she(Umamah) (all this time) was in her place. He uttered the takbir and we also uttered. When the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) intended to bow, he took her and put her down, and then he bowed and prostrated till he finished his prostration. He then got up and took her and returned he to her place. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) kept on doing that in every rak’ah until he finished his prayer. May peace be upon him.
921 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Kill the two black things during prayer, the snake and scorpion.
922 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was praying with his door bolted. I came and asked to have the door opened. He walked and opened the door for me. He then returned to his place for prayer. He (the narrator Urwah) mentioned that the door faced the qiblah.
923 | ‘Abd Allah(b. Mas’ud) said:We used to salute the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) while he was engaged in prayer and he would respond to our salutation, but when we returned from the Negas, we saluted him and he did not respond to us. He said : Prayer demands one’s whole attention.
924 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      We used to salute during prayer and talk about our needs. I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and found him praying. I saluted him, but he did not respond to me. I recalled what happened to me in the past and in the present.       When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he said to me: Allah, the Almighty, creates new command as He wishes, and Allah, the Exalted, has sent a fresh command that you must not talk during prayer. He then returned my salutation.
925 | Narrated Suhayb:      I passed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who was praying. I saluted him and he returned it by making a sign.       The narrator said: I do not know but that he said: He made a sign with his finger.  This is the version reported by Qutaybah.
926 | jabir said:The prophet of Allah(ﷺ) sent me to Banu al-Mustaliq. When I returned to him, he was praying on his camel. I talked to him; he made a sign to me with his hand like this. I again talked to him; he made a sign to me with his hand like this. I was hearing him reciting the Qur’an and he was making a sign with his head. When he finished his prayer, he said; what did you do about the mission for which I had sent you; nothing prevented me from talking to you except that I was praying.
927 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went to Quba to offer prayer. Then the Ansar (the Helpers) came to him and gave him a salutation while he was engaged in prayer.       I asked Bilal: How did you find the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) responding to them when they gave him a salutation while he was engaged in prayer. He replied: In this way, and Ja'far ibn Awn demonstrated by spreading his palm, and keeping its inner side below and its back side above.
928 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:There is no loss in prayer nor in salutation. Ahmad(b. Hanbal) said: This means, I think, that you do not salute nor you are saluted by others. The loss of a man in his prayer is that a man remains doubtful about it when he finishes it.
929 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet(ﷺ) as saying :There is no loss in salutation and in prayer.   Abu Dawud said: According to the version of Ibn Mahdi, this tradition has been narrated by Ibn Fudail as a statement of Abu Hurairah and not as a saying of the Prophet(ﷺ)
930 | Mu’awiyah b. al-Hakam al-Sulami said:I was praying with the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ). A man in the company sneezed, and I said: May Allah have mercy on you! The people gave me disapproving looks, so I said: Woe is to me! What do you mean by looking at me? They began to strike their hand on their thighs; then I realised that they were urging me to be silent. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer – for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom-he did not beat, scold or revile me, but said: No talk to people in lawful in this prayer, for it consists only in glorifying Allah, declaring His greatness, and reciting the Qur'an or words to that effect said by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I said: Messenger of Allah, we were only recently pagans, but Allah has brought Islam to us, and among us there are men who have recourse to soothsayers (kahins). He replied: Do not have recourse to them. I said: Among us are there are men who take omens. He replied: That is something which they find, but let it not turn them away (from what they intended to do). I said: among us there are men who draw lines. He replied: There was a prophet who drew lines; so if the line of anyone tallies with this line, that might come true. I said: A slave-girl of mine used to tend goats before (the mountain) Uhud and al-Jawaniyyah. Once when I reached her (suddenly) I found that a wolf had taken away a goat of them. I am a human being; I feel grieved as others do. But I gave her a good knocking. This was unbearable for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I asked: Should I set her free ? He replied: Bring her to me. So I brought her to him. He asked (her): Where is Allah ? She said: In the heaven. He said: Who am I ? She replied: You are the Messenger of Allah. He said: Set her free, for she is believer.
931 | Mu’awiyah b. al-Hakam al-Sulami said ; when I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) I learnt many things about islam. One of the things that I was taught was that it was that it was pointed out me. When you sneeze, praise Allah (I,e, say “praise be to Allah”); and when someone sneezes and praises Allah, say “ May Allah have mercy on you. Meanwhile I was standing along with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) during prayer, all of a sudden a man sneezed, and he praised Allah. So I said, “may Allah have mercy on you”, in a loud voice. The people  gave me disapproving looks so much so that I took ill of it. So I said :what do you mean by looking at me with furtive glances. Then they glorified Allah. When the prophet (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he asked; who was the speaker? The Prophet told him; this Bedouin. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called me and said to me: Prayer is meant for the recitation of the Quran, and making mention of Allah. When you are in it (prayer), this should be your work therein. I never saw an instructor more lenient than the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)
932 | Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited the verse "Nor of those who go astray" (Surah al-Fatihah, verse 7), he would say Amin; and raised his voice (while uttering this word).
933 | Wail b, hujr said that he prayed behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ),and he said Amin loudly and saluted at his right and left sides until I saw the whiteness of his cheek.
934 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited the verse "Not of those with whom Thou art angry, nor of those who go astray," he would say Amin so loudly that those near him in the first row would hear it.
935 | Abu Hurairah reported the prophet (ﷺ) as saying; when the imam recites “ not of those with whom thou art angry, nor of those who go astray” (surah al-fatihah,verse 7) say Amin, for  if one’s words (utterance of amin) synchronise with those of the angles, he will be forgiven his past sins.
936 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying; When the Imam says Amin, say Amin, for if anyone’s utterance of Amin synchronnises with that of the angles, he will be forgiven his past sins.   Ibn shihab (al Zuhrl) said; The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) used to say Amin (At the end of the Fatihah)
937 | Bilal reported that he said :Messenger of Allah, do not say Amin before me.
938 | Narrated AbuZuhayr an-Numayri:      AbuMisbah al-Muqra'i said: We used to sit in the company of AbuZuhayr an-Numayri. He was a companion of the Prophet (ﷺ), and he used to narrate good traditions. Once a man from among us made a supplication.  He said: End it with the utterance of Amin, for Amin is like a seal on the book.        AbuZuhayr said: I shall tell you about that. We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one night and came upon a man who made supplication with persistence. The Prophet (ﷺ) waited to hear him.  The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He will have done something which guarantees (Paradise for him) if he puts a seal to it.  One of the people asked: What should he use as a seal?  He replied: Amin, for if he ends it with Amin, he will do something which guarantees (Paradise for him).        Then the man who questioned the Prophet (ﷺ) came to the man who was supplicating, and said to him: So-and-so, end it with Amin and receive the good news. These are the words of Mahmud.    Abu Dawud said: Al-Muqra'i is a clan of Himyar.
939 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying; Glorifying Allah applies to men and clapping applies only to women.
940 | Sahl b. Sa’d said :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went to Banu ‘Amr b. ‘Awf to effect reconciliation between them . in the meantime the time of prayer came and the Mu’adhdhin came to Abu Bakr and asked : Will you lead the people in prayer? I pronounce the Iqamah. He said ; Yes. So Abiu Bakr led the prayer , and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came back while the people were praying. He penetrated through the rows and stood in the first row. The people clapped but Abu Bakr did not pay any attention to it during prayer. When the people clapped increasingly, he paid attention. He saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a sign to him (saying); Stay at your place. Abu BAkr raised his hands and praised Allah for the commandment the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had given him (to lead the people in prayer). Abu Bakr then stepped back and stood in the row. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stepped forward and led the prayer. When he finished the prayer, he said; Abu Bakr, what prevented you staying (at your place) when I already commented you to do so? Abu Bakr said ; it was not befitting for the son of Abu Quhafah (Abu Bakr) to lead the prayer in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said; What is the matter that I saw you clapping frequently during prayer? If anything happens to someone during prayer, he should say  “Glory be to Allah,” for when he glorifies Allah. He pays attention to him. Clapping applies only to women.   Abu Dawud said: This is operative in the obligatory prayer.
941 | sahl b. Sa’d said; Fighting took place amongst the tribe of Banu ‘Amr b. ‘Awf. This (the news) reached the prophet (May peace be upon him). He came to them for their reconciliation after the noon prayer . he said to Bilal; If the time of the afternoon prayer comes, and I do not return to you, then ask Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer. When the time of the afternoon prayer came, Bilal called the Adhan and pronounced the Iqamah and then asked Abu Bakr (to lead the prayer). He stepped forward. The narrator reported this tradition to the same effect. In the end he (the prophet) said; if anything happens to you during prayer, the men should say” Glory be to Allah,” and the women should clap.
942 | ‘Isa b. Ayyub said:Clapping by women means that one should strike her left hand with the two fingers of her right hand.
943 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to make a sign during prayer.
944 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Saying Tasbih applies to men during prayer and clapping applies to women. Anyone who makes a sign during his prayer, a sign which is intelligible by implication, should repeat it (i.e. his prayer).       (AbuDawud commented on the Hadith saying, this is a result of confusion.)
945 | Narrated AbuDharr:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When one of you gets up to pray, he must not remove pebbles, for mercy is facing him.
946 | Mu’aiqib reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying ; Do not remove pebbles while you are praying; if you do it out of sheer necessity, do it only once to smooth the pebbles.
947 | Abu hurairah said that the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) forbade putting hands on the waist during prayer.   Abu Dawud said; The word Ikhtisar means to put one’s hands on one’s waist.
948 | Narrated Umm Qays bint Mihsan:      Hilal ibn Yasaf said: I came to ar-Raqqah (a place in Syria). One of my companions said to me: Do you want to see any of the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ)? I said: A good opportunity. So we went to Wabisah.       I said to my friend: Let us first see his mode of living. He had a cap with two ears stuck (to his head), and wearing a brown silken robe. He was resting on a staff during prayer. We asked him (about resting on the staff) after salutation; He said: Umm Qays daughter of Mihsan said to me that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) became aged and the flesh grew increasingly on him, he took a prop at his place of prayer and rested on it.
949 | Zaid b. Arqam said ; One of us used to speak to the man standing by his side during prayer. Then the Quranic verse “ And stand up with devotion to Allah”
950 | ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Amr said :It has been narrated to me that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said : The Prayer of a man in sitting condition is half the prayer (wins him half the reward of prayer). I came to him and found him prayer in sitting condition. I placed my hand on my head (in surprise). He said: what is the matter,’Abd Allah b. ‘Amr? I said; Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) you have been reported to me as saying : the prayer of a man in sitting condition is half the prayer , but you are praying in sitting condition. He said: yes, but I am not like one of you.
951 | ‘Abd Allah b. Buraidah said :‘Imran b. Hussain asked the prophet (ﷺ) about the prayer a man offers in sitting condition. He replied: his prayer in standing condition is better than his prayer in sitting condition, and his prayer in sitting condition is half the prayer he offers in standing condition, and his prayer in lying condition is half the prayer he offers in sitting condition.
952 | ‘Imran b. Husain said :I had a fistula; so I asked the prophet (ﷺ). He said: offer prayer in standing condition; if you are unable to do so, then in sitting condition: if you are then at your side(i.e, in lying condition).
953 | ‘A’ishah said :I never saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) reciting the Quraan in his prayer at night in sitting condition until he became old. Then he used to sit in it (the prayer) and recite the Quran until forty or thirty verses remained, then he stood and recited them and prostrated himself.
954 | ‘A’ishah, wife of the prophet (ﷺ), said:when the prophet (ﷺ) prayed sitting, he recited the Quran in sitting condition. When the amount of his recitation remained about thirty or forty verses he stood up and recited them standing. He then bowed and prostrated and then did so in the second Rak’ah of the prayer.   Abu Dawud said: 'Alqamah b. Waqqas narrated this tradition on the authority of 'Aishah from the Prophet (ﷺ) to the same effect.
955 | ‘A’ishah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray standing at night for a long time, and used to pray sitting at night for a long time. When he prayed standing, he bowed standing, and when he prayed sitting, he bowed sitting.
956 | ‘Abd Allah b. Shaqiq said:I asked ‘A’ishah whether the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited a whole Surah (of the Quran) in one Rak’ah of the prayer. She replied : (He recited from among) the Mufassal surahs. I asked: Did he pray (at night) sitting? She replied : (he prayed sitting) when the people made him old.
957 | Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:      I said that I should look at the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) how he prays. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and faced the qiblah (i.e. the direction of Ka'bah) and uttered the takbir (Allah is most great); then he raised his hands till he brought them in front of his ears; then he caught hold of his left hand with his right hand (i.e. folded his hands).       When he was about to bow, he raised them (his hands) in a like manner. Then he sat, stretched out his left foot (to sit on it), placed his left hand on his left thigh, and kept away the tip of his right elbow from his right thigh, joined two fingers, formed a ring, to do so. And the narrator Bishr made a ring with the thumb and the middle finger.
958 | 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said:"A Sunnah of the prayer is that you should raise your right foot, and make your left foot lie (on the ground)."
959 | (There is another chain) reported from Yahya who said:"I heard Al-Qasim saying: "Abdullah bin 'Abdullah informed me that he heard 'Abdullah bin 'Umar saying: "From the Sunnah of the prayer is to lay your left foot on the ground, and raise your right foot."
960 | (There is another chain) from Yahya with his chain and similar (to the previous hadith). Abu Dawud said:Hammad bin Zaid also said (the wording): "From the Sunnah" (narrating) from Yahya just as Jarir did.
961 | (There is another chain) from Yahya bin Sa'eed that Al-Qasim bin Muhammad saw them sitting in Tashah-hud, so he mentioned the Hadith.
962 | It was reported from Ibrahim that he said:"When the Prophet (ﷺ) would sit in the prayer, he would place his left foot horizontally - so much so that the upper-part of his foot became black."
963 | Abu Humaid al-sa’idi said (in the presence of ten compansions of the prophet):I am more informed than any of you regarding the manner in which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered his prayer. They said: Present it. The narrator then reported the tradition, saying: he bent the toes of his feet turning them towards the Qiblah when he prostrated, then he uttered “ Allah is most great,” and raised (his head), and bent his left foot and sat on it, and he did the same in the second Rakah. The narrator then transmitted the tradition, and added: In the prostration (i.e., the Rakah) which ended at the salutation, he sat on the hips at the left side. ahmad (b. Hanbal) added: they said : You are right. This is how he used to pray. They (Ahmed and Musaddad) did not mention in their versions how he sat after offering two rak’ahs of prayer.
964 | Muhammad b. ‘Amr b.’Ata’ was sitting in the company of a few Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He then narrated his tradition, but he did not mention  the name of Abu Qatadah. He said:When he( the Prophet) sat up the two rak’ahs he sat on his left foot; and when sat up after the last rak’ah he put out his left foot and sat on his hip.
965 | Muhammad b. ‘Amr al-Amir said:I was sitting in the company( of the Companions). He then narrated this tradition saying: When he(the Prophet) sat up after two rak’ahs, he sat on the sole of his left foot and raised his left foot. When he sat up after four rak’ahs, he placed his left hip on the ground and put out his both feet on one side.
966 | ’Abbas or ‘Ayyash b. Sahl al-Sa’id that he attended a company in which his father was also present. He then narrated this tradition saying:He(the Prophet) prostrated himself, he depended on his palms, knees and the toes of his feet. When he sat up, he sat on his hips, and raised his other foot. He then uttered the takbir(Allah is most great) and prostrated himself. He uttered the takbir  and stood up and did not sit on his hips. Then he repeated(the same) and offered the second rak’ah; he uttered the takbir in the same manner, and sat up after two rak’ahs. When he was about to stand up, he stood up after saying the takbir. Then he offered the last two rak’ahs. When he saluted, he saluted on his right and left sides.   Abu Dawud said: in this tradition there is no mention of sitting on hips and raising hands when he stood  after two rak’ahs as narrated by ‘Abu al-Hamid.
967 | ‘Abbas b. Sahl said:Abu Humaid, Abu usaid, Sahl b. Sa’d and Muhammad b. Maslamah got together. Then he narrated this tradition. He did not mention the raising of hands when he stood after two rak’ahs, nor did he mention sitting. He said: When he finished (his prostration), he spread his foot (on the ground) and turned the toes of his right feet towards the qiblah(and then he sat on his left foot).
968 | ‘Abd  Allah b. Mas’ud said:when we (prayed and) sat up during prayer along the Messenger of Allah (may peach be upon him), we said: “Peace be to Allah before it is supplicated for His servants; peace be to so and so. “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do not say “Peace be to Allah ,”for Allah Himself is peace. When one of you sits(during the prayer), he should say: The adoration of the tongue are due to Allah, and acts of worship and all good things. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and Allah’s mercy and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon Allah’s upright servants. When you say that, it reaches every upright servant in heavens and earth or between heavens and earth. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and apostle. Then he may choose any supplication which pleases him and offer it.
969 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      We did not know what we should say when we sat during prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was taught (by Allah). He then narrated the tradition to the same effect. Sharik reported from Jami', from AbuWa'il on the authority of Abdullah ibn Mas'ud something similar.        He said: He used to teach us also some other words, but he did not teach them as he taught us the tashahhud: O Allah, join our hearts, mend our social relationship, guide us to the path of peace, bring us from darkness to light, save us from obscenities, outward or inward, and bless our ears, our eyes, our hearts, our wives, our children, and relent toward us; Thou art the Relenting, the Merciful. And make us grateful for Thy blessing and make us praise it while accepting it and give it to us in full.
970 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      Alqamah said that Abdullah ibn Mas'ud caught hold of his hand saying that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) caught hold of his (Ibn Mas'ud's) hand and taught him the tashahhud during prayer.        He then narrated the (well known ) tradition (of tashahhud). This version adds: When you say this or finish this, then you have completed your prayer. If you want to stand up, then stand, and if you want to remain sitting, then remain sitting.
971 | Ibn ‘Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:The adoration of the tongue are due to Allah, and acts of worship, all good things. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and Allah’s mercy and His blessings. Ibn ‘Umar said: I added: “And Allah’s blessings, peace be upon us, and upon Allah’s upright servants. I testify that there is not god but Allah. “Ibn ‘Umar said: I added to it: He is alone, no one is His associate, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and His Apostle.
972 | Narrated AbuMusa al-Ash'ari:      Hittan ibn Abdullah ar-Ruqashi said: AbuMusa al-Ash'ari led us in prayer.        When he sat at the end of his prayer, one of the people said: Prayer has been established by virtue and purity.        When AbuMusa returned (from his prayer or finished his prayer), he gave his attention to the people, and said: Which of you is the speaker of such and such words? The people remained silent. Which of you is the speaker of such and such words? The people remained silent. He said: You might have said them, Hittan.  He replied: I did not say them. I was afraid you might punish me.  One of the people said: I said them and I did not intend by them (anything) except good.        AbuMusa said: Do you not know how you utter (them) in your prayer? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us, and taught us and explained to us our way of doing and taught us our prayer.        He said: When you pray a (congregational) prayer, straighten your rows, then one of you should lead you in prayer. When he says the takbir (Allah is Most Great), say the takbir, and when he recites verses "Not of those upon whom is Thy anger, nor of those who err" (i.e. the end of Surah i.), say Amin; Allah will favour you. When he says "Allah is most great," and bows, say "Allah is most great" and bow, for the imam will bow before you, and will raise (his head) before you.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is for that. When he says "Allah listens to the one who praises Him," say: "O Allah, our Lord, to Thee be praise, Allah be praised," Allah will listen to you, for Allah, the Exalted, said by the tongue of His Prophet (ﷺ): "Allah listens to the one who praises Him." When he says "Allah is most great" and prostrates, say: "Allah is most great" and prostrate, for the imam prostrates before you and raises his head before you.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is for that. When he sits, each one of you should say "The adorations of the tongue, all good things, and acts of worship are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon Allah's upright servants. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Apostle."    This version of Ahmad does not mention the words "and His blessings" nor the phrase "and I testify"; instead, it has the words "that Muhammad."
973 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Hittan b. ‘Abd Allah al-Ruqashi through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:When he( the imam) recites the Qur’an, keep silence(and listen attentively). And in the tashahhud this version adds after the words “I testify that there is no god but Allah” the words “He is alone, and there is no associate of Him.”   Abu Dawud said: His word "And keep silence" is not guarded; it has been narrated by Sulaiman al-Taimi alone in his version.
974 | Ibn ‘Abbas  said:The Messenger of Allah( may peace be upon him)  used to teach us the tashahhud as he would teach us the Qur’an, and would say: The blessed adoration of the tongue, acts of worship (and) all good things are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and Allah’s mercy and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon Allah’s upright servants. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is Allah’s apostle (peace be upon him).
975 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us (to recite) when we sit in the middle of the prayer or at its end before the salutation: The adorations of the tongue, all good things, acts of worship, and the Kingdom are due to Allah. Then give salutation to the right side; then salute your reciter (i.e. the imam) and yourselves.    Abu Dawud said: Sulaiman b. Musa hails from Kufah and he lives in Damascus.   Abu Dawud said: This collection of traditions indicates that al-Hasan (al-Basri) heard traditions from Samurah (b. Jundub).
976 | Ka’b b. ‘Ujrah said:We said or the people said: Messenger of Allah, you have commanded us to invoke blessing on you and to salute you. As regards salutation we have already learnt it. How should we invoke blessing? He said: Say: “O Allah, bless Muhammad and Muhammad’s family as Thou didst bless Abraham and Abraham’s family. O Allah, grant favours to Muhammad and Muhammad’s family as Thou didst grant favours to Abraham; Thou art indeed praiseworthy and glorious.
977 | This tradition has also been reported by Shu’bah through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:Bless Muhammad and Muhammad’s family as Thou didst bless Abraham.
978 | This has been transmitted by al-Hakam through a different chain of narrators. This version has:O Allah, bless Muhammad and Muhammad’s family as didst bless Abraham. Thou art indeed praiseworthy and glorious. O Allah grant favours of Muhammad and Muhammad’s family as Thou didst grant favour to Abraham’s family. Thou art indeed praiseworthy and glorious.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by al-Zubair b. ‘Adi as narrated by Mis’ar , except that his version goes: As Thou didst bless Abraham’s family. Thou art indeed praiseworthy and glorious. And grant favours to Muhammad. He then narrated the tradition in full.
979 | Abu Humaid al-Said said:Some people asked: Messenger of Allah, how should we invoke blessings on you? He said: Say,” O Allah, bless Muhammad, his wives and his off springs, as Thou didst bless Abraham’s family, and grant favours to Muhammad’s family, his wives and off springs, as Thou didst grant favours to Abraham’s family. Thou art indeed praiseworthy and glorious.
980 | Abu Mas’ud al-Ansari said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us in a meeting of Sa’d b. ‘Ubadah. Bashir b. Sa’d said to him: Allah has commanded us to invoke blessings on you, Messenger of Allah. How should we invoke blessings on you? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kept silence so much so that we wished he would not ask him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Say. He then narrated the tradition like that of Ka’b b. ‘Ujrah. This version adds in the end: In the universe, Thou art praiseworthy and glorious.
981 | This tradition has also been reported by ‘Uqbah b. ‘Amr through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:Say, O Allah, bless Muhammad, the Prophet, the unlettered, and Muhammad’s family.

Thou art indeed praiseworthy and glorious.
983 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:When one of you finishes the last tashahhud, he should seek refuge in Allah from four things: the punishment in Hell, the punishment in the grave, the trail of life and death, and the evil of Antichrist.
984 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to say after the tashahhud: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from the punishment in Hell, and I seek refuge in Thee from the punishment in the grave, and I seek refuge in Thee from the trial of antichrist, and I seek refuge in Thee from the trial of life and death."
985 | Narrated Mihjan ibn al-Adra':      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered the mosque and saw a man who had finished his prayer, and was reciting the tashahhud saying: O Allah, I ask you, O Allah, the One, the eternally besought of all, He begetteth not, nor was He begotten, and there is none comparable unto Him, that you may forgive me my sins, you are Most Forgiving, Merciful.       He (the Prophet) said: He was forgiven (repeating three times.)
986 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      It pertains to the sunnah to utter the tashahhud quietly.
987 | ’Abd al-Rahman al-Mu’awl said:‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar saw me playing with pebbles during prayer. When he finished his prayer, he forbade me (to do so) and said: Do as the Apostle (ﷺ) used to do.

989 | Narrated Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to point with his finger (at the end of the tashahhud) and he would not move it.     Ibn Juraij said: "And 'Amr bin Dinar added: 'He (Ziyad) said: "'Amir informed me from his father that he saw the Prophet (ﷺ) supplicating like that. And the Prophet (ﷺ) would brace himself with his left hand on his left knee.
990 | ‘Abd Allah b. al-Zubair narrated the above mentioned tradition on the authority of his father saying:He kept his look fixed on the finger he was pointing.

According to the version of Ibn Rafi', he prohibited that a man should pray while he is leaning on his hand, and he mentioned this tradition in the chapter on "Raising the head after prostration."       According to the version of Ibn AbdulMalik, he prohibited that a man should lean on his hand when he stands up after prostration.
993 | Isma’ll b. Umayyah said:I asked about a man who intertwines his fingers while he is engaged in prayer. He said that Ibn ‘Umar had said: This is the prayer of those who earn the anger of Allah.
994 | Nafi said:Ibn ‘Umar saw a man resting on his left hand while he was sitting during prayer. The version of Harun b. Zaid goes: He was lying on his left side. the agreed version goes: he said to him: Do not sit like this, because those who are punished sit like this.
995 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Prophet (ﷺ) was in the first two rak'ahs as though he were on heated stones.       The narrator Shu'bah said: We said: Till he (the Prophet) got up.
996 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to give the salutation to his left and right sides until the whiteness of his cheek was seen, (saying: "Peace be upon you, and mercy of Allah" twice.        AbuDawud said: This is a version of the tradition reported by AbuSufyan. The version of Isra'il did not explain it. AbuDawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Zubayr from AbuIshaq and Yahya ibn Adam from Isra'il from AbuIshaq from AbdurRahman ibn al-Aswad from his father from Alqamah on the authority of Abdullah ibn Mas'ud.

998 | Jabir b. Samurah said:When we prayed behind the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ), one of us gave the salutation and pointed with his hand to the man to his right side and left side. When he finished his prayer, he said: What is the matter that one of you points with his hand (during prayer) just like the tails of restive horses. It is sufficient for one of you, or is it not sufficient for one of you to say in this manner? And he pointed with his finger; one should salute his brother at his right and left side.
999 | The aforesaid tradition has also been narrated by Mis’ar through a different chain of transmitters to the same effect.

1003 | Ibn Abbas said :To raise the voice for making the mention of Allah after the people had finished their obligatory prayer was for in vogue the time of the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him).   Ibn ‘Abbas said : I used to know by it when they finished the prayer and would listen to it (making the mention of Allah).
1004 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Shortening the salutation is sunnah (commendable).    The narrator 'Isa said: Ibn al-Mubarak prohibited me from reporting this tradition as a statement of the Prophet (ﷺ).   Abu Dawud said: I heard Abu 'Umar 'Isa b. Yunus al-Fakhuri al-Ramil saying: When al-Firyabi returned from Mecca, he gave up narrating this tradition as a statement of the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: Ahmad b. Hanbal forbade to report this tradition directly from the Prophet (ﷺ).

1007 | Narrated Al-Azraq ibn Qays:      An imam of ours, whose kunyah (surname) was AbuRimthah, led us in prayer and said: I prayed this prayer, or one like it, with the Prophet (ﷺ). AbuBakr and Umar were standing in the front row on his right and there was a man who had been present at the first takbir in the prayer. The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) offered the prayer, then gave the salutation to his right and his left so that we saw the whiteness of his cheeks, then turned away as AbuRimthah (meaning himself) had done.        The man who has been present with him at the first takbir in the prayer then got up to pray another prayer, whereupon Umar leaped up and, seizing him by the shoulders, shook him and said: Sit down, for the People of the Book perished for no other reason than that there was no interval between their prayers.        The Prophet (ﷺ) raised his eyes and said: Allah has made you say what is right, son of al-Khattab.    Abu Dawud said: Sometimes the name of Abu Umayyah is narrated instead of Abu Rimthah.
1008 | Abu Hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led  us in one of the evening (‘Asha) prayers, noon or afternoon. He led us in two Rak’ahs and gave the salutation. He then got up going towards a piece of wood which was placed in the front part of the mosque. He placed his hands upon it, one on the other, looking from his face as if he were angry. The people came out hastily saying: the prayer has been shortened. Abu Bakr and ‘Umar were among the people, but they were too afraid to speak to him. A man whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would call “ the possessor of arms” (Dhu al-Yadain) stood up (asking him): Have you forgotten. The Messenger of Allah, or has the prayer been shortened? He said: I have neither forgotten nor has it been shortened. He said : Messenger of Allah , you have forgotten. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned towards the people and asked : did the possessor of arms speak the truth? They made a sign , that is, yes. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned to his place and prayed the remaining two Rak’ahs, then gave the salutation; he then uttered the takbir and prostrated himself as usual or prolonged. He then raised his head and uttered the takbir; then he uttered the takbir and made prostration as usual or made longer (prostration). Then he raised his head his and uttered the takbir (Allah is most great). The narrator Muhammad was asked : Did he give the salutation (while prostrating) dueto forgetfulness? He said : I do not remember it from Abu Hurairah. But we Are sure that ‘Imran b. Husain (in his version) said; he then gave the salutation.
1009 | This tradition has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters; but the version of Hammad is more perfect. This version goes; then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed; it does not have the words, “led us (in prayer),” nor the words “they made a sign”. Thereupon the people said :Yes. He then raised his head. The version does not mention the words “he uttered the takbir. He then uttered the takbir and made the prostration as usual or prolonged it. He then raised his head”. The narrator then prostration as usual or prolonged it. He then raised his head”. The narrator then finished the tradition and did not mention the words that follow it. He did not mention the words “they made a sign”, but Hammad b. Zaid mentioned them in his version.   Abu dawud said: Anyone who narrated this tradition did not mention the words “ then he uttered the takbir”, nor the words “he returned”
1010 | Abu Hurairah said ; The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in prayer. He then narrated the same version reported by Hammad up to the words “we are sure that ‘Imran b. Husain said:then he gave the salutation.”  The narrator said: I asked; What about the Tashahud? He replied: I did not hear  thing about the tashahhud, but it is more liking to me that one should recite the tashahhud. This version has not the words “whom he called the possessor of arms(Dhu al-yadain).” Nor the words “they made a sign,” nor the word “anger”. The tradition narrated by Hammad from Ayyub is more perfect.
1011 | The above mentioned tradition has also been narrated by Abu Hurairah through a different chain of transmitters. This version goes :the Prophet (ﷺ) uttered the takbir and prostrated himself (in a tradition relating to the incidence of the possessor of arms [Dhu al-yadain]). The narrator Hisham, I,e, Ibn Hassan said: he uttered the takbir ; then he uttered the takbir and prostrated himself.   Abu Dawud said : This tradition has also been narrated by Habib b. al-shahid, Humaid, Yunus, and Asim b. al-Ahwal, from Muhammad on the authority of abu Hurairah none of them mentioned what Hammad b. Zaid mentioned from from Hisham that he uttered the takbir; then uttered the takbir and prostrated himself. Hammad b. Sulaimah and Abu BAkr b. ‘Ayyash also narrated this tradition from Hisham, but they did not narrate from him what HAmmad b. zaid narrated that he uttered the takbir and again uttered the takbir.
1012 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Abu Hurairah through a different chain of narrators. This version goes:he did not make two prostrations (at the end of prayer) due to forgetfulness until Allah gave him satisfaction about it.
1013 | Ibn Shihab (al-Zuhr) reported on the authority of Abu Bakr b. Sulaiman b. Abi Hathmah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not make two prostrations when are made when one is doubtful until the people met him.   Abu Dawud said; this tradition has also been transmitted by al-Zahidi from al-zuhr from Abu Bakr b. Sulaiman b. Abi HAthman from thre prophet  (ﷺ). This version goes :he did not make two prostrations on account of forgetfulness.
1014 | Abu Hurairah reported; The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the noon prayer and he gave the salutation at the end of two rakahs. He was asked. Has the prayer been shortened ? then he offered two rakahs of the prayer and made two prostrations (at the end of it).
1015 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) finished two rak'ahs of an obligatory prayer, a man asked him: Messenger of Allah, has the prayer been shortened, or have you forgotten? he replied: I did not do all that. The people said: Messenger of Allah, you did that. Therefore, he offered another two rak'ahs or prayer and did not make two prostrations due to forgetfulness.     Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been narrated by Dawud al-Hussain from Abu Sufyan, freed slave of Ibn Abi Ahmad on the authority of Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ). This version goes: He then made two prostrations while he was sitting after the salutation.
1016 | Abu Hurairah reported; He then made two prostration on account of forgetfulness after he had given the salutation.
1017 | Ibn ‘Umar said :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in prayer and gave the salutation after two rakahs of prayer. He narrated this tradition like that of Ibn Sirin from Abu Hurairah. This version adds; he gave the salutation and prostrated two prostrations due to forgetfulness.
1018 | ‘Imran b. Husain said :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave the salutation at the end of three rakahs in the afternoon prayer, then went into the apartment (according to the version of maslamah). A man called al-Khirbaq who had long arms got up and said ; has the prayer been shortened, Messenger of Allah ? He came out angrily trailing his cloak and said : Is he telling the truth ? they said; Yes. He then prayed that rakah, then gave the salutation, then made two prostrations, then gave the salutation.
1019 | ‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) said :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed five rak’ahs in the noon prayer. He was asked whether the prayer had been extended. He asked what they meant by that. The people said : you prayed five rak’ahs. Then he made two prostrations after having given the salutation.
1020 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered prayer. The version of the narrator Ibrahim goes: I do not know whether he increased or decreased (the rak'ahs of prayer).       When he gave the salutation, he was asked: Has something new happened in the prayer, Messenger of Allah? He said: What is it? They said: You prayed so many and so many (rak'ahs). He then relented his foot and faced the Qiblah and made two prostrations. He then gave the salutation. When he turned away (finished the prayer), he turned his face to us and said: Had anything new happened in prayer, I would have informed you. I am only a human being and I forget just as you do; so when I forget, remind me, and when any of you is in doubt about his prayer he should aim at what is correct, and complete his prayer in that respect, then give the salutation and afterwards made two prostrations.
1021 | This tradition has also been transmitted by ‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) through a different chain of narrators. This version goes; when one of you forgets (in his prayer), he should perform two prostrations. Then he turned away, and performed two prostrations (due to forgetfulness).   Abu Dawud said:The narrator Husain also reported it like al-A'mash.
1022 | ‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) said; The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in five rak’ahs of prayer. When he turned away (i,e, finished his prayer), the people whispered among themselves. He asked; what is the matter with you ? They said :Messenger of Allah, has (the number of the rak’ahs of) the prayer been increased ? he said : No. they said; you have offered five rak’ahs of prayer. He then turned away and performed two prostrations, and afterwards gave the salutation. He then said : I am only a human being, I forget, as you forget.
1023 | Narrated Mu'awiyah ibn Khudayj:      One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed and gave the salutation while a rak'ah of the prayer remained to be offered. A man went to him and said: You forgot to offer one rak'ah of prayer. Then he returned and entered the mosque and ordered Bilal (to utter the Iqamah). He uttered the Iqamah for prayer. He then led the people in one rak'ah of prayer. I stated it to the people. They asked me: Do you know who he was? I said: No, but I can recognise him if I see him. Then the man passed by me, I said: It is he. The people said: This is Talhah ibn Ubaydullah.
1024 | ‘Ata’ b. Yasar said that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:when one of you is in doubt about his prayer (i.e, how much he has prayed), he should throw away his doubt and base his prayer on what he is sure of. When he is sure about the completion of his prayer, he should make two prostrations (at the end of the prayer). If the prayer is complete, the additional rak’ah and the two prostrations will be supererogatory prayer. If the prayer is incomplete, the additional rak’ahs will compensate it, and the two prostrations will be a disgrace for the devil.
1025 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) named the two prostrations of forgetfulness disgraceful for the devil.
1026 | Narrated Ata' ibn Yasar:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When one of you is in doubt about his prayer, and does not know how much he has prayed, three or four rak'ahs, he should pray one (additional) rak'ah and make two prostrations while sitting before giving the salutation. If the (additional) rak'ah which he prayed is the fifth one, he will make it an even number by these two prostrations. If it is the fourth one, the two prostrations will be a disgrace for the devil.
1027 | Zaid b. Aslam reported on the authority of the chain of Malik:The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If one of you is in doubt about his prayer, and if he is sure that he prayed three rak'ah, he should stand and complete one rak'ah along with its prostrations. Then he should sit and recite the tashahhud. When he finishes the prayer, and there remains nothing except salutation, he should make two prostrations while he is sitting and afterwards should give the salutation. The narrator then narrated the tradition similar to that of Malik.      Abu Dawud said: Similarly, this tradition has been narrated by Ibn Wahb from Malik, Hafs b. Maisarah, Dawud b. Qais and Hisham b. Sa'd. But Hisham projected it to Abu Sa'id al-Khudri.
1028 | AbuUbaydah reported, on the authority of his father Abdullah (ibn Mas'ud), the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:When you offer the prayer, and you are in doubt about the number of rak'ahs whether offered three or four, and you have prayed four rak'ahs in all probability in your opinion, you should recite tashahhud and make two prostrations while you are sitting before giving the salutation. afterwards you should recite the tashahhud and give the salutation again.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by 'Abd al-Wahid from Khusaif, but he did not report it as a statement of the Prophet (ﷺ). The version of 'Abd al-Wahid has been corroborated by Sufyan, Sharik, and Isra'il. They differed amongst themselves about the text of the tradition and they did not narrate it with the continuous chain up to the Prophet (ﷺ).
1029 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When one of you prays, and he does not know whether he prayed more or less rak'ahs (than those prescribed by the Shari'ah), he should perform two prostrations while he is sitting. If the devil comes to him, and tells him (suggests him): "You have been defiled," he should say: "You have told a lie," except that he feels smell with his nose, or sound with his ears (then his ablution will break). These are the wording; of the tradition reported by Aban.    Abu Dawud said: Ma'mar and 'Abi b. al-Mubarak mentioned the name "Iyad b. Hilal and al-Awza'i mentioned the name of Iyad b. Abi Zuhair.
1030 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying; When one of you stands up to pray, the devil comes to him and confuses him so that he does not know how much he has prayed. If any of you has such an experience, he should perform two prostrations while he is sitting.   Abu Dawud said; This tradition has been narrated in a similar manner by Ibn ‘Uyainab, Ma’mar and al-Laith.
1031 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Muhammad b. Muslim through a different chain of narrators. This version adds; “While he is sitting before he gives the salutation.”

When he stood up and did not sit (at the end of two rak'ahs) the people stood up along with him. When he finished the prayer  and we expect him to give the salutation, he said: "Allah is most great." While sitting and made two prostrations before giving the salutation. Then he gave it.
1035 | This tradition (mentioned above) has also been transmitted by al-Zuhri through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version adds:Some of us recited the Tashahhud while they were standing.   Abu Dawud said: Ibn-Zubair made two prostrations before giving the salutation in a similar way when he stood up at the end of two rak’ahs. This is the opinion of al-Zuhrl.
1036 | Narrated Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When an imam stands up at the end of two rak'ahs , if he remembers before standing straight up, he should sit down, but if he stands straight up, he must not sit down, but perform the two prostrations of forgetfulness.     Abu Dawud said: I have not narrated in this book of mine any hadith from Jabir Al-Ju'fi (one of the narrators) except this one.
1037 | Narrated Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah:      Ziyad ibn Ilaqah said: Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah led us in prayer and he stood up at the end of two rak'ahs. We said: Glory be to Allah; he also said: Glory be to Allah, and he proceeded. When he finished the prayer and gave the salutation, he made two prostrations of forgetfulness. When he turned (to us) he said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) doing so as I did.   Abu Dawud said: Ibn Abi Laila narrated this tradition in a similar manner from al-Shaibi from al-Mughirah b. Shu'bah. Abu 'Umais narrated it from Thabit b. 'Ubaid saying: "Al-Mughirah b. Shu'bah led us in prayer, like the tradition reported by Ziyad b. 'Illaqah.   Abu Dawud said: Abu 'Umais is the brother of al-Mas'udi. And Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas did the same as done by al-Mughirah, 'Imran b. Husain, Dahhak b. Qais and Mu'awiyah b. Abi Sufyan. Ibn 'Abbas and 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz issued legel verdict to the same effect.   Abu Dawud said: This applies to a person who stands up at the end of two rak'ahs and males prostration after giving the salutation.
1038 | Narrated Thawban:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: For each forgetfulness there are two prostrations after giving the salutation.       No one except Amr (ibn Uthman) mentioned the words "from his father" (in the chain AbdurRahman ibn Jubayr ibn Nufayr from Thawban).
1039 | Narrated Imran ibn Husayn:      The Prophet (ﷺ) led them in prayer and forgot something, so he made prostrations and uttered the tashahhud, then gave the salutation.
1040 | Umm Salamah said; When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave the salutation, he stayed for a while. By this people thought that women should return earlier than men.
1041 | Narrated Hulb (Yazid) at-Ta'i:      Hulb prayed along with the Prophet (ﷺ). He used to turn to both his sides (sometimes to the left and sometimes to the right).
1042 | ‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) said; One of you should not give a share from his prayer to the devil, that he does not turn away expect to his right side. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) often turning away to his left side. the narrator ‘Umarah said:I came to medina afterwards and saw that the houses of the prophet (ﷺ) were (built) in the left.
1043 | Ibn ‘Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Offer some of your prayers in your houses, and do not make them graves.
1044 | Narrated Zayd ibn Thabit:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The prayer a man offers in his house is more excellent than his prayer in this mosque of mine except obligatory prayer.
1045 | Anas said:The Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions used to pray in the direction of Jerusalem. When the following verse was revealed: “ So turn thy face towards the inviolable mosque”; and Ye (O Muslims), wheresoever ye may be, turn your face towards it”(ii. 144), a man passed by the people of Banu Salamah. He called them while they were bowing in the morning prayer facing Jerusalem: Lo, the qiblah (direction of prayer) has been changed towards the ka’bah. He called them twice. So they turned their faces towards the Ka’bah while they were bowing.
1046 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The best day on which the sun has risen is Friday; on it Adam was created, on it he was expelled (from Paradise), on it his contrition was accepted, on it he died, and on it the Last Hour will take place. On Friday every beast is on the lookout from dawn to sunrise in fear of the Last Hour, but not jinn and men, and it contains a time at which no Muslim prays and asks anything from Allah but He will give it to him.  Ka'b said: That is one day every year.  So I said: It is on every Friday.  Ka'b read the Torah and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has spoken the truth.  AbuHurayrah said: I met Abdullah ibn Salam and told him of my meeting with Ka'b.  Abdullah ibn Salam said: I know what time it is.  AbuHurayrah said: I asked him to tell me about it. Abdullah ibn Salam said: It is at the very end of Friday.  I asked: How can it be when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has said: "No Muslim finds it while he is praying...." and this is the moment when no prayer is offered.  Abdullah ibn Salam said: Has the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) not said: "If anyone is seated waiting for the prayer, he is engaged in the prayer until he observes it."  I said: Yes, it is so.
1047 | Narrated Aws ibn Aws:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Among the most excellent of your days is Friday; on it Adam was created, on it he died, on it the last trumpet will be blown, and on it the shout will be made, so invoke more blessings on me that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.  The people asked: Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of Prophets.
1048 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Friday is divided into twelve hours. Amongst them there is an hour in which a Muslim does not ask Allah  for anything but He gives it to him. So seek it in the last hour after the afternoon prayer.
1049 | Abu Burdah b. Abl Musa al-Asha’ri said:‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar said to me: Did you hear your father narrating a tradition from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about an hour on Friday (when supplication is accepted by Allah)? I said: Yes, I heard it. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: This hour is found during the period when the imam is seated (for giving Friday sermon) until the prayer is finished.   Abu Dawud said: By sitting is meant sitting on the pulpit.
1050 | If anyone performs ablution, doing it well, then come to the Friday prayer, listens and keeps silence, his sins between that time and the next Friday will be forgiven, with three days extra; but he who touches pebbles has caused an interruption.
1051 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      Ali said on the pulpit in the mosque of Kufah: When Friday comes, the devils go to the markets with their flags, and involve people in their needs and prevent them from the Friday prayer. The angels come early in the morning, sit at the door of the mosque, and record that so-and-so came at the first hour, and so-and-so came at the second hour until the imam comes out (for preaching).        When a man sits in a place where he can listen (to the sermon) and look (at the imam), where he remains silent and does not interrupt, he will receive a double reward. If he stays away, sits in a place where he cannot listen (to the sermon), silent, and does not interrupt, he will receive the reward only once. If he sits in a place where he can listen (to the sermon) and look (at the imam), and he does not remain silent, he will have the burden of it. If anyone says to his companion sitting besides him to be silent (while the imam is preaching), he is guilty of idle talk. Anyone who interrupts (during the sermon) will receive nothing (no reward) on that Friday.        Then he (the narrator) says in the end of this tradition: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say so.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by al-Walid b. Muslim from Ibn Jabir. This version adds: bi'l-raba'ith (instead of al-raba'ith, needs preventing the people from prayer). Further, this adds: Freed slave of his wife Umm 'Uthman b. 'Ata.
1052 | Narrated Al-Ja'd ad-Damri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who leaves the Friday prayer (continuously) for three Friday on account of slackness, Allah will print a stamp on his heart.
1053 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone omits the Friday prayer without excuse, he must give a dinar in alms, or if he does not have as much, then half a dinar.   Abu Dawud said: Khalid b. Qais reported this tradition in this manner, but he disagreed in respect of chain (of transmitters) and agreed in respect of the text.
1054 | Narrated Qudamah ibn Wabirah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone omits the Friday prayer without excuse, he must give one dirham or half a dirham, or one sa' or half a sa' of wheat, in alms.    Abu Dawud said: Sa'id b. Bashir reported this tradition in a like manner, except that he narrated "one mudd or half mudd" (instead of sa'). He narrated it from Samurah.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal being asked about the differences over the narration of this Hadith. He said: "Hammam has a stronger memory - in my opinion - than Ayyub."
1055 | ‘A’ishah, the wife of prophet(ﷺ), said:The people used to attend the Friday prayer from their houses and from the suburbs of Medina.
1056 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The Friday prayer is obligatory on him who hears the call.     Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by a group of narrators from Sufyan. They did not narrate it as a statement of the Prophet (ﷺ); only Qabisah has transmitted it as saying of the Prophet (ﷺ).
1057 | Narrated Usamah ibn Umayr al-Huzali:      The rain was falling on the day when the Battle of Hunayn took place. The Prophet (ﷺ), therefore, commanded that the people should offer their prayer in their camps.
1058 | Abu al-Malih said:That took place on a Friday.
1059 | Narrated Usamah ibn Umayr al-Huzali:      Usamah attended the Prophet (ﷺ) on the occasion of the treaty of al-Hudaybiyyah on Friday. The rain fell as little as the soles of the shoes of the people were not set. He (the Prophet) commanded them to offer Friday prayer in their dwellings.
1060 | Nafi said:Ibn ‘Umar stayed at Dajnan (a place between Mecca and Medina) on a cold night. He commanded an announcer (to announce). He announced that the people should offer prayer in their dwellings. Ayyub said: Nafi narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar that whenever there  was a cold or a rainy day night, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded the announcer (to announce). He announced to offer prayer in the dwellings.
1061 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Nafi' reported: Ibn Umar made the call to prayer at Dajnan (a place between Mecca and Medina). Then he announced: "Offer prayer in your dwellings:" He then narrated a tradition from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He used to command an announcer who made the call to prayer. He then announced: "Pray in your dwellings" on a cold or rainy night during journey.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Hammad b. Salamah from Ayyub and 'Ubaid Allah. In his version he added: During journey on a cold or a rainy night.
1062 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Nafi' said: Ibn Umar made the call to prayer at Dajnan (a place between Mecca and Medina), on a cold and windy night. He added the words at the end of the call: "Lo! pray in your dwellings. Lo! pray in the dwellings."  He then said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to command the mu'adhdhin to announce, "Lo! pray in your dwellings." on a cold or rainy night during journey.
1063 | Nafi said:Ibn ‘Umar made the call to prayer on a cold and windy night. He then said: “Lo! Pray in the dwellings. “Afterwards he said: Whenever there was a cold or rainy day night, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to command the mu’adhdin to announce:  “Lo! Pray in the dwellings.”
1064 | Ibn ‘Umar said:The announcer of the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) announced for that (to pray at homes) at Medina on a rainy night or a cold morning.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been narrated by Yahya b. Sa’id al-Ansari from al-Qasim from Ibn ‘Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ). This version adds the words “During the journey.”
1065 | Jabir said:We were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during a journey. The rain fell upon us.  The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Anyone who wants to pray in his dwelling may pray.
1066 | Ibn Sirin said:Ibn ‘Abbas said to his mu’adhdhin on a rainy day: “when you utter the words ‘ I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,” do not say,” Come to prayer” but say “Pray at your homes,” By this (announcement) the people were surprised. He said: One who was better than me has done it. The Friday prayer is an obligatory duty. But I disliked to put you to hardship so that you might walk in mud and rain.
1067 | Narrated Tariq ibn Shihab:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The Friday prayer in congregation is a necessary duty for every Muslim, with four exceptions; a slave, a woman, a boy, and a sick person.     Abu Dawud said: Tariq b. Shihab had seen the Prophet (ﷺ) but not heard anything from him.
1068 | Ibn ‘Abbas said:The Friday prayer first offered in Islam after the Friday prayer offered in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is Friday prayer offered at Juwatha, a village from the villages of al-Bahrain. The narrator ‘Uthman said: it is a village from the village of the tribe of ‘Abd al-Qais.
1069 | Narrated Ka'b ibn Malik:      AbdurRahman ibn Ka'b ibn Malik said: When Ka'b ibn Malik heard the call to prayer on Friday, he prayed for As'ad ibn Zurarah. I asked him: What is the matter that when you hear the call to prayer, you pray for As'ad ibn Zurarah? He replied: This is because he held the Friday prayer for the first time for us at Hazm an-Nabit of Harrah belonging to Banu Bayadah in Naqi', called Naqi' al-Khadumat. I asked him: How many were you at that time ? He said: Forty.
1070 | Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam:      Ilyas ibn AbuRamlah ash-Shami said: I witnessed Mu'awiyah ibn AbuSufyan asking Zayd ibn Arqam: Did you offer along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) the Friday and 'Id prayers synchronised on the same day? He said: Yes. He asked: How did he do? He replied: He offered the 'Id prayer, then granted concession to offer the Friday prayer, and said: If anyone wants to offer it, he may offer.
1071 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Ata' ibn AbuRabah said: Ibn az-Zubayr led us in the 'Id prayer on Friday early in the morning. When we went to offer the Friday, he did not come out to us. So we prayed ourselves alone. At that time Ibn Abbas was present in at-Ta'if. When he came to us, we mentioned this (incident) to him. He said: He followed the sunnah.
1072 | ‘Ata’ said:The Friday and the ‘id prayers synchronized during the time of Ibn al-Zubair. He said: Two festivals (‘id and Friday) synchronized on the same day. He combined them and offered two rak’ahs in the morning and did not add anything to them until he offered the afternoon prayer.
1073 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Two festivals ('Id and Friday) have synchronised on this day. If anyone does not want to offer the Friday prayer, the 'Id prayer is sufficient for him. But we shall offer the Friday prayer.     This tradition has been narrated by 'Umar from Shu'bah.
1074 | Ibn ‘Abbas said:the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite in the morning prayer on Friday Surah Tanzil al-Sajdah (xxxii.) and Surah al-Dahr(lxxi.).

1076 | ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar said:‘Umar b. al-Khattab saw a silken suit sold at the gate of the mosque. He said: Messenger of Allah, would that you purchase this suit and wear it on Friday and on the occasion when a delegation (from the outside) comes to you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: One who has no share in the afterlife will put on this (suit). Afterwards suits of similar nature were brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He gave ‘Umar b. al-Khattab one of these suits. ‘Umar said: Messenger of Allah, you are giving it to me for use while you had told me such-and-such about the suit of ‘Utarid (I.e. sold by ‘Utarid). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I did not give it to you that you should wear it. Hence ‘Umar gave it to his brother who was a disbeliever at Mecca for wearing.
1077 | 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar said:'Umar b. al-Khattab saw a suit of silken cloth being sold in the market. He took it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and said: Purchase it ad decorate with it on 'id on the occasion of the arrival of delegations. The narrator then narrated the tradition. The former version is complete.
1078 | Narrated Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Habban:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What is the harm if any of you has two garments, if he can provide them, for Friday (prayer) in addition to the two garments for his daily work? Amr reported from Ibn Habib from Musa ibn Sa'd from Ibn Habban from Ibn Salam who heard this (tradition) from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the pulpit.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been reported by Yusuf b. 'Abd Allah b. Salam from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators.
1079 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited buying and selling in the mosque, announcing aloud about a lost thing, the recitation of a poem in it, and prohibited sitting in a circle (in the mosque) on Friday before the prayer.
1080 | Abu Hazim b. Dinar said:People came to Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idi, when they were doubtful about the kind of wood of the pulpit (in the mosque of the Prophet). They asked him about it. He said: By Allah, I know (the wood) of which it was made; I saw it the first day when it was placed there, and the first day when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat on it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent for a woman whom Sahl named and asked her: Order your boy, the carpenter, to construct for me a wooden pulpit so that I sit on it when I deliver a speech to the people. So she ordered him and he made a pulpit of a wood called tarfa taken from al-Ghabah (a place at a distance of nine miles from Medina). He brought it to her. She sent it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He ordered and that was placed here. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) praying on it: he said: "Allah is most great"; he then bowed while he was on it; then he returned and prostrated in the root of the pulpit; he then returned (to the pulpit). When he finished (the prayer), he addressed himself to the people and said: O people, I did this so that you may follow me and know my prayer.
1081 | Ibn 'Umar said:When the Prophet (ﷺ) became fat, Tamim al-Dari said to him: Should I make for you pulpit, Messenger of Allah, that will bear the burden of your body ? He said: Yes. So he made a pulpit consisting of two steps.

Mujahid is older than Abu al-Khalil, and Abu al-Khalil did not hear (any tradition from) Abu Qatadah.

1087 | Al-Sa'ib b. Yazid said:During the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr and 'Umar the call to the Friday prayer was first made at the time when the imam was seated on the pulpit (for giving the sermon).

The rule of action continued to the same effect.
1088 | Sa'id b. Yazid said:The call to the (Friday) prayer was made at the gate of the mosque in front of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he sat on the pulpit, and of Abu Bakr and 'Umar. The narrator then repeated the same tradition as reported by Yunus.
1089 | Sa'ib said:There was no other mu'adhdhin (pronouncer) of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) except Bilal.   The narrator then reported the tradition to the same effect.
1090 | Sa'ib said:There was no other mu'adhdhin of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He then narrated the tradition which is incomplete.

Abu Dawud said: This tradition is known as mursal (the successor reports directly from the Prophet, omitting then name of the Companion). The people narrated it from the Prophet (ﷺ) on the authority of 'Ata'. Makhlad is his teacher.
1092 | Ibn 'Umar said:The Prophet (ﷺ) used to deliver two sermons. He would sit down when he ascended the pulpit till he (I think he meant the mu'adhdhin) finished. He would then stand up and preach, then sit down and say nothing, then stand up and preach.
1093 | Jabir b. Samurah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to deliver the sermon standing, then he would sit down, then stand and preach standing. If anyone tells you he preached sitting, he is lying. I swear by Allah that I offered along with more than two thousand prayers.

1095 | Jabir b. Samurah said:I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) would deliver the sermon standing, then sit down without saying anything. The narrator then reported the tradition in full.
1096 | Shu'ayb ibn Zurayq at-Ta'ifi said:I sat with a man who had been in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He was called al-Hakam ibn Hazn al-Kulafi. He began to narrate a tradition to us saying: I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a delegation consisting of seven or nine persons. We entered upon him and said: Messenger of Allah, we have visited you, so pray Allah what is good for us. He ordered to give us some dates. The Muslims in those days were weak. We stayed there for several days and offered the Friday prayer along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He stood leaning on a staff or a bow. He praised Allah and exalted Him in light, pure and blessed words. Then he said: O people, you have no power to obey or you cannot obey what you are ordered. But be straight and give good tidings.    Abu 'Ali said: Did you hear Abu Dawud ? He said: Some of my companions reminded me of some words that were omitted from writing on the paper.
1097 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed, he would say: Praise be to Allah, from Whom we seek help and pardon,and we seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our souls. He whom Allah guide has no one who can lead him astray, and he whom He leads astray has no one to guide him. And I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and apostle. He sent him before the coming of the last hour with truth giving good tidings and warning. He who obeys Allah and His Apostle follows the right path; and he who disobeys them shall harm none except himself, and he will not harm Allah in the least.
1098 | Narrated Ibn Shihab:      Yunus asked Ibn Shihab about the address of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on Friday. He mentioned it in like manner.

1099 | 'Adi b. Hatim said:A speaker delivered a speech in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: Anyone who obeys Allah and His Apostle, and one who disobeys them. He said: Go away, you are a bad speaker.
1100 | Bint al-Harith b. al-Nu'man said:I memorized Surah al-Qaf from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); he would recite it in his speech on every friday. Our oven and his oven were same.   Abu Dawud said: Rawh b. 'Ubadah reported on the authority of Shu'bah the name Bint Harithah b. al-Nu'man ; and Ibn Ishaq reported the name of Umm Hisham hint Harithah b. al-Nu'man.
1101 | Jabir b. Samurah said:The prayer offered by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was moderate, and the sermon given by him was (also) moderate. He would recite a few verses from the Qur'an and exhort the people.
1102 | 'Umrah reported on the authority of her sister:I memorized Surah al-Qaf from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); he used to recite it on every friday.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated in a similar way by Yahya b. Ayyub, Ibn Abu Ar-Rijal, from Yahya b. Sa'id, from 'Umrah from Umm Hisham hint Harithah b. al-Nu'man.
1103 | This tradition has also been transmitted to the same effect through a different chain of narrators by 'Umrah from her sister 'Umrah daughter of 'Abd al-Rahman who was older than her.
1104 | 'Umarah b. Ruwaibah said that he saw Bishr b. Marwan (on the pulpit) praying on Friday (by raising his hands). 'Umarah said:May Allah reject these hands! I have seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the pulpit gesturing no more than this pointing with his forefinger.
1105 | Narrated Sahl ibn Sa'd:      I never saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raising his hands and praying on the pulpit or otherwise. But I saw him saying (doing) this way, and he would point with his forefinger making a circle by joining the middle finger with his thumb.
1106 | Narrated Ammar ibn Yasir:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to shorten the speeches.
1107 | Narrated Jabir ibn Samurah as-Suwa'i:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would not lengthen the sermon on Friday. He would say a few words.
1108 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Attend the sermon (on Friday) and sit near the imam, for a man keeps himself away until he will be left behind at the time of entering Paradise though he enters it.
1109 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) delivered a speech to us; meanwhile al-Hasan and al-Husayn came upon there stumbling, wearing red shirts. He came down from the pulpit, took them and ascended it with them. He then said: Allah truly said: "Your property and your children are only trial" (Ixiv.15). I saw both of them, and I could not wait. Afterwards he resumed the speech.
1110 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited to sit on hips by erecting feet, sticking them to the stomach and holding them with hands on Friday while the imam is delivering the sermon.
1111 | Ya'la b. Shaddad b. Aws said:I came to Mu'awiyah in Jerusalem. He led us in the Friday prayer. I saw that most of the people in the mosque were the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ). I saw them sitting in ihtiba condition, i.e. sitting on hips erecting the feet and sticking them to the stomach and holding them with hands or tying them with a cloth to the back, while the imam was giving sermon.   Abu Dawud said: Ibn 'Umar used to sit in ihtiba position while the imam gave the Friday sermon. Anas b. Malik, Shuraih, Sa'sa'ah b. Sawhan, Sa'id b. al-Musayyib, Ibrahim al-Nakha'i, Makhul, Isma'il, Ismail b. Muhammad b. Sa'd, and Nu'aim b. Sulamah said: There is no harm in sitting in ihtiba position.

1112 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:When you tell (your brother on Friday) to be silent while the imam is giving the sermon you are guilty of idle talk.
1113 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Three types of people attend Friday prayer; One is present in a frivolous way and that is all he gets from it; another comes with a supplication, Allah may grant or refuse his request as He wishes; another is present silently and quietly with-out stepping over a Muslim or annoying anyone, and that is an atonement for his sins till the next Friday and three days more, the reason being that Allah, the Exalted, says: "He who does a good deed will have ten times as much" (vi.160).
1114 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When one of you becomes defiled during prayer, he should hold his nose and then turn away.     Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Hammad b. Salamah and Abu Usamah from Hisham on the authority of his father from the Prophet (Saws). They did not mention the name of 'Aishah.

1120 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      I saw the Apostle (ﷺ) would descend from the pulpit and a man stop him for his need. He would remain standing with him until his need was fulfilled. Then he would stand and  pray.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition is not well known from the narrator Thabit. Jarir b. Hazim is the only narrator of this tradition.

1123 | Al-Dahhak b. Qais asked al-Nu'man b. Bashir:What did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited on Friday after reciting the Surah al-Jumu'ah (62). He replied: He used to recite, "Had the story of overwhelming event reached you ?" (88).
1124 | Ibn Abi Rafi' said:Abu Hurairah led us in the Friday prayer and recited Surah al-Jumu'ah and "When the hypocrites come to you" (63) in  the last rak'ah.

Abu Hurairah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) reciting them on Friday.
1125 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite in the Friday prayer: "Glorify the name of your most high Lord" (Surah 87) and Has the story of the overwhelming event reached you? (Surah 88).

He said:I offered the Friday prayer along with him in enclosure. When I uttered the salutation I stood up in my place and prayed. When he went in, he sent me a message saying: Never again do what you have done. When you pray the Friday prayer, you must not join another prayer to it till you have engaged in conversation or gone out, for the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) gave the precise command not to join on prayer till you have engaged in conversation or gone out.
1130 | 'Ata said:When Ibn 'Umar offered the Friday prayer in Mecca he would go forward and pray two rak'ahs, he would then go forward and pray four rak'ahs; but when he was in Medina, he offered the Friday prayer, then returned to his house and prayed two rak'ahs, not praying them in the mosque. Someone mentioned this to him and he replied that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do it.
1131 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying (this is the  version of the narrator Ibn al-Sabbah):If anyone of you prays after the Friday prayer, he should say for rak'ahs. According to the version of the narrator Ibn Yunus, the tradition goes: When you have offered the Friday prayer, pray after it four rak'ahs. He said: My father said to me: My son, if you have said two rak'ahs in the mosque, then you comes to your house, pray two rak'ahs more.
1132 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray two rak'ahs in his house after the Friday prayer.     Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted in a similar way by 'Abd Allah b. Dinar from Ibn 'Umar.
1133 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Ibn Jurayj said: Ata' told me that he saw Ibn Umar pray after the Friday prayer. He moved a little from the place where he offered the Friday prayer. Then he would pray two rak'ahs. He then walked far away from that place and would offer four rak'ahs. I asked Ata': How many times did you see Ibn Umar do that? He replied: Many times. AbuDawud said: This has been narrated by AbdulMalik ibn AbuSulayman, but did not narrate it completely.
1134 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to Medina, the people had two days on which they engaged in games. He asked: What are these two days (what is the significance)? They said: We used to engage ourselves on them in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah has substituted for them something better than them, the day of sacrifice and the day of the breaking of the fast.
1135 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Busr:      Yazid ibn Khumayr ar-Rahbi said: Abdullah ibn Busr, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out along with the people on the day of the breaking of the fast or on the day of sacrifice (to offer the prayer). He disliked the delay of the imam, and said: We would finish (our 'Id prayer) at this moment, that is, at the time of forenoon.
1136 | Umm 'Atiyyah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to bring out the secluded women on the day of 'Id (festival). He was asked: What about the menstruous women ? He said: They should be present at the place of virtue and the supplications of the Muslims. A woman said: Messenger of Allah, what should we do it one of us does not possess an outer garment ? He replied: Let her friend lend a part of her garment.
1137 | This tradition has also been narrated by Umm 'Atiyyah in a similar manner through a different chain. She added:The menstruating women should keep themselves away from the place of prayer of the Muslims. She did not mention the garment. She narrated this tradition from Hafsah mentioning a woman who asked about another woman saying: O Messenger of Allah ....She then reported the tradition like that narrated by Musa mentioning the garment.
1138 | This tradition has also been narrated by Umm 'Atiyyah though a different chain of transmitters. She said:We were commanded to go out (for offering the 'Id prayer). She further said: The menstruating women stood behind the people and they uttered the takbir (Allah is most great) along with the people.
1139 | Umm 'Atiyyah said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to Medina, he gathered the women of Ansar in a house, and sent to us (to them) 'Umar b. al-Khattab. He stood at the door and gave the salutation to us and we returned it (the salutation) to him. Thereupon, he said: I am the messenger of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to you. He commanded us to bring out the menstruating women and the virgins for both the 'Id prayers, and that the Friday prayer is not obligatory on us. He prohibited us to accompany the funeral procession.
1140 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said:Marwan brought out the pulpit on 'Id. He began preaching before the prayer. A man stood and said: You opposed the sunnah, O Marwan. You brought out the pulpit on the 'Id, it was not brought out before: and you began preaching before the prayer. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: Wh is this (man) ? They (people) said: So-and so son of so-and-so. He has performed his duty. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: He who observes and evil deed should change it with his hand if he can do so; if he cannot do, (he should change it) then with his tongue; if he cannot do then (he should change it) with his heart, and that is the weakest degree of the faith.
1141 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) stood on the day of the breaking of the fast ('Id) and offered prayer. He began the prayer before the sermon.  He then addressed the people. When the Prophet (ﷺ) finished the sermon, he descended (from the pulpit) and went to women. He gave them an exhortation while he was leaning on the hand of Bilal. Bilal was spreading his garment in which women were putting alms; some women put their rings and others other things.
1142 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out on 'Id (the festival day). He first offered the prayer and then delivered the sermon . He then went to women, taking Bilal with him. The narrator Ibn Kathir said: The probable opinion of Shu'bah is that he commanded them to give alms. So they began to put (their jewellery).
1143 | The above mentioned tradition has also been narrated by Ibn 'Abbas to the same effect through a different chain of transmitters. This version adds:He (the Prophet) thought that women could not hear (his sermon). So he went to them and Bilal was in his company. He gave them exhortation and commanded them to give alms. Some women put their ear-rings and other their rings in the garment of Bilal.
1144 | The above mentioned tradition has also bee transmitted by Ibn 'Abbas through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:The women began to give their ear-rings and rings in alms. Bilal began to collect them in his garment. He (the Prophet) then distributed them among the poor Muslims.
1145 | Al-Bara' said:Someone presented a bow to the Prophet (ﷺ) on the 'Id (festival). So he preached leaning on it.
1146 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Abis said:A man asked Ibb 'Abbas: Have you been present along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ? He replied: Yes. Had there been no dignity for me in his eyes, I would not have been present with him due to my minority. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to the point that was near the house of Kathir b. al-Salt. He prayed and afterwards preached. He (Ibn 'Abbas) did not mention the adhan (call to prayer) and the iqamah. He then commanded to give alms. The women began to point to their ears and throats (to give their jewelry in alms).
1147 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered the 'Id prayer without the adhan and the iqamah. AbuBakr and Umar or Uthman also did so. The narrator Yahya is doubtful about Uthman.
1148 | Jabir b. Samurah said:I prayed the 'Id prayer with the Prophet (ﷺ) not once or twice (but many times) without the adhan and the iqamah.
1149 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would say the takbir (Allah is most great) seven times  in the first rak'ah and five times in the second rak'ah on the day of the breaking of the fast and on the day of sacrifice (on the occasion of both the 'Id prayers, the two festivals).
1150 | The above mentioned tradition has also been narrated by Ibn Shihab through a different chain of transmitters to the same effect. This version adds:"Except the two takers pronounced at the time of the bowing."
1151 | 'Abd b. 'Amr b. al-'As said:The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) said: There are seven takers in the first rak'ah and five in the second rak'ah of the prayer offered on the day of the breaking of the fast.
1152 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to say on the day of the breaking of the fast seven takbirs in the first rak'ah and then recite the Qur'an, and utter the takbir (Allah is most great). Then he would stand, and utter the takbir four times. Thereafter he would recite the Qur'an and bow.    Abu Dawud said: This has been narrated by Waki' and Ibn al-Mubarak. Their version goes: "Seven (in the first rak'ah) and five (in the second)."
1153 | Abu 'Aishah said:Sa'id b. al-'As asked Abu Musa al-Ash'ari and Hudhaifah b. al-Yaman: How would the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) utter the takbir (Allah is most great) in the prayer of the day of sacrifice and of the breaking of the fast. Abu Musa said: He uttered takbir four times as he did at funerals. Hudhaifah said: He is correct. Then Abu Musa said: I used to utter the takbir in a similar way when I was the governor of Basrah. Abu 'Aishah said: I was present there when Sa'id b. al-'As asked.
1154 | 'Ubaid Allah b. 'Abd Allah b. 'Utbah b. Mas'ud said:'Umar b. al-Khattab asked Abu Waqid al-Laithi: What did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recite during the prayer on the day of sacrifice and on the breaking of the fast ? He replied: He recited at both of them Surah al-Qaf, "By the Glorious Quran" [50] and the Surah "The Hour is nigh" (54).
1155 | Narrated Abdullah ibn as-Sa'ib:      I attended the 'Id prayer along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When he finished the prayer, he said: We shall deliver the sermon; he who likes to sit for listening to it may sit and he who likes to go away may go away.     Abu Dawud said: this is a mursal tradition (i.e. the successor 'Ata directly reporting from the Prophet (ﷺ) and omitting the link of the Companions).
1156 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out by one road on the day of the 'Id (festival) and returned by another.
1157 | Narrated AbuUmayr ibn Anas:      AbuUmayr reported on the authority of some of his paternal uncles who were Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ): Some men came riding to the Prophet (ﷺ) and testified that they had sighted the new moon the previous day. He (the Holy Prophet), therefore, commanded the people to break the fast and to go out to their place of prayer in the morning.
1158 | Narrated Bakr ibn Mubashshir al-Ansari:      I used to go to the place of prayer on the day of the breaking of the fast, and on the day of sacrifice along with the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We would walk through a valley known as Batn Bathan till we came to the place of prayer. Then we would pray along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and return through Batn Bathan to our house.
1159 | Ibn 'Abbas said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out on the day of the breaking of the fast and prayed two rak'ahs, before and after which he did not pray.

1161 | Abbad b. Tamim (al-Muzini) reported on the authority of his uncle:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took the people out (to the place of prayer) and prayed for rain.  He led them in two rak'ahs of prayer in the course of which he recited from the Qur'an in a loud voice.  He turned around his cloak and raised his hands, prayed for rain and faced the qiblah
1162 | Abbad b. Tamim al Mazini said on the authority of his uncle (Abd Allah b. Zaid b Asim) who was a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ):One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to make supplication for rain.  He turned his back towards the people praying to Allah, the Exalted.  The narrator Sulaiman b. Dawud said: He faced the qiblah and turned around his cloak and then offered two rak'ahs of prayer.  The narrator Ibn Abi Dhi'b said: He recited from the Qur'an in both of them.  The version of Ibn al-Sarh adds: By it he means in a loud voice.
1163 | The above-mentioned tradition has also been transmitted by Muhammad b. Muslim through a different chain of narrators.  But there is no mention of prayer in this version. The version adds:"He turned around his cloak, putting its right side on his left shoulder and its left side on his right shoulder.  Thereafter he made supplication to Allah."
1164 | Abd Allah b. Zaid said:The Messenger of Allah (pbuh)prayed for rain wearing a black robe with ornamented border.  The Messenger of Allah (pbuh)wanted to reverse it from bottom to top by holding the bottom.  But when it was too heavy he turned it round on his shoulders.
1165 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Ishaq ibn Abdullah ibn Kinanah reported: Al-Walid ibn Utbah or (according to the version of Uthman) al-Walid ibn Uqbah, the then governor of Medina, sent me to Ibn Abbas to ask him about the prayer for rain offered by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out wearing old clothes in a humble and lowly manner until he reached the place of prayer. He then ascended the pulpit, but he did not deliver the sermon as you deliver (usually).  He remained engaged in making supplication, showing humbleness (to Allah) and uttering the takbir (Allah is most great). He then offered two rak'ahs of prayer as done on the 'Id (festival).   Abu Dawud said: This is the version of al-Nufail. What is correct is Ibn Utbah's
1166 | Abd Allah b. Zaid said:The Messenger of Allah (pbuh)went out to the place of prayer to pray for rain.  When he wanted to make supplication, he faced the qiblah and turned around his cloak.
1167 | Narrated Abd Allah b. Zaid al Mazini:Abd Allah b. Zaid al Mazini said: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) went out to the place of prayer and made supplication or rain, and turned around his cloak when the faced the qiblah.
1168 | Narrated Umayr, the client of AbulLahm:      Umayr saw the Prophet (ﷺ) praying for rain at Ahjar az-Zayt near az-Zawra', standing, making supplication, praying for rain and raising his hands in front of his face, but not lifting them above his head.
1169 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The people came to the Prophet (ﷺ) weeping (due to drought). He said (making supplication): O Allah! give us rain which will replenish us, abundant, fertilising and profitable, not injurious, granting it now without delay. He (the narrator) said: Thereupon the sky became overcast.
1170 | Narrated Anas:The Prophet (peace be upon him) was not accustomed to raise his hands in any supplication he made except when praying for rain.  He would then raise them high enough so much so that the whiteness of his armpits was visible.
1171 | Narrated Anas:The Prophet (ﷺ) used to make supplication for rain in this manner.  he spread his hands keeping the inner side (of hands) towards the earth, so I witnessed the whiteness of his armpits.
1172 | Narrated Muhammad b. Ibrahim:A man who witnessed the Prophet (ﷺ)  reported to me that he saw the Prophet (ﷺ) praying at Ahjar al-Zait spreading his hands.
1173 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The people complained to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) of the lack of rain, so he gave an order for a pulpit. It was then set up for him in the place of prayer. He fixed a day for the people on which they should come out.        Aisha said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), when the rim of the sun appeared, sat down on the pulpit, and having pronounced the greatness of Allah and expressed His praise, he said: You have complained of drought in your homes, and of the delay in receiving rain at the beginning of its season. Allah has ordered you to supplicate Him has and promised that He will answer your prayer.        Then he said: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the Master of the Day of Judgment. There is no god but Allah Who does what He wishes. O Allah, Thou art Allah, there is no deity but Thou, the Rich, while we are the poor. Send down the rain upon us and make what Thou sendest down a strength and satisfaction for a time.        He then raised his hands, and kept raising them till the whiteness under his armpits was visible. He then turned his back to the people and inverted or turned round his cloak while keeping his hands aloft. He then faced the people, descended and prayed two rak'ahs.        Allah then produced a cloud, and the storm of thunder and lightning came on. Then the rain fell by Allah's permission, and before he reached his mosque streams were flowing. When he saw the speed with which the people were seeking shelter, he (ﷺ) laughed till his back teeth were visible.        Then he said: I testify that Allah is Omnipotent and that I am Allah's servant and apostle.   Abu Dawud said: This is a ghraib (rate) tradition, but its chain is sound. The people of Medina recite "maliki" (instead of maaliki) yawm al-din" (the master of the Day of Judgement). But this tradition (in which the word maalik occurs) is an evidence for them.
1174 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The people of Medina had a drought during the time of the Prophet (ﷺ).        While he was preaching on a Friday, a man stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, the horses have perished, the goats have perished, pray to Allah to give us water. He spread his hands and prayed.        Anas said: The sky was like a mirror (there was no cloud). Then the wind rose; a cloud appeared (in the sky) and it spread : the sky poured down the water. We came out (from the mosque after the prayer) passing through the water till we reached our homes. The rain continued till the following Friday. The same or some other person stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, the houses have been demolished, pray to Allah to stop it.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled and said: (O Allah), the rain may fall around us but not upon us. Then I looked at the cloud which dispersed around Medina just like a crown.
1175 | Narrated The above mentioned tradition has been narrated by Anas through a different chain of transmitters:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his hands in front of his face and said: O Allah! Give us water.  the narrator then reported then reported the tradition like the former.
1176 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, quoted his grandfather as saying: When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for rain, he said: O Allah! Provide water for Your servants and Your cattle, display Your mercy and give life to Your dead land.   This is the wording of Malik.
1177 | Narrated A'ishah (May Allah be pleased with her):There was an eclipse of the sun in the time of the Prophet (ﷺ).  The Prophet stood for a long time, accompanied by the people.  He then bowed, then raised his head, then he bowed and then he raised his head, and again he bowed and prayed two rak'ahs of prayer.  In each rak'ah he bowed three times.  After bowing for the third time he prostrated himself.  He stood for such a long time that some people became unconscious on that occasion and buckets of water had to be poured on them.  When he bowed, he said, Allah is most great; and when he raised his head, he said, Allah listens to him who praises Him, till the sun became bright.  then he said: The sun and the moon are not eclipsed on account of anyone's death or on account of anyone's birth, but they are two of Allah's signs, He produces dread in His servants by means of them.  When they are eclipsed, hasten to prayer
1178 | Narrated Jabir b. Abd Allah:There was an eclipse of the sun in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had died.  The people began to to say that there was an eclipse on account of the death of Ibrahim.   The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and led the people in prayer performing six bowings and four prostrations.  he said: Allah is most great, and then recited from the Qur'an and prolonged the recitation.  He then bowed nearly as long as he stood.  He then raised his head and recited from the Qur'an but it was less than the first (recitation).  He then bowed nearly as long as he stood.  He then raised his head and then recited from the Quran for the third time, but it was less than the second recitation.  He then bowed nearly as long as he stood.  he then raised his head and then recited from the Qur'an for the third time, but it was less than the second recitation.  he then bowed nearly as long as he stood.  Then he raised his head and went down for prostration.  he made two prostrations.  He then stood and made three bowings before prostrating himself, the preceding bowing being more lengthy than the following, but he bowed nearly as long as he stood.  He then stepped back during the prayer and the rows (of the people) too stepped back along with him.  Then he stepped forward and stood in his place, and the rows too stepped forward.  he then finished the prayer and the sun had become bright.  He said: O people, the sun and the moon are two of Allah's signs; they are not eclipsed on account of a man's death.  So when you see anything of that nature, offer prayer until the sun becomes bright.  The narrator then narrated the rest of the tradition.
1179 | Narrated Jabir:There was an eclipse of the sun in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a hot day.

The sun had become bright before he departed.
1181 | Narrated Abd Allah b. 'Abbas:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed at the solar eclipse as reported in the tradition narrated by 'Urwah from Aishah from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that he offered two rak'ahs of prayer bowing twice in each rak'ah.

He recited one of the long surahs, bowing five times and prostrating himself twice.  He then stood up for the second rak'ah, recited one of the long surahs, bowed five times, prostrated himself twice, then sat where he was facing the qiblah and made the supplication till the eclipse was over.

It became black like the black herb called tannumah.        One of us said to his companion: Let us go to the mosque; by Allah, this incident of the sun will surely bring something new in the community of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        As we reached it, we suddenly saw that he (the Prophet) had already come out (of his house). He stepped forward for a long time as much as he could do so in the prayer. But we did not hear his voice. He then performed a bowing and prolonged it as much as he could do in the prayer. But we did not hear his voice. He then prostrated himself with us and prolonged it which he never did in the prayer before. But we did not hear his voice. He then did similarly in the second rak'ah. The sun became bright when he sat after the second rak'ah. Then he uttered the salutation. He then stood up, praised Allah, and extolled Him, and testified that there was no god but Allah and testified that he was His servant and apostle. Ahmad ibn Yunus then narrated the address of the Prophet (ﷺ).

He said: If I had offered the supererogatory prayer (while travelling), I would have completed prayer, my cousin. I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the journey, he did not pray more than two raka'at until his death. I also accompanied Abu Bakr, and he prayed two raka'at and nothing more until he died. I also accompanied 'Umar, and he prayed two raka'at and nothing more until he died.

Thereupon, the unbelievers said: We suffered from negligence; we became careless. We should have attacked them while they were praying. Thereupon the verse was revealed, relating to the shortening of the prayer (in time of danger) between the noon and afternoon (prayer).        When the time of the afternoon prayer came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood facing the qiblah, and the unbelievers were standing in front of him. The people stood in a row behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and there was another row behind this row. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bowed and all of them bowed. He then prostrated and also the row near him prostrated. The other people in the second row remained standing and stood guard over them. When they performed two prostrations and stood up, those who were behind them prostrated. The people in the front row near him then stepped backward taking the place of the people in the second row and the second row took the place of the first row.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then bowed and all of them bowed together. Then he and the row near him prostrated themselves. The other people in the second row remained standing and stood guard over them. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the row near him (i.e. the front row) were seated, the people in the second row behind them prostrated themselves. Then all of them were seated. (He (the Prophet) then uttered the salutation upon all of them. He prayed in his manner at Usfan as well as at the territory of Banu Sulaym.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Ayyub and Hisham from Abu al-Zubair on the authority of Jabir to the same effect from the Prophet (ﷺ). Similarly, this has been transmitted by Dawud b. Husain from 'Ikrimah, on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas. This has also been reported by 'Abd al-Malik, from 'Ata' from Jabir in like manner.

1237 | Narrated Sahl b. Abi Hathmah:The Prophet (ﷺ) prayed in time of danger and divided them (the people) behind him in two rows. He then led those who were near him in one rak'ah. Then he stood and remained standing till those who were in second row offered one rak'ah. Thereafter they came forward and those who were in front of them (in the first row) stepped backward. The Prophet (ﷺ) led them in one rak'ah of prayer. He sat down till those who were in the second row completed on rak'ah. He then uttered the salutation.
1238 | Narrated Salih b. Khawwat: On the authority of a person who offered the prayer in time of danger along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the battle of Dhat al-Riqa.

He led those who were with him in one rak'ah and remained standing (in his place) and they completed (the second rak'ah) by themselves. Then they turned away and arrayed before the enemy. Thereafter the other section came and he led them in the rak'ah which remained from his prayer. He then remained sitting (in his place) and they completed their one rak'ah by themselves. He then uttered the salutation along with them.   Malik said: I like the tradition reported by Yazid b. Ruman (i.e. the present tradition) more than (other versions) I heard.
1239 | Narrated Sahl b. Abi Hathmah al-Ansari: The prayer time of danger should be offered in the following way: The imam should stand (for prayer) and a section of the people should stand along with him. The other section should stand facing the enemy. The imam should perform bowing and prostrate himself along with those who are with him. He then should stand (after prostration) and, when he stands straight, he should remain standing. They (the people) should (in the meantime) complete their remaining rak'ah (i.e. the second one). They they should utter the salutation, and turn away while the imam should remain standing. They should go before the enemy. Thereafter those who did not pray should come forward and utter the takbir (Allah is most great) behind imam. He should bow and prostrate along with them and utter the salutation. Then they should stand and completed their remaining rak'ah, and utter the salutation.   Abu Dawud said: The tradition reported by Yahya b. Sa'id from al-Qasim is similar to the one transmitted by Yazid b. Ruman except that he differed with him in salutation. The tradition reported by 'Ubaid Allah is like the one reported by Yahya b. Sa'id, saying: He (the Prophet) remained standing.
1240 | Urwah ibn az-Zubayr reported that Marwan ibn al-Hakam asked AbuHurayrah:Did you pray in time of danger with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?        AbuHurayrah replied: Yes.  Marwan then asked: When?  AbuHurayrah said: On the occasion of the Battle of Najd. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up to offer the afternoon prayer. One section stood with him (to pray) and the other was standing before the enemy, and their backs were towards the qiblah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) uttered the takbir and all of them too uttered the takbir, i.e. those who were with him and those who were facing the enemy. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered one rak'ah and the section that was with him also prayed one rak'ah. He then prostrated himself and those who were with him also prostrated, while the other section was standing before the enemy.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then stood up and the section with him also stood up. They went and faced the enemy and the section that was previously facing the enemy stepped forward. They bowed and prostrated while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was standing in the same position. Then they stood up and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon) prayed another rak'ah and all of them bowed and prostrated along with him. After that the section that was standing before the enemy came forward and they bowed and prostrated, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained seated and also those who were with him. The salutation then followed. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) uttered the salutation and all of them uttered it together. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed two rak'ahs and each of the two sections prayed one rak'ah with him (and the other by themselves).
1241 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:      We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to Najd. When we reached Dhat ar-Riqa at Nakhl (or in a valley with palm trees) he met a group of the tribe of Ghatafan. The narrator then reported the tradition to the same effect, but his version is other than that of Haywah. He added to the words "when he bowed along with those who were with him and prostrated"  the words "when they stood up, they retraced their footsteps to the rows of their companions". He did not mention the words "their back was towards the qiblah".
1242 | Abu Dawud said:This tradition has been transmitted by 'Aishah through a different chain of narrators. She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) uttered the takbir and the section that was in the same row with him also uttered the takbir. He then bowed and they also bowed, and he prostrated and they also prostrated. Then he raised his head and they also raised (their heads). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then remained seated. They prostrated alone and stood up and retraced their footsteps and stood behind them.        Then the other section came; they stood up and uttered the takbir and bowed by themselves. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prostrated himself and they also prostrated with him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and they performed the second prostration by themselves. Then both the sections stood up and prayed with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He bowed and they also bowed, and then he prostrated himself and they also prostrated themselves. Then he returned and performed the second prostration and they also prostrated with him as quickly as possible, showing no slackness in quick prostration. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then uttered the salutation. After that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up. Thus everyone participated in the entire prayer.
1243 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led one section in one rak'ah of prayer and the other section was facing the enemy. Then they turned away and took the position of the other section. They (the other section) came and he (the Prophet) led them in the second rak'ah. He then uttered the salutation. Thereafter they stood up and completed the remaining rak'ah, they went away and the other section completed their remaining rak'ah.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Nafi' and Khalid b. Ma'dan from Ibn 'Umar in like manner from the Prophet (ﷺ). This has also been transmitted similarly by Masruq ad Yusuf b. Mihran on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas. This has been narrated by Yunus from al-Hasan from Abu Musa something similarly, saying that Abu Musa has done so.
1244 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in prayer in the time of danger. They (the people) stood in two rows. One row was behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the other faced the enemy. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led them in one rak'ah,and then the other section came and took their place; they went and faced the enemy. The Prophet (ﷺ) led them in one rak'ah and uttered the salutation. They stood up and prayed the second rak'ah by themselves and uttered the salutation and went away; they took the place of the other section facing the enemy.  They came back and took their place. They prayed one rak'ah by themselves and then uttered the salutation.
1245 | This tradition has been transmitted by Kushaif with a different chain of narrators and to the same effect. This version adds:The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) uttered takbir and both rows uttered takbir together.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by al-Thawri to the same effect on the authority of Khusaif. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Samurah also prayed in like manner. But the section which he (the Prophet) led in one rak'ah and then uttered the salutation and went and took the place of their companions. They came and prayed one rak'ah by themselves. Then they returned to their place and they prayed (one rak'ah) by themselves.   Abu Dawud said: Muslim b. Ibrahim reported from 'Abd al-Samad b. Habib on the authority of his father that they had fought a battle at Kabul along with 'Abd al-Rahman b. Samurah. He led us in prayer in time of danger.
1246 | Narrated Hudhayfah:      Tha'labah ibn Zahdam said: We accompanied Sa'd ibn al-'As at Tabaristan. He stood and said: Which of you prayed along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in time of danger? Hudhayfah said: I then he led one section in one rak'ah and the other section in one rak'ah. They did not pray the second rak'ah by themselves.    Abu Dawud: This tradition has been transmitted by 'Ubaid Allah b. 'Abd Allah and Mujahid on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas from the Prophet (ﷺ) in like manner. This has also been narrated by 'Abd Allah b. Shaqiq from Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ). Yazid al-Faqir and Abu Musa also narrated this tradition from Jabir from the Prophet (ﷺ). Some of the narrators said in the version narrated by Yazid al-Faqir that they completed their second rak'ah. This has also been narrated by Simak al-Hanafi on the authority of Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ) something similar. Zaid b. Thabit also narrated from the Prophet (ﷺ) in like manner. This version adds: The people prayed on rak'ah and the Prophet (ﷺ) prayed two rak'ahs.
1247 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:Allah, the Exalted, prescribed prayer for you, through the tongue of your Prophet (ﷺ), four rak'ahs while resident, two rak'ahs while travelling and one rak'ah in time of danger.
1248 | Narrated AbuBakrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the noon prayer in time of danger. Some of the people formed a row behind him and others arrayed themselves against the enemy. He led them in two rak'ahs and then he uttered the salutation. Then those who were with him went away and took the position of their companions before the enemy. Then they came and prayed behind him. He led them in two rak'ahs and uttered the salutation. Thus the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered four rak'ahs and his companions offered two rak'ahs.       Al-Hasan used to give legal verdict on the authority of this tradition.   Abu Dawud said: This will be so in the sunset prayer. The imam will offer six rak'ahs and the people three rak'ahs.   Abu Dawud said: Yahya b. Abi Kathir narrated from Abu Salamah from Jabir from the Prophet (ﷺ) something similar. Sulaiman al-Yashkuri reported it from the Prophet (ﷺ) in like manner.
1249 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. Unais:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent me to Khalid b. Sufyan al-Hudhail. This was towards 'Uranah and 'Arafat. He (the Prophet) said: Go and kill him. I saw him when the time of the afternoon prayer had come. I said: I am afraid if a fight takes place between me and him (Khalid b. Sufyan), that might delay the prayer. I proceeded walking towards him while I was praying by making a sign. When I reached near him, he said to me: Who are you ? I replied: A man from the Arabs; it came to me that you were gathering (any army) for this man (i.e. Prophet). Hence I came to you in connection with this matter. He said: I am (engaged) in this (work). I then walked along with him for a while ; when it became convenient for me, I dominated him with my sword until he became cold (dead).
1250 | Narrated Umm Habibah:The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: If anyone prays in a day and a night twelve rak'ahs voluntarily (supererogatory prayer), a house will be built from him in Paradise on account of these (rak'ahs).
1251 | Narrated Abd Allah b. Shaqiq:I asked A'ishah about the voluntary prayers offered by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She replied: Before the noon prayer he would pray four rak'ahs in my house, then go out and lead the people in prayer, then return to my house and pray two rak'ahs. He would lead the people in the sunset prayer, then return to my house and pray two rak'ahs. Then he would lead the people in the night prayer, and enter my house and pray two rak'ahs. He would pray nine rak'ahs during the night, including witr (prayer). At night he would pray for a long time standing and for a long time sitting. When he recited the Qur'an while standing, he would bow and prostrate himself from the standing position, and when he recited while sitting, he would bow and prostrate himself from the sitting position, and when dawn came he prayed two rak'ahs, then he would come out and lead the people in the dawn prayer.
1252 | Narrated Abd Allah b. 'Umar:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would pray two rak'ahs before and two after the noon prayer, two after the sunset prayer in his house, and two after the night prayer. He would not pray after the Friday prayer till he departed. He would then pray two rak'ahs.
1253 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Prophet (ﷺ) never omitted four rak'ahs before the noon prayer, and two rak'ahs before the dawn prayer.
1254 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was more particular about observing the supererogatory rak'ahs before the dawn prayer than about observing any of the other supererogatory prayers.
1255 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Prophet (ﷺ) would pray two rak'ahs before the dawn prayer lightly so much so that I would say: Did he recite Surah al-Fatihah in them.
1256 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Prophet (ﷺ) would recite in the two (supererogatory) rak'ahs of the dawn prayer: "Say, O unbelievers" [Surat al-Kafiroon:1] and "Say: He is Allah, the one" [Surat al-Ikhlas:1]
1257 | Narrated Bilal:      Ziyadah al-Kindi reported on the authority of Bilal that he (Bilal) came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to inform him about the dawn prayer. Aisha kept Bilal engaged in a matter which she asked him till the day was bright and it became fairly light. Bilal then stood up and called him to prayer and called him repeatedly. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not yet come out. When he came out, he led the people in prayer and he (Bilal) informed him that Aisha had kept him engaged in a matter which she asked him till it became fairly light; hence he became late in reaching him (in time). He (Bilal) said: Messenger of Allah, the dawn became fairly bright. He said: If the dawn became brighter than it is now, I would pray them (the two rak'ahs of the sunnah prayer), offer them well and in a more beautiful manner.
1258 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Do not omit them (the two rak'ahs before the dawn prayer) even if you are driven away by the horses.
1259 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite in both rak'ahs of the dawn prayer: "Say: We believe in Allah and in the revelation given to us" (3:84) . This is in the first rak'ah and in the second rak'ah (he recited): "We believe in Allah and bear witness that we submit ourself (to Him)." (3:52).
1260 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:That he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) recite in both rak'ahs of the dawn: "Say: We believe in Allah, and in the revelation given to us" (3:84). This is in the first rak'ah. In the second rak'ah he recited this verse: "Our Lord, we have believed in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger, so write us down among those who bear witness." or he recited: "Surely, we have sent you with the truth as a bringer of glad tidings, and a warner. And you will  not be asked about the inhabitants of the Blazing Fire" (2:119). Al-Darawardi doubted (which of the verse he recited).
1261 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If any of you prays two rak'ahs before the dawn prayer, he should lie at his right side.       Marwan ibn al-Hakam said to him: Is it not enough that one of us walks to the mosque until he lies at his right side? According to the version of Ubaydullah, he (AbuHurayrah) replied: No.       This statement (of AbuHurayrah) reached Ibn Umar. He said: AbuHurayrah exceed limits on himself. He was asked: Do you look askance at what he says? He replied: No, but he dared and we showed cowardice. This (criticism of Ibn Umar) reached AbuHurayrah. He said: What is my sin if I remembered and they forgot?
1262 | Narrated 'Aishah:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer late in the night, he would see. If I was awake, he would talk to me. If I was sleeping, he would awaken me, and pray two rak'ahs, then he would lie down as long as the mu'adhdhin came to him and call him for the dawn prayer. Then he would pray two rak'ahs lightly and come out for prayer.
1263 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) prayed the two rak'ahs of the dawn prayer, he would lie down if I was asleep; in case I was awake, he would talk to me.
1264 | Narrated AbuBakrah:      I came out with the Prophet (ﷺ) to offer the dawn prayer. When he passed by a sleeping man he called him for prayer or moved him with his foot. The narrator Ziyad said: This tradition has been reported to us by AbulFadl.
1265 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. Sarjas:A man came while the Prophet (ﷺ) was leading the people in the dawn prayer. He prayed the two rak'ahs and then joined the congregational prayer led by the Prophet (ﷺ). When he finished the prayer, the Prophet (ﷺ) said:  So-and-so, which was your real prayer, the one you prayed alone or the one offered with us ?
1266 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)as saying: When the iqamah is pronounced for prayer, no prayer is valid except the obligatory prayer.
1267 | Narrated Qays ibn Amr:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw a person praying after the congregational prayer at dawn was over. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There are two rak'ahs of the dawn prayer (i.e. the prescribed rak'ahs). The man replied: I did not pray the two rak'ahs before the dawn prayer. Hence I offered them now. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kept silent.
1268 | This tradition has also been transmitted by 'Ata b. Abi Rabah on the authority of Sa'd b. Sa'id through a different chain of narrators.   Abu Dawud said:'Abd Rabbihi and Yahya b. Sa'id also narrated this tradition from the Prophet (ﷺ) omitting the name of the Companion (mursal). Their grandfather Zaid prayed along with the Prophet (ﷺ).
1269 | Narrated Umm Habibah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone keeps on praying regularly four rak'ahs before and four after the noon prayer, he will not enter the Hell-fire.    Abu Dawud said: Al-'Ala' bin Al-Harith and Sulaiman bin Musa reported it from Makhul with his chain, similarly.
1270 | Narrated AbuAyyub:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The gates of heaven are opened for four rak'ahs containing no taslim (salutation) before the noon prayer.    Abu Dawud said: Yahya b. Sa'id al-Qattan said: If I were to narrate any tradition from 'Ubaidah, I would narrate this tradition.   Abu Dawud said: 'Ubaidah is weak.   Abu Dawud said: The name of the narrator Ibn Minjab is Sahm.
1271 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: May Allah show mercy to a man who prays four rak'ahs before the afternoon prayer.
1272 | Narrated 'Ali:That the Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray two rak'ahs before the 'Asr prayer.
1273 | Narrated Kuraib, the client of Ibn 'Abbas:That 'Abd Allah b. Abbas, 'Abd al-Rahman b. Azhar and al-Miswar b. Makhramah sent him to 'Aishah, wife of the Prophet (ﷺ). They said: Convey our regards to her from all of us and ask her about the two rak'ahs after the 'Asr prayer, and tell her that we have been informed that she prays them, and we are told that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited them. I entered upon her and told her that for which they had sent me to her. She said: Ask Umm Salamah. I returned to them (Ibn 'Abbas and others) and informed them about her opinion. They sent me back to Umm Salamah with the same mission for which they had sent me to 'Aishah. Umm Salamah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibiting them, but later on I saw him praying them. When he prayed them, he had offered the 'Asr prayer. He then came to me while a number of women from Banu Haram from the Ansar were sitting with me. He prayed these two rak'ahs. I sent a slave girl to him and I told her: Stand beside him and tell him that Umm Salamah has asked: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I heard you prohibiting these two rak'ahs (after the afternoon prayer) but I see you praying them yourself. If he makes a sign with his hand, step backward from him. The slave girl did so. When he finished prayer, he said: O daughter of Abu Umayyah, you asked about the praying of two rak'ahs after the 'Asr prayer, in fact, some people of 'Abd al-Qais has come to me with the news that their people had embraced Islam. They hindered me from praying the two rak'ahs after Zuhr prayer. It is those two rak'ahs (which I offered after the 'Asr prayer)
1274 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) prohibited to offer prayer after the afternoon prayer except at the time when the sun is high up in the sky.
1275 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would offer two rak'ahs after every obligatory prayer except the dawn and the 'Asr prayer.
1276 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Some reliable people testified before me, and among them was Umar ibn al-Khattab, and most reliable in my eyes was Umar: The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is no prayer after the dawn prayer until the sun rises; and there is no prayer after the 'Asr prayer until the sun sets.
1277 | Narrated Amr ibn Anbasah as-Sulami:      I asked: Messenger of Allah, in which part of night the supplication is more likely to be accepted?        He replied: In the last part: Pray as much as you like, for the prayer is attended by the angels and it is recorded till you offer the dawn prayer; then stop praying when the sun is rising till it has reached the height of one or two lances, for it rises between the two horns of the Devil, and the infidels offer prayer for it (at that time). Then pray as much as you like, because the prayer is witnessed and recorded till the shadow of a lance be- comes equal to it. Then cease prayer, for at that time the Hell-fire is heated up and doors of Hell are opened.        When the sun declines, pray as much as you like, for the prayer is witnessed till you pray the afternoon prayer; then cease prayer till the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of the Devil, and (at that time) the infidels offer prayer for it. He narrated a lengthy tradition.        Abbas said: AbuSalam narrated this tradition in a similar manner from AbuUmamah. If I have made a mistake unintentionally, I beg pardon of Allah and repent to Him.
1278 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Yasar, the client of Ibn Umar, said: Ibn Umar saw  me praying after the break of dawn. He said: O Yasar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us while we were offering this prayer. He (the Prophet) said: Those who are present should inform those who are absent: Do not offer any prayer after (the break of) dawn except two rak'ahs.
1279 | Al-Aswad and Masruq said:We bear witness that 'Aishah said: Not a day passed but the Prophet (ﷺ) prayed two rak'ahs after the 'Asr prayer
1280 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Dhakwan, the client of Aisha, reported on the authority of Aisha: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray after the afternoon prayer but prohibited others from it; and he would fast continuously but forbid others to do so.
1281 | Narrated 'Abd Allah al-Muzani:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Pray two rak'ahs before the Maghrib prayer. He then said (again): Pray two rak'ahs before the Maghrib prayer, it applies to those who wish to do so. That was because he feared that the people might treat it as sunnah.
1282 | Narrated Anas b. Malik :I offered two rak'ahs of prayer before the Maghrib prayer (i.e. obligatory) during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I (narrator al-Mukhtar b. Fulful) asked Anas: Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) se you ? He replied: Yes, but he neither commanded us nor forbade us (to do so).
1283 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. Mughaffal:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Between the two adhans there is a prayer, between the two adhans there is prayer for one who desires (to offer).
1284 | Narrated Tawus: Ibn 'Umar was asked about praying two rak'ahs before the Maghrib prayer. He replied: I did not see anyone praying them during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He (Ibn Umar) permitted to pray two rak'ahs after the Asr prayer.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Yahya b. Ma'in say: The correct name of the narrator Abu Shu'aib is the Shu'aib. Shu'bah made a mistake in narrating his name.
1285 | Narrated Abu Dharr: The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: In the morning alms are due for every bone in man's body. His salutation to everyone he meets is alms, his enjoining good is alms, his forbidding what is evil is alms, the removal of harmful thing from the way is alms, to have sexual intercourse with one's wife if alms, and two rak'ahs which one prays in the Duha serve instead of that.   Abu Dawud said: The tradition narrated by 'Abbad is more perfect (than the version narrated by Musaddad). Musaddad did not mention in his version "the command (of good) and the prohibition (of evil)". Instead, he added in his version saying: "Such and such." Ibn Ma'na added in his version: "They (the people) said: Messenger of Allah, how is that one of us fulfills his desire and still there are alms for him (i.e. is rewarded)? He replied: What do you think if you had unlawful sexual intercourse, would he not have been a sinner ?
1286 | Abu al-Aswad al-Dailani said:While we were present with Abu Dharr, he said: In the morning, alms are due for him, ever fast is alms, every pilgrimage is alms, every utterance of "Glory to be Allah" is alms, every utterance of "Allah is most great" is alms, every utterance of "Praise be to Allah" is alms. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recounted all such good works. He then said: Two rak'ahs which one prays in the Duha serve instead of that.
1287 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Anas al-Juhani:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone sits in his place of prayer when he finishes the dawn prayer till he prays the two rak'ahs of the forenoon, saying nothing but what is good, his sins will be forgiven even if they are more than the foam of the sea.
1288 | Narrated AbuUmamah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Prayer followed by a prayer with no idle talk between the two is recorded in Illiyyun.
1289 | Narrated Nu'aym ibn Hammar:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Allah, the Exalted, says: Son of Adam, do not be helpless in performing four rak'ahs for Me at the beginning of the day: I will supply what you need till the end of it.
1290 | Narrated Umm Hani ibn AbuTalib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed on the day of the Conquest (of Mecca) eight rak'ahs saluting after every two rak'ahs.   Abu Dawud said: Ahmad b. Salih said that the Messenger of Allah offered prayer in the forenoon on the day of the Conquest of Mecca, and he narrated something similar. Ibn al-Sarh reported that Umm Hani said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered upon me. This version does not mention the prayer in the forenoon.
1291 | Narrated Ibn Abi Laila:No one told us that the Prophet (ﷺ) had offered Duha prayer except Umm Hani. She said that the Prophet (ﷺ) had taken bath in her house on the day of the Conquest of Mecca and prayed eight rak'ahs. But no one saw him afterwards praying these rak'ahs.
1292 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. Shaqiq:I asked 'Aishah: Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pray in the Duha? She replied: No, except when he returned from his journey. I then asked: Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recite the surahs combining each other? She said: He would do so in the mufassal surahs.
1293 | Narrated 'Aishah, wife of Prophet (ﷺ):The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never offered prayer in the forenoon, but I offer it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would give up an action, though he liked it to do, lest the people should continue it and it is prescribed for them.
1294 | Narrated Simak:I asked Jabir b. Samurah: Did you sit in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ? He replied: Yes, very often. He would not stand from the place he prayed the dawn prayer till the sunrise. When the sun rose, he would stand (to pray Duha).
1295 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Prayer by night and day should consist of pairs of rak'ahs.
1296 | Narrated Muttalib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Prayer is to be offered in two rak'ahs; and you should recite the tashahhud at the end of two rak'ahs, and express your distress and humility and raise your hands and say praying: O Allah, O Allah. He who does not do so does not offer a perfect prayer.     Abu Dawud was asked about offering prayer at night in two rak'ahs. He said: They may be two if you like and four if you like.
1297 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to al-Abbas ibn AbdulMuttalib: Abbas, my uncle, shall I not give you, shall I not present to you, shall I not donate to you, shall I not produce for you ten things? If you act upon them, Allah will forgive you your sins, first and last, old and new, involuntary and voluntary, small and great, secret and open.        These are the ten things: you should pray four rak'ahs, reciting in each one Fatihat al-Kitab and a surah. When you finish the recitation of the first rak'ah you should say fifteen times while standing: "Glory be to Allah", "Praise be to Allah", "There is no god but Allah", "Allah is most great". Then you should bow and say it ten times while bowing. Then you should raise your head after bowing and say it ten times. Then you should kneel down in prostration and say it ten times while prostrating yourself. Then you should raise your head after prostration and say it ten times. Then you should prostrate yourself and say it ten times. Then you should raise your head after prostrating and say it ten times in every rak'ah. You should do that in four rak'ahs.        If you can observe it once daily, do so; if not, then once weekly; if not, then once a month; if not, then once a year; if not, then once in your lifetime.
1298 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr:      AbulJawza' said: A man who attended the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) narrated to me (it is thought that he was Abdullah ibn Amr): The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me: Come to me tomorrow; I shall give you something, I shall give you something, I shall reward you something, I shall donate something to you. I thought that he would give me some present.        He said (to me when I came to him): When the day declines, stand up and pray four rak'ahs. He then narrated something similar.        This version adds: Do not stand until you glorify Allah ten times, and praise Him ten times, and exalt Him ten times, and say, "There is no god but Allah" ten times. Then you should do that in four rak'ahs. If you are the greatest sinner on earth, you will be forgiven (by Allah) on account of this (prayer).        I asked: If I cannot pray this the appointed hour, (what should I do)? He replied: Pray that by night or by day (at any time).    Abu Dawud said: Habban b. Hilal is the maternal uncle of Hilal al-Ra'i.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by al-Mustamir b. al-Riyyan from Ibn al-Jawza' from 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr without referring to the Prophet (ﷺ), - narrated as a statement of 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr himself (mauquf). This has also been narrated by Rawh b. al-Musayyab, and Ja'far b. Sulaiman from 'Amr b. Malik al-Nakri from Abu al-Jauza' from Ibn 'Abbas as his own statement (and not the statement of the Prophet). But the version of Rawh has the words: "The tradition of the Prophet (ﷺ)."
1299 | Narrated 'Urwah b. Ruwaim:That an al-Ansari narrated to him: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Ja'far. He then narrated the tradition in like manner. This version has the words: "In the second prostration of the first rak'ah" in addition to the words transmitted by Mahdi b. Maimun (in the previous tradition).
1300 | Narrated Ka'b ibn Ujrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) came to the mosque of Banu AbdulAshhal. He prayed the sunset prayer there. When they finished the prayer, he saw them praying the supererogatory prayer after it. He said: This is the prayer to be offered in the houses.
1301 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to prolong the recitation of the Qur'an in the two rak'ahs after the sunset prayer until the people praying in the mosque dispersed.   Abu Dawud said: This has been reported by Nasr al-Mujaddir from Ya'qub al-Qummi with the same chain of narrators.   Abu Dawud said: Muhammad b. 'Isa b. al-tabba' transmitted from Nasr al-Mujaddir from Ya'qub in like manner.
1302 | Narrated Sa'id b. Jubair: This tradition from the Prophet (ﷺ) without mentioning the name of the Companion in the chain (in the mursal form).   Abu dawud said: I heard Muhammad b. Humaid say: I heard Ya'qub say: Anything I narrated to you from Ja'far on the authority of Sa'id b. Jubair from the Prophet (ﷺ) is directly coming from Ibn Abbas from the Prophet (ﷺ).
1303 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Shurayh ibn Hani said: I asked Aisha about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).  She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never offered the night prayer and thereafter came to me but he offered four or six rak'ahs of prayer. One night the rain fell, so we spread a piece of leather (for his prayer), and now I see as if there is a hole in it from which the water is flowing. I never saw him protecting his clothes from the earth (as he did on that occasion).
1304 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:      In Surat al-Muzzammil (73), the verse: "Keep vigil at night but a little, a half thereof" (2-3) has been abrogated by the following verse: "He knoweth that ye count it not, and turneth unto you in mercy. Recite then of the Qur'an that which is easy for you" (v.20). The phrase "the vigil of the night" (nashi'at al-layl) means the early hours of the night. They (the companions) would pray (the tahajjud prayer) in the early hours of the night.        He (Ibn Abbas) says: It is advisable to offer the prayer at night (tahajjud), prescribed by Allah for you (in the early hours of the night). This is because when a person sleeps, he does not know when he will awake. The words "speech more certain" (aqwamu qilan) means that this time is more suitable for the understanding of the Qur'an. He says: The verse: "Lo, thou hast by day a chain of business" (v.7) means engagement for long periods (in the day's work).
1305 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:When the opening verses of Surah Al-muzammil was revealed, the Companions would pray as long as they would pray during Ramadan until its last verses were revealed. The period between the revelation of its opening and the last verses was one year.
1306 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: When one you sleeps, the devil ties three knots at the back of his neck, sealing every knot with, "You have a long night, so sleep." So if one awakes and mentions Allah, a knot will be loosened; if he performs ablution another knot will be loosened; and if he prays, the third knot will be loosened; and in the morning he will be active and in good spirits; otherwise he will be in bad spirits and sluggish.
1307 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Do not give up prayer at night, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would not leave it. Whenever he fell ill or lethargic, he would offer it sitting.
1308 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: May Allah have mercy on a man who gets up at night and prays, and awakens his wife; if she refuses, he should sprinkle water on her face. May Allah have mercy on a woman who gets up at night and prays, and awakens her husband; if he refuses, she would sprinkle water on his face.
1309 | Narrated AbuSa'id and AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If a man awakens his wife at night, and then both pray or both offer two rak'ahs together, the (name of the )man will be recorded among those who mention the name of Allah, and the (name of the) woman will be recorded among those who mention the name of Allah. Ibn Kathir did not narrate this tradition as a statement of the Prophet (ﷺ), but he reported it as a statement of Abu Sa'id.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Ibn Mahdi from Sufyan and I think he mentioned the name of Sufyan. He also said: The tradition transmitted by Sufyan is a statement of the Companion (and not that of the Prophet).
1310 | Narrated 'Aishah, wife of Prophet (ﷺ):When one of you dozes in prayer he should sleep till his sleep is gone, for when one of you prays while he is dozing, perhaps he might curse himself if he begs pardon of Allah.
1311 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: When one of you gets up by night (to pray), and falters in reciting the Qur'an (due to sleep), and he does not understand what he utters, he should sleep.
1312 | Narrated Anas: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered the mosque (and saw that) a rope tied between two pillars. He asked: What is this rope (for) ? The people told him: This is (for) Hamnah b. Jahsh who prays (here). When she is tired, she reclines on it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: She should pray as much as she has strength. When she is tired, she should sit down.   This version of Ziyad has: He said: What is this ? The people told him: This is for Zainab who prays. When she becomes lazy, or is tired, she holds it. He said: Undo it. One of you should pray in good spirits. When he is lazy or tired, he should sit down.
1313 | Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: He who misses him daily round of recital or part of it due to sleep and he recites it between the dawn and the noon prayers, will be reckoned as if he recited it at night.
1314 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Any person who offers prayer at night regularly but (on a certain night) he is dominated by sleep will be given the reward of praying. His sleep will be almsgiving.
1315 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Our Lord who is blessed and exalted descends every night to the lowest heaven when the last one-third of the night remains, and says: Who supplicated Me so that I may answer him ? Who asks of Me so that I may give to him ? Who asks My forgiveness so that I may forgive him ?
1316 | Narrated 'Aishah:Allah, the Exalted, would awaken the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at night. When the dawn came, he would his finish daily round of recital.
1317 | Masruq said:I asked 'Aishah about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and I said to her: At what time he prayed at night ? She said: When he heard the cock crow, he got up and prayed.
1318 | Narrated 'Aishah:When he was with me he would sleep at dawn. By this she referred to the Prophet (ﷺ).
1319 | Hudhaifah said:When anything distressed the Prophet (ﷺ), he prayed.
1320 | Narrated Rab'iah b. Ka'b al-Aslami:I used to live with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at night. I would bring water for his ablution and his need. He asked: Ask me. I said: Your company in Paradise. He said: Is there anything other than that ? I said: It is only that. He said: Help me for yourself by making prostrations abundantly.
1321 | Anas b. Malik said (explaining the meaning of the Qur'anic verse "Who forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope, and spend of what We have bestowed on them" (32:16). The people used to remain awake between the sunset and the night prayers and would pray. Al-Hasan used to say:(This verse means) the prayer and vigil at night.
1322 | Anas said (explaining the meaning) of the following Qur'anic verse "They used to sleep but little of the night" (51:17):They (the people) used to pray between the Maghrib and 'Isha. The version of Yahya adds: The verse tatajafa junubuhum also means so.
1323 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: When one of you gets up at night, he should begin the prayer with two short rak'ahs.
1324 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Abu Hurairah through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version adds:He should then prolong it afterwards as much as he likes.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Hammad b. Salamah, Zuhair b. Mu'awiyah and a group of narrators from Hisham. They transmitted it as a statement of Abu Hurairah himself (mauquf).   This tradition has also been transmitted by Ibn 'Awn from Muhammad (b. Sirin). This version has the wordings: These two rak'ahs were short.
1325 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Habashi al-Khath'ami:      The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked: which is the best action? He replied: To stand in prayer for a long time.
1326 | Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:A man asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the prayer at night. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Prayer during the night should consist of pairs of rak'ahs, but if one of you fears the morning is near he should pray one rak'ah which will make his prayer an odd number for him.
1327 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet's (ﷺ) recitation was loud enough for one who was in the inner chamber to hear it when he was in the house.
1328 | Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Prophet's (ﷺ) recitation at night was partly in a loud voice and partly in a low voice.   Abu Dawud said: The name of Abu Khalid al-Walibi is Hurmuz.
1329 | Narrated AbuQatadah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) went out at night and found AbuBakr praying in a low voice, and he passed Umar ibn al-Khattab who was raising his voice while praying.        When they both met the Prophet (ﷺ) together, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: I passed by you, AbuBakr, when you were praying in a low voice.  He replied: I made Him hear with Whom I was holding intimate converse, Messenger of Allah.  He (the Prophet) said to Umar: I passed by you when you were praying in a loud voice.  He replied: Messenger of Allah, I was awakening the drowsy and driving away the Devil.        Al-Hasan added in his version: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Raise your voice a little, AbuBakr, and he said to Umar: Lower your voice a little.
1330 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Abu Hurairah through a different chain of narrators. This version dies not mention that the Prophet (ﷺ) said to Abu Bakr:Raise your voice a litte ; or he said to 'Umar: Lower your voice a little. But this version adds: (The Prophet said:) I heard you, Bilal, (reciting) ; you were reciting partly from this surah and partly from that surah. He said: This is all good speech ; Allah has combined one part with the other; The Prophet (ﷺ) said: All of you were correct.
1331 | Narrated 'Aishah: A man got up at night and recited the Qur'an in a loud voice. When the dawn came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: May Allah have mercy on so-and-so who reminded me many verses that I had nearly forgotten.   Abu Dawud said: Harun al-Nahwi transmitted from Hammad b. Salamah the Quranic verse of Surah Al-'Imran: "How many of the prophet fought (in Allah's way)" (3:146)
1332 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) retired to the mosque. He heard them (the people) reciting the Qur'an in a loud voice. He removed the curtain and said: Lo! every one of you is calling his Lord quietly. One should not trouble the other and one should not raise the voice in recitation or in prayer over the voice of the other.
1333 | Narrated Uqbah ibn Amir al-Juhani:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: One who recites the Qur'an in a loud voice is like one who gives alms openly; and one who recites the Qur'an quietly is one who gives alms secretly.
1334 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray ten rak'ahs during the night, and would observe the witr with one rak'ah, he then prayed two rak'ahs of the dawn prayer. Thus he prayed thirteen rak'ahs in all.
1335 | Narrated 'Aishah, wife of Prophet (ﷺ):The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray eleven rak'ahs (at night, observing the witr with one rak'ahs). When he finished it (the prayer), he would lie down on his right side.
1336 | Narrated 'Aishah:Between the time when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished the night prayer till the dawn broke, he used to pray eleven rak'ahs, uttering the salutation at the end of every two and observing the witr with a single one, and during that he would make a prostration about as long a one of you would take to recite fifty verses before raising his head. When the mu'adhdhin finished making the call for the dawn prayer, he stood up and prayed two short rak'ahs, then he lay down on his right side till the mu'adhdhin came to him
1337 | This tradition has been transmitted by Ibn Shihab through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version adds:He would observe witr with a single rak'ah and make a prostration as long as you would take to recite fifty verses before raising his head. When the mu'adhdhin finished his call for the dawn prayer and the dawn became clear to him.... Then the narrator transmitted the rest of the tradition to the same effect.   Some narrators added something more in their version.
1338 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray thirteen rak'ahs during the night, observing a witr out of that with five, he did not sit during the five except the last and then gave the salutation.  Abu Dawud said: Ibn Numair reported it from Hisham recently.
1339 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray thirteen rak'ahs during the night ; he then offered two light rak'ahs of prayer when he heard the call to the dawn prayer.
1340 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray thirteen rak'ahs during the night. He would offer eight rak'ahs observing the witr with one rak'ah. Then he prayed (the narrator Muslim said) two rak'ahs after witr prayer in sitting position. When he wished to bow, he stood up and bowed. He used to pray two rak'ahs between the call to the dawn prayer and the iqamah.
1341 | Abu Salamah b. 'Abd al-Rahman asked 'Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ):How did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pray during Ramadhan ? She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not pray more than eleven rak'ahs during Ramadhan and other than Ramadhan. He would pray four rak'ahs. Do not ask about their elegance and length. He then would pray for rak'ahs. Do not ask about their alegance and length. Then he would pray three rak'ahs. 'Aishah said: I asked: Messenger of Allah, do you sleep before observing witr ? He replied: 'Aishah, my eyes sleep, but my heart does not sleep.
1342 | Narrated Sa'd bin Hisham: I divorced my wife. I then came to Medina to sell my land that was there so that I could buy arms and fight in battle. I met a group of the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ). They said: Six persons of us intended to do so (i.e. divorce their wives and purchase weapons), but the Prophet (ﷺ) prohibited them. He said: For you in the Messenger of Allah there is an excellent model. I then came to Ibn 'Abbas and asked him about the witr observed by the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: I point to you a person who is most familiar with the witr observed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Go to 'Aishah. While going to her I asked Hakim b. Aflah to accompany me. He refused, but I adjured him. He, therefore, went along with me. We sought permission to enter upon 'Aishah. She said: Who is this ? He said: Hakim b. Aflah. She asked: Who is with you ? He replied: Sa'd b. Hisham. She said: Hisham son of 'Amir who was killed in the Battle of  Uhud. I said: Yes. She said: What a good man 'Amir was! I said: Mother of faithful, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She asked: Do you not recite the Quran ? The character of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was the Qur'an. I asked: Tell me about his vigil and prayer at night. She replied: Do you not recite: "O thou folded in garments" (73:1). I said: Why not ?   When the opening of this Surah was revealed, the Companions stood praying (most of the night) until their fett swelled, and the concluding verses were not revealed for twelve months from heaven. At last the concluding verses were revealed and the prayer at night became voluntary after it was obligatory. I said: Tell me about the witr of the Prophet (ﷺ). She replied: He used to pray eight rak'ahs, sitting only during the eighth of them. Then he would stand up and pray another rak'ahs. He would sit only after the eighth and the ninth rak'ahs. He would utter salutation only after the ninth rak'ah. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting and that made eleven rak'ahs, O my son. But when he grew old and became fleshy he observed a witr of seven, sitting only in sixth and seventh rak'ahs, and would utter salutation only after the seventh rak'ah. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting, and that made nine rak'ahs, O my son. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would not pray through a whole night, or recite the whole Qur'an in a night or fast a complete month except in Ramadan. When he offered prayer, he would do that regularly. When he was overtaken by sleep at night, he would pray twelve rak'ahs.   The narrator said: I came to Ibn 'Abbas and narrated all this to him. By Allah, this is really a tradition. Has I been on speaking terms with her, I would have come to her and heard it from her mouth. I said: If I knew that you were not on speaking terms with her, I would have never narrated it to you.
1343 | The above mentioned tradition has also been narrated by Qatadah through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:He (the Prophet( used to pray eight rak'ahs during which he did not sit except the eight rak'ahs. He would sit, make mention of Allah, supplicate Him and then utter the salutation so loudly that we could hear it. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting after he had uttered the salutation. Then he would pray one rak'ah, and that made eleven rak'ahs, O my son. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) grew old and became fleshy, he offered seven rak'ahs of witr, and then he would pray two rak'ahs sitting after he had uttered the salutation. The narrator narrated the tradition to the same effect till the end.
1344 | The above tradition has also been transmitted by Yahya b. Sa'id to the same effect. The version adds the words:"He uttered the salutation so loudly that we could hear it."
1345 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Sa'id through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. Ibn Bashshar narrated the tradition like that of Yahya b. Sa'id. His version has:He uttered the salutation in a way that we could hear it.
1346 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Zurarah ibn Awfa said that Aisha was asked about the midnight prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        She said: He used to offer his night prayer in congregation and then return to his family (in his house) and pray four rak'ahs. Then he would go to his bed and sleep, but the water for his ablution was placed covered near his head and his tooth-stick was also kept there until Allah awakened him at night.        He then used the tooth-stick, performed ablution perfectly then came to the place of prayer and would pray eight rak'ahs, in which he would recite Surah al-Fatihah, and a surah from the Qur'an as Allah willed. He would not sit during any of them but sit after the eighth rak'ah, and would not utter the salutation, but recite (the Qur'an) during the ninth rak'ah. Then he would sit and supplicate as long as Allah willed, and beg Him and devote his attention to Him; He would utter the salutation once in such a loud voice that the inmates of the house were almost awakened by his loud salutation. He would then recite Surah al-Fatihah while sitting, bow while sitting, and then recite the Qur'an during the second rak'ah, and would bow and prostrate while sitting. He would supplicate Allah as long as He willed, then utter the salutation and turn away.        This amount of prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) continued till he put a weight. During that period he retrenched two rak'ahs from nine and began to pray six and seven rak'ahs standing and two rak'ahs sitting. This continued till he died.
1347 | The above-mentioned tradition has also been narrated by Banu al-Hakim through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:He (the Prophet) would offer the night prayer and go to his bed. In this version there is no mention of praying four rak'ahs. The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition. This version further says: He would pray eight rak'ahs during which his recitation of the Qur'an, bowing and prostration were all equal. He would sit only after the eight rak'ah, and then stand up without uttering the salutation, and pray one rak'ah observing witr prayer and then give the salutation raising his voice so much so that we were about to awake. The narrator then transmitted the tradition to the same effect.
1348 | Zurarah b. Awfa said that 'Aishah was asked about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said:He used to lead the people in the 'Isha prayer and return to his family and pray four rak'ahs and go to his bed. The narrator then transmitted the tradition in full. This version does not mention the words: "During them (the rak'ahs) he equated all the recitation of the Qur'an, bowing and recitation." This also does not mention the words about the salutation: "Till he almost awakened us."
1349 | This tradition has also been transmitted by 'Aishah through a different chain of narrators. But the tradition narrated by Hammad b. Salamah is not equal to the tradition narrated by others.
1350 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray thirteen rak'ahs during the night, observing the witr prayer with nine (or as she said). He used to pray two rak'ahs while sitting and pray two rak'ahs of the dawn prayer between the adhan and the iqamah.
1351 | Narrated 'Aishah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to observe the witr prayer with nine rak'ahs. Then he used to pray seven rak'ahs (of witr prayer). He would pray two rak'ahs sitting after the witr in which he would recite the Qur'an (sitting). When he wished to bow, he stood up and bowed and prostrated.   Abu Dawud said: These two traditions have been transmitted by Khalid b. 'Abd Allah al-Wasiti. In his version he said: 'Alqamah b. Waqqas said: O mother, how did he pray the two rak'ahs ? He narrated the rest of the tradition to the same effect.
1352 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Sa'd ibn Hisham said: I came to Medina and called upon Aisha, and said to her: Tell me about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to lead the people in the night prayer, and then go to his bed and sleep. When midnight came he got up, went to answer the call of nature and to perform ablution with water. Having performed ablution, he entered the mosque and prayed eight rak'ahs.        To my mind he performed the recitation of the Qur'an, bowing and prostrating equally. He then observed witr with one rak'ah and prayed two rak'ahs sitting. Then he lay down on the ground. Sometimes Bilal came to him and called him for prayer. He then dozed, and sometimes I doubted whether he dozed or not, till he (Bilal) called him for prayer.        This is the prayer he offered till he grew old or put on weight. She then mentioned how he put on weight as Allah wished.
1353 | 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas said that he slept with the Prophet (ﷺ). He saw that he (the Prophet) awoke, used tooth-stick, performed ablution, and recited:"In the creation of the heavens and earth" [3:190] to the end of the surah. Then he stood up and prayed two rak'ahs in which he prolonged the standing, bowing, and prostrations. He then uttered turned away and slept till he bagan to snore. This he did three times. This made six rak'ahs in all. He would use tooth-stick, then perform ablution, and recite those verses. He then observed the witr prayer. The version of 'Uthman has: with three rak'ahs. The mu'adhdhin then came to him and he went out for prayer. The version of Ibn 'Isa adds: He then observed witr prayer ; then Bilal came to him and called him for prayer when the dawn broke. He then prayed the two rak'ahs of the dawn prayer. He then went out for prayer. Then both the narrators were agreed: He beagan to supplicate saying: O Allah, place light in my heart, light in my tongue, light in my hearing, light in my eyesight, light on my right hand, light on my left hand, light in front of me, light behing me, light below me, O Allah, give me abundant light.
1354 | The above tradition has also been transmitted by Husain through a different chain of narrators in like manner. This version has the words:"And give me abundant light."   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Abu Khalid al-Dalani from Habib and Salamah b. Kuhail from Abu Rishdin from Ibn 'Abbas in a similar manner.
1355 | Narrated Fadl b. 'Abbas: I spent a night with the Prophet (ﷺ) to see how he prayed. He got up, performed ablution and prayed two rak'ahs. His standing was like his bowing (i.e. equal in duration), and his bowing was like his prostration (equal in length). Then he slept. Afterwards he awoke, performed ablution, and used tooth-stick. He then recited five verses from Surah Al-'Imran : "In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day". He went on doing so till he prayed ten rak'ahs. He then stood up and prayed one rak'ah observing witr with it. In the meantime the mu'adhdhin called to prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up after the mu'adhdhin had kept silent. He prayed two light rak'ahs and remained sitting till he offered the dawn prayer.   Abu Dawud said: A part of the tradition transmitted by Ibn Bashshar remained hidden from me.
1356 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:I spent a night with my maternal aunt Maimunah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came after the evening has come. He asked: Did the boy pray ? She said: Yes. Then he lay down till a part of night had passed as much as Allah willed; he got up, performed ablution and prayed seven or five rak'ahs, observing witr with them. He uttered the salutation only in the last of them.
1357 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:I spent a night in the house of my maternal aunt Maimunah, daughter of al-Harith. The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the night prayer. He then came and prayed four rak'ahs and slept. He then stood up and prayed. I stood at his left side. He made me go round and made me stand at his right side. He then prayed five rak'ahs and slept, and I heard his snoring. He then got up and prayed two rak'ahs. Afterwards he came out and offered the dawn prayer.
1358 | Sa'id b. Jubair said that Ibn 'Abbas told him:He (the Prophet) got up and prayed eight rak'ahs in pairs, and then observed witr with five rak'ahs and he did not sit between them.
1359 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray thirteen rak'ahs, observing six rak'ahs in pairs including the two rak'ahs of dawn prayer. He would observe witr and five rak'ahs. He sat only in the last of them.
1360 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray thirteen rak'ahs during the night including the two rak'ahs of the dawn prayer.
1361 | Narrated 'Aishah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered the night prayer and then prayed eight rak'ahs standing, and two rak'ahs between the two adhans (i.e. the adhan for the dawn prayer and the iqamah). He never left them.   Jaf'ar b. Musafir said in his version: (He prayed) the two rak'ahs sitting between the two adhans. He added the word "sitting".
1362 | 'Abd Allah b. Abi Qais said that he asked 'Aishah:How many rak'ahs would the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pray observing the witr ? She said: He used to observe the witr with four and three, six and three, eight and three, and ten and three rak'ahs never observing less than seven or more than thirteen.   The narrator Ahmad added in his version: He would not observe the witr with two rak'ahs before the dawn. I asked: With what would he observe the witr ? She said: He would never leave it. The version of Ahmad does not mention the words "six and three (rak'ahs)".
1363 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Al-Aswad ibn Yazid said that he entered upon Aisha and asked her about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the night. She said: He used to pray thirteen rak'ahs during the night. Then he began to pray eleven rak'ahs and left two rak'ahs. When he died, he would pray nine rak'ahs during the night. His last prayer during the night was witr.
1364 | The client of Ibn 'Abbas said that he asked him:How would the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pray during the night ? He replied: I spent a night with him when he was with Maimunah. He slept and awoke when half the night or one-third of it had passed. He stood up and went to a leather bad containing water. He performed ablution and I also performed ablution with him. He then stood up and I also stood at his left side. He made me stand at his right side. He then put his hand upon my head, as he was touching my ear and awakening me. He then prayed two light rak'ahs and recited Surah al-Fatihah in each of them, and uttered the salutation. He then prayed eleven rak'ahs observing the witr and slept. Then Bilal came to him and said: Prayer, Messenger of Allah. He got up and prayed two rak'ahs, and then led the people in the prayer.
1365 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      I spent a night with my maternal aunt Maymunah. The Prophet (ﷺ) got up to pray at night. He prayed thirteen rak'ahs including two rak'ahs of the dawn prayer. I guessed that he stood in every rak'ah as long as one could recite Surah al-Muzzammil (73).
1366 | Khalid al-Juhani said:I shall watch the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at night. I slept at the threshold of his door or of his tent. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed two light rak'ahs, and then prayed two long, long, long rak'ahs. He then prayed two rak'ahs that were not so long as the two rak'ahs before them ; he then prayed two rak'ahs that were less in duration, than the rak'ahs before them; again he prayed two rak'ahs that were less in length then the preceding rak'ahs; he then prayed two rak'ahs that were less in length than the previous rak'ahs. This made altogether thirteen rak'ahs.
1367 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas:That he spent a night with Maimunah, wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), who was also his (Ibn 'Abbas's) maternal aunt. I lay towards the width of the pillow and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his wife slept towards its length. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) slept. When half the night passed, or a little before it or a little after it, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) awoke and began to rub his face (eyes) to remove the sleep. He then recited ten verses from the last part of Surah 'Al-Imran. Hen then came to a bag of water that was hanging. He performed ablution from it and performed his ablution well. He then stood up and prayed. I also got up and did as he did. I then went and stood at his side. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) placed his right hand upon my head and took me by my ear twisting it. He then prayed two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs. The narrator al-Qa'nabi said: Six times. He observed the witr prayer, and then slept until the mu'adhdhin came. He got up and prayed two light rak'ahs and then came out and offered the dawn prayer.
1368 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Choose such actions as you are capable of performing, for Allah does not grow weary till you do. The acts most pleasing to Allah are those which are done most continuously, even if they amount to little. Whenever he began an action, he would do it continuously.
1369 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Prophet (ﷺ) called 'Uthman b. Maz'un. When he came to him, he said: 'Uthman, did you dislike my practice ? He said: No, by Allah, but I seek your practice. He said: I sleep, I pray, I keep fast, I (sometimes) leave fast, and I marry women. Fear Allah, 'Uthman, your wife has a right on you, your guest has a right on you, your self has a right on you ; you should keep fast and (sometimes) leave fast, and pray and sleep.
1370 | 'Alqamah said:'Aishah was asked about the actions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Did he perform some actions exclusively on some particular days ? She said: No, he performed his actions regularly. Which of you has the strength as much as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had ?
1371 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to commend prayer at night during Ramadan, but did not command it as duty. He would say: If anyone prays during the night in Ramadan because of faith and seeking his reward from Allah, his previous sins will be forgiven for him. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, this was the practice, and it continued thus during Abu Bakr's caliphate and early part of 'Umar's.  Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by 'Uqail, Yunus, and Abu Uwais in like manner. The version of 'Uqail goes: He who fasts during Ramadan and prays during the night.
1372 | Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: If anyone fasts during Ramadan because of faith and in order to seek his reward from Allah, his previous sins will be forgiven to him. If anyone prays in the night of the power (lailat al-qadr) because of faith and in order to seek his reward from Allah his previous sins will be forgiven for him.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted in a similar manner by Yahya b. Abi Kathir and Muhammad b. 'Amr from Abu Salamah.
1373 | Narrated 'Aishah, wife of Prophet (ﷺ):That the Prophet (ﷺ) once offered (tarawih) prayer in the mosque and the people also prayed along with him. He then prayed on the following night, and the people gathered in large numbers. They gathered on the third night too, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come out to them. When the morning came, he said: I witnessed what you did, and nothing prevented me from coming out to you except that I feared that this (prayer) might be prescribed to you. That was in Ramadan.
1374 | Narrated 'Aishah:The people used to pray (tarawih prayer) in the mosque during Ramadan severally. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded me (to spread a mat). I spread a mat for him and he prayed upon it. The narrator then transmitted the same story. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: O People, praise be to Allah, I did not pass my night carelessly, nor did your position remain hidden from me.
1375 | Narrated AbuDharr:      We fasted with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during Ramadan, but he did not make us get up at night for prayer at any time during the month till seven nights remained; then he made us get up for prayer till a third of the night had passed. When the sixth remaining night came, he did not make us get up for prayer. When the fifth remaining night came, he made us stand in prayer till a half of the night had gone.        So I said: Messenger of Allah, I wish you had led us in supererogatory prayers during the whole of tonight.        He said: When a man prays with an imam till he goes he is reckoned as having spent a whole night in prayer. On the fourth remaining night he did not make us get up. When the third remaining night came, he gathered his family, his wives, and the people and prayed with us till we were afraid we should miss the falah (success).        I said: What is falah?  He said: The meal before daybreak. Then he did not make us get up for prayer during the remainder of the month.
1376 | Narrated 'Aishah: When the last ten days of Ramadan came, the Prophet (ﷺ) kept vigil and prayed during the whole night, and tied the wrapper tightly, and awakened his family (to pray during the night).   Abu Dawud said: The name of Abu Ya'fur is 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Ubaid b. Nistas.
1377 | Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out and saw that the people were praying during (the night of) Ramadan in the corner of the mosque. He asked: Who are these people ? It was said to him that those were people who had not learnt Quran. But Ubayy b. Ka'b is praying and they would pray behind him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: They did right and it is good what they did.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition is not strong, the narrator Muslim b. Khalid is weak.
1378 | Zirr (b. Hubaish) said:I said to Ubayy b. Ka'b: Tell me about lailat al-qadr, O Abu al-Mundhir, for our companion (Ibn Mas'ud) was questioned about it, and he said: Anyone who gets up for prayer every night all the year round will hit upon it (i.e. lailat al-qadr). He replied: May Allah have mercy on Abu 'Abd al-Rahman. By Allah, he knew that it was in Ramadan, (Musaddad's version goes) but he disliked that the people should content themselves (with that night alone); or he liked that the people should not content themselves (with the night alone). According to the agreed version: By Allah, it is the twenty-seventh night of Ramadan, without any reservation. I said: How did you know that, Abu al-Mundhir? He replied: By the indication (or sign) of which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) informed us. I asked Zirr: What is the sign ? He replied: The sun rises like a vessel of water in the morning following that night; it has no rays until it rises high up.
1379 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Unays:      I was present at the gathering of Banu Salamah, and I was the youngest of them.        They (the people) said: Who will ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for us about Laylat al-Qadr? That was the twenty-first of Ramadan. I went out and said the sunset prayer along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I then stood at the door of his house.        He passed by me and said: Come in. I entered (the house) and dinner was brought for him. I was prevented from taking food as it was scanty.        When he finished his dinner, he said to me: Give me my shoes. He then stood up and I also stood up with him. He said: Perhaps you have some business with me.        I said: Yes. Some people of Banu Salamah have sent me to you to ask you about Laylat al-Qadr. He asked: Which night: Is it tonight?        I said: Twenty-second.  He said: This is the very night. He then withdrew and said: Or the following night, referring to the twenty-third night.
1380 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Unays al-Juhani:      I said to the Messenger of Allah: I have a place in the desert where I live and in which I pray, with the praise of Allah; but give me command about a night when I come to this mosque.       He replied: Come on the twenty third night.       I (a sub-narrator, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim) said to his (Abdullah ibn Unays's) son: How would your father act?       He replied: He used to enter the mosque when he had offered the afternoon prayer, and did not leave it for any purpose till he prayed the morning prayer. Then when he had prayed the morning prayer, he found his riding beast at the door of the mosque, mounted it and got back to his desert.
1381 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: Seek laitat al-Qadr in the last ten night of Ramadan. When nine (nights) remain (i.e. on the twenty first) , when seven (night) remain (i.e. on the twenty third), and when five (nights) remain (i.e. on the twenty fifth).
1382 | Narrated Abu Sa’id Al Khudri :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to spend the middle ten days of Ramadan in retirement and devotion (i'tikaf) in the mosque. One year he had retirement and devotion in the mosque (as usual); when the twenty-first night came, and this night when he used to come out his devotion in the mosque, he said: He who has engaged himself in devotion along with me should do so during the last ten days; I saw that night, that was caused to forget it, but I have seen myself prostrating in water and mud on the morning following (that night), so seek it in the last ten days and seek it every night with an odd number. Abu sa'id said: Rain fell that night, the mosque that was thatched building dripped, and my eyes saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with the traces of water and mud, on his forehead on the morning following the twenty-first night.
1383 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Seek it (laylat al-Qadr) in the last ten days of Ramadan. Seek it on the ninth, seventh and fifth night. I (AbuNadrah) said: You know counting better than us, AbuSa'id. He said: Yes. I asked: What do you mean by the ninth, seventh and fifth night? He said: When the twenty-first night passes, the night which follows it is the night; when the twenty-third night passes, the night which follows it is the seventh; when the twenty-fifth passes, the night which follows it is the fifth.   Abu Dawud said: I do not know whether anything remained hidden from me or not.
1384 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to us: Seek it (laylat al-Qadr) on the seventeenth night of Ramadan, and on the twenty first night, and on the twenty-third night. He then kept silence.
1385 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Seek lailat al-qadr in the last seven days.
1386 | Narrated Mu'awiyah b. Abi Sufyan :The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: Lailat al-qadr is the twenty-seventh night (of Ramadan)
1387 | Narrated 'Abd Allah bin 'Amr: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked about lailat al-qadr and I was hearing: He said: It is during the whole of Ramadan.   Abu Dawud said: Sufyan and Shu'bah narrated this tradition from Abu Ishaq as a statement of Ibn 'Umar himself, they did not transmit it as a saying of the Prophet (ﷺ)
1388 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr: The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying to him: Complete the recitation of the Qu'ran in one month. He said: I have more strength. He (the Prophet) said: Complete the recitation in twenty days. He again said: I have more energy. He said : Recite in fifteen days. He again said: I have more energy. He said: Recite in ten days. He again said: I have more energy. He said: Recite in seven days, do not add to it.   Abu Dawud said: The tradition narrated by Muslim is more perfect.
1389 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Keep fast for three days of month, and finish the recitation of the Qur'an in one month. I and he differed among ourselves on period of time. He said: Fast one day and give it up other day. The narrator 'Ata said: The people differed from my father (in narrating the period of time). Some narrated seven days and others five.
1390 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      Yazid ibn Abdullah said that Abdullah ibn Amr asked the Prophet (ﷺ): In how many days should I complete the recitation of the whole Qur'an, Messenger of Allah?       He replied: In one month.       He said: I am more energetic to complete it in a period less than this. He kept on repeating these words and lessening the period until he said: Complete its recitation in seven days.       He again said: I am more energetic to complete it in a period less than this.       The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who finishes the recitation of the Qur'an in less than three days does not understand it.
1391 | Khaithamah reported that 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Recite the Qur'an in one month. I said: I have (more) energy. He said: Recite it in three days   Abu 'Ali said: I heard Abu Dawud say: I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: The narrator 'Isa b. Shadhan is a sane person.
1392 | Ibn al-Had said:Nafi' b. Jubair asked me: In how many days do you recite the Qur'an ? I said: I have not fixed any part from it for daily round. Nafi' said to me: Do not say: I do not fix any part of it for daily round, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I recited a part of the Qur'an.   The narrator Ibn al-Had said: I think I have transmitted this tradition from al-Mughirah b. Shu'bah.
1393 | Narrated Aws ibn Hudhayfah:      We came upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a deputation of Thaqif. The signatories of the pact came to al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah as his guests. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made Banu-Malik stay in a tent of his.        Musaddad's version says: He was in the deputation of Thaqif which came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He used to visit and have a talk with us every day after the night prayer.        The version of AbuSa'id says: He remained standing for such a long time (talking to us) that he put his weight sometimes on one leg and sometimes on the other due to his long stay. He mostly told us how his people, the Quraysh, behaved with him.        He would say: We were not equal; we were weak and degraded at Mecca (according to Musaddad's version). When we came over to Medina the fighting began between us; sometimes we overcome them and at other times they overcome us. One night he came late and did not come at the time he used to come.        We asked him: You came late tonight?  He said: I could not recite the fixed part of the Qur'an that I used to recite every day. I disliked to come till I had completed it.        Aws said: I asked the companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): How do you divide the Qur'an for daily recitation?  They said: Three surahs, five surahs, eleven surahs, thirteen surahs' mufassal surahs.    Abu Dawud said: The version of Abu Sa'id is complete.
1394 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who recites the Qur'an in a period less than three days does not understand it.
1395 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      Wahb ibn Munabbih said: Abdullah ibn Amr asked the Prophet (ﷺ); In how many days should one complete the recitation of the Qur'an? He said: In forty days. He then said: In one month. He again said: In twenty days. He then said: In fifteen days. He then said: In ten days. Finally he said: In seven days.
1396 | Narrated Ibn Mas'ud:      Alqamah and al-Aswad said: A man came to Ibn Mas'ud. He said: I recite the mufassal surahs in one rak'ah. You might recite it quickly as one recites verse (poetry) quickly, or as the dried dates fall down (from the tree).        But the Prophet (ﷺ) used to recite two equal surahs in one rak'ah; he would recite (for instance) surahs an-Najm (53) and ar-Rahman (55) in one rak'ah, surahs Iqtarabat (54) and al-Haqqah (69) in one rak'ah, surahs at-Tur (52) and adh-Dhariyat (51) in one rak'ah, surahs al-Waqi'ah (56) and Nun (68) in one rak'ah, surahs al-Ma'arij (70) and  an-Nazi'at (79) in one rak'ah, surahs al-Mutaffifin (83) and Abasa (80) in one rak'ah, surahs al-Muddaththir (74) and al-Muzzammil (73) in one rak'ah, surahs al-Insan (76) and al-Qiyamah (75) in one rak'ah, surahs an-Naba' (78) and  al-Mursalat (77) in one rak'ah, and surahs ad-Dukhan (44) and at-Takwir (81) in one rak'ah.   Abu Dawud said: This is the arrangement of Ibn Mas'ud himself
1397 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Yazid said:I asked Abu Mas'ud while he was making circumambulation of the Ka'bah (about the recitation of some verses from the Qur'an). He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If anyone recited two verses from the last of Surah al-Baqarah at night, they will be sufficient for him.
1398 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone prays at night reciting regularly ten verses, he will not be recorded among the negligent; if anyone prays at night and recites a hundred verses, he will be recorded among those who are obedient to Allah; and if anyone prays at night reciting one thousand verses, he will be recorded among those who receive huge rewards.   Abu Dawud said: The name of Ibn Hujairah al-Asghar is 'Abd Allah b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Hujairah.
1399 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr:      A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Teach me to read the Qur'an, Messenger of Allah.        He said: Read three surahs which begin with A.L.R.  He said: My age is advanced, my mind has become dull (i.e. memory has grown weak), and my tongue has grown heavy). So he said: Then read three surahs which begin with H.M. He repeated the same words.  So he said: Read three surahs which begin with the "Glorification of Allah". But he repeated the same excuse.  The man then said: Teach me a comprehensive surah, Messenger of Allah. The Prophet (ﷺ) taught him Surah (99). "When the Earth is shaken with her earthquake". When he finished it, the man said: By Him Who sent you with truth, I shall never add anything to it. Then man then went away.        The Prophet (ﷺ) said twice:  The man received salvation.
1400 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A surah of the Qur'an containing thirty verses will intercede its reader till he will be forgiven. That is: "Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the sovereignty" (Surah 67).
1401 | Narrated Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) taught me fifteen prostrations while reciting the Qur'an, including three in al-Mufassal and two in Surah al-Hajj.   Abu Dawud said: Abu al-Darda' has reported eleven prostrations from the Prophet (ﷺ), but chain of this tradition is weak.
1402 | Narrated Uqbah ibn Amir:      I said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Are there two prostrations in Surah al-Hajj? He replied: Yes; if anyone does not make two prostrations, he should not recite them.
1403 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not make a prostration at any verse in al-Mufassal from the time he moved to Medina.
1404 | On the authority of Zaid bin Thabit, he said:"I recited to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Surat) An-Najm and he did not prostrate in it."
1405 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Zaid b. Thabit through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.   Abu Dawud said:Zaid was imam (in a prayer) and he did not make prostration.
1406 | Narrated 'Abd Allah (b. Mas'ud):The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited Surah al-Najm and prostrated himself. No one remained there who did not prostrate (along with him). A man from the people took a handful of pebbles or dust and raised it to his face saying: This is enough for me. 'Abd Allah (b. Mas'ud) said: I later saw him killed as an infidel.
1407 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:We prostrated ourselves along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on account of: "When the sky is rent asunder" and "Recite in the name of Your Lord Who created"
1408 | Narrated Abu Rafi':I offered the night prayer behind Abu Hurairah. He recited Surah Inshiqaq ("When the sky is rent asunder") and prostrated himself. I asked him: What is this prostration ? He replied: I prostrated myself on account of this (surah) behind Abu al-Qasim (i.e. the Prophet). I shall continue prostrating on account of this till I meet him.
1409 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:A prostration when reciting Sad is not one of those which are divinely commanded, but I have seen Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prostrate himself.
1410 | Narrated Sa'id al-Khudri:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited surah Sad on the pulpit. When he reached the place of prostration (in the surah), he descended and prostrated himself and the people prostrated with him. When the next day came, he recited it. When he reached the place of prostration (in the surah), the people became ready for prostration. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is the repentance of a Prophet ; but I saw you being ready for prostration. So he descended and prostrated himself and the people prostrated along with him.
1411 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      In the year of Conquest the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited a verse at which a prostration should be made and all the people prostrated themselves. Some were mounted, and some were prostrating themselves on the ground, and those who were mounted prostrated themselves on their hands.
1412 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would recite to us a surah (according to the version of Ibn Numair) outside the prayer (the agreed version goes), then he would prostrate along with him, and none of us could find a place for his forehead.
1413 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite the Qur'an to us. When he came upon the verse containing prostration, he would utter the takbir (Allah is most great) and we would prostrate ourselves along with him.    The narrator 'Abd al-Razzaq said: Al-Thawri liked this tradition very much.   Abu Dawud said: This was liked by him for this contains the uttering of takbir.
1414 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prostrated himself at night when reciting the Qur'an. He said repeatedly: My face prostrates itself to Him Who created it and brought forth its hearing and seeing by His might and power.
1415 | Narrated AbuTamimah al-Hujaymi:      When we came to Medina accompanying the caravan, I used to preach after the dawn prayer, and prostrate on account of the recitation of the Qur'an. Ibn Umar prohibited me three times, but I did not cease  doing that. He then repeated (his prohibition) saying: I prayed behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), AbuBakr, Umar and Uthman, they would not prostrate (on account of the recitation of the Qur'an) till the sun had risen.
1416 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Allah is single (witr) and loves what is single, so observe the witr, you who follow the Qur'an.
1417 | The above mentioned tradition has also been narrated by 'Abd Allah (b. Mas'ud) through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version adds:A bedouin said: What are you saying ? He replied: This is neither for you, nor for your companions.
1418 | Narrated Kharijah ibn Hudhafah al-Adawi:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out to us and said: Allah the Exalted has given you an extra prayer which is better for you then the red camels (i.e. high breed camels). This is the witr which Allah has appointed for you between the night prayer and the daybreak.
1419 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: The witr is a duty, so he who does not observe it does not belong to us; the witr is a duty, so he who does not observe it does not belong to us; the witr is a duty, so he who does not observe it does not belong to us.
1420 | Narrated Ubadah ibn as-Samit:      Ibn Muhayriz said: A man from Banu Kinanah, named al-Makhdaji, heard a person called AbuMuhammad in Syria, saying: The witr is a duty (wajib).       Al-Makhdaji said: So I went to Ubadah ibn as-Samit and informed him.       Ubadah said: AbuMuhammad told a lie. I heard the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) say: There are five prayers which Allah has prescribed on His servants. If anyone offers them, not losing any of them, and not treating them lightly, Allah guarantees that He will admit him to Paradise. If anyone does not offer them, Allah does not take any responsibility for such a person. He may either punish him or admit him to Paradise.
1421 | Ibn 'Umar said:A man who lived in the desert asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the prayer at night. He made a sign with his two fingers-in this way in pairs. The witr consists of one rak'ah towards the end in night.
1422 | Narrated AbuAyyub al-Ansari:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The witr is a duty for every Muslim so if anyone wishes to observe it with five rak'ahs, he may do so; if anyone wishes to observe it with three, he may do so, and if anyone wishes to observe it with one, he may do so.
1423 | Narrated Ubayy ibn Ka'b:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to observe witr with (reciting) "Glorify the name of thy Lord, the most High" (Surah 87), "Say O disbelievers" (Surah 109), and "Say, He is Allah, the One, Allah, the eternally besought of all" (112).
1424 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      AbdulAziz ibn Jurayj said: I asked Aisha, mother of the believers: With which (surah) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to observe witr? (She reported same as in the Hadith of Ubayy ibn Ka'b, No. 1418)       This version adds: In the third rak'ah he would recite: "Say, He is Allah, the One" (Surah 112), and  "Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak" (Surah 113), and "Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind" (Surah 114).
1425 | Narrated Al-Hasan ibn Ali:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught me some words that I say during the witr. (The version of Ibn Jawwas has: I say them in the supplication of the witr.) They were: "O Allah, guide me among those Thou hast guided, grant me security among those Thou hast granted security, take me into Thy charge among those Thou hast taken into Thy charge, bless me in what Thou hast given, guard me from the evil of what Thou hast decreed, for Thou dost decree, and nothing is decreed for Thee. He whom Thou befriendest is not humbled. Blessed and Exalted art Thou, our Lord."
1426 | The aforesaid tradition has been transmitted by Abu Ishaq with the same chain and to the same effect. In the last of this tradition he said:The version has the words: "He would recite the supplication of the witr." He did not mention the words: "I say them in the witr."   Abu Dawud said: The name of Abu al-Hawra' is Rabi'ah b. Shaiban.
1427 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say at the end of his witr: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Thy good pleasure from Thy anger, and in Thy forgiveness from Thy punishment, and I seek refuge in Thy mercy from Thy wrath. I cannot reckon the praise due to Thee. Thou art as Thou hast praised Thyself."    Abu Dawud said: Hisham is the earliest teacher of Hammad. Yahya b. Ma'in said: No one is reported to have narrated traditions form him except Hammad b. Salamah.   Abu Dawud said: Ubayy b. Ka'b said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited supplication in the witr before bowing.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been narrated by 'Isa b. Yunus through a different chain of narrators from Ubayy b. Ka'b. He also narrated it through a different chain of narrators on the authority of Ubayy b. Ka'b that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited the supplication in the witr before bowing.   Abu Dawud said: The chain of narrators of the tradition of Sa'id from Qatadah goes: Yazid b. Zurai' narrated from Sa'id, from Qatadah, from 'Azrah, from Sa'id b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abza, on the authority of his father, from the Prophet (ﷺ). This version does not mention the supplication and the name of Ubayy. This tradition has also been narrated by 'Abd al-A'la and Muhammad b. Bishr al-'Abdi. He heard the traditions from 'Isa b. Yunus at Kufah. They did not mention the supplication in their version.   This tradition has also been narrated by Hisham al-Dastuwa'i and Shu'bah from Qatadah. They did not mention the supplication in their version. The tradition of Zubaid has been narrated by Sulaiman al-A'mash, Shu'bah, 'Abd al-Malik b. Abi Sulaiman, and Jarir b. Hazim; all of them narrated on the authority of Zubaid. None of them mention the supplication in his version, except in the tradition transmitted by Hafs b. Ghiyath from Mis'ar from Zubaid; he narrated in his version that he (the Prophet) recited supplication before bowing.   Abu Dawud said: This version of tradition is not well know. There is doubt that Hafs might have narrated this tradition from some other narrator than Mis'ar.   Abu Dawud said: It is reported that Ubayy (b. Ka'b) used to recited the supplication )in the witr) in the second half of Ramadan.
1428 | Muhammad reported on the authority of some of his teachers that Ubayy b. Ka'b led them in prayer during Ramadan. He used to recite the supplication (in the witr) during the second half of Ramadan.
1429 | Narrated Ubayy ibn Ka'b:      Al-Hasan reported: Umar ibn al-Khattab gathered the people (in tarawih prayer) behind Ubayy ibn Ka'b (who led them). He used to lead them for twenty days (during Ramadan, and would not recite the supplication except in the second half of it (i.e. Ramadan). When the last ten days remained, he kept away from them, and prayed in his house. They used to say: Ubayy ran away.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition shows that whatever has been reported about the recitation of the supplication is not tenable. Moreover, these two traditions from Ubayy b. Ka'b indicate that another tradition which tells that the Prophet (ﷺ) recited the supplication in the witr is weak.
1430 | Narrated Ubayy ibn Ka'b:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered salutation in the witr prayer, he said: Glorify be to the king most holy.
1431 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone oversleeps and misses the witr, or forgets it, he should pray when he remembers.
1432 | Abu Hurairah said:My friend (i.e. the Prophet) instructed me to observe three practices that I do not leave while traveling nor while resident, to pray two rak`ahs in the forenoon, to fast three days every month and not to sleep but after observing the witr.
1433 | Abu Al-Darda' said:My friend (i.e. 	the Prophet) instructed me to observe three practices which I never leave: he instructed me to fast three days every month, and not to sleep but after observing the witr, and to observe supererogatory prayer in the forenoon while traveling and while resident.
1434 | Narrated AbuQatadah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) asked AbuBakr: When do you observe the witr?       He replied: I observe the witr prayer in the early hours of the night.       The Prophet (ﷺ) asked Umar: When do you observe the witr?       He replied: At the end of the night.       He then said to AbuBakr: This has followed it with care; and he said to Umar: He has followed it with strength.
1435 | Masruq said:I asked 'Aishah: When would the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observe the witr prayer ? She replied: Any time he observed the witr, sometimes in the early hours of the night, sometimes at midnight and sometimes towards the end of it. But he used to observe the witr just before the dawn when he died.
1436 | Ibn 'Umar reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:Make haste to observe the witr prayer before morning.
1437 | 'Abd Allah b. Abu Qais said:I asked 'Aishah about the witr observes by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She replied: Sometime he observed the witr prayer in the early hours of the night, sometimes he observed it at the end of it. I asked: How did he recite the Qur'an ? Did he recite the Qur'an quietly or loudly ? She replied: He did it in any way. Sometimes he recited quietly and sometimes loudly, sometimes he took bath and then slept and sometimes he performed ablution and then slept.   Abu Dawud said: The narrators other than Qutaibah said: This refer to his bath due to sexual defilement.
1438 | Ibn 'Umar reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as suing:Make the last of your prayer at night a witr.
1439 | Narrated Talq ibn Ali:      Qays ibn Talq said: Talq ibn Ali visited us on a certain day during Ramadan. He remained with us till evening and broke fast with us. He then stood up and led us in the witr prayer.       He then went to his mosque and led them in prayer. When the witr remained, he put forward another man and said: Lead your companions in the witr prayer, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: There are no two witrs during one night.
1440 | Abu Hurairah said:By Allah, I shall offer prayer like that of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The narrator said: Abu Hurairah used to recite the supplication in the last rak'ah of the noon, night and dawn prayers. He would supplicate for the believers and curse the disbelievers.
1441 | Al-Bara' said:The Prophet (ﷺ) used to recite the supplication in the dawn prayer. The version of Ibn Mu'adh has the words: "sunset prayer".
1442 | Abu Hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited the supplication in the night prayer for a month. He said (in his supplication): O Allah, rescue al-Walid b. al-Walid, rescue Salamah b. Hisham, rescue the weak believers; O Allah, trample severely on Mudar;  O Allah, cause them a famine like that of Joseph. Abu Hurairah said: One morning the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) id not make supplication for them. So I told him about it. He said: You dod not see that they have come (back).
1443 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited the supplication (Qunut) daily for a month at the noon, afternoon, sunset, night and morning prayers. When he said: "Allah listens to him who praises Him" in the last rak'ah, invoking a curse on some clans of Banu Sulaym, Ri'l, Dhakwan and Usayyah, and those who were standing behind him said: Amen.
1444 | Muhammad reported:Anas b. Malik was asked whether the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had recited supplication in the dawn prayer. He replied: Yes. He was again asked whether before bowing or after bowing. He said after bowing.   This version of Musaddad adds the words: "For a short period."
1445 | Anas b. Malik said:The Prophet (ﷺ) recited the supplication for a month (in prayer) and then gave it up.
1446 | Narrated Someone who prayed with the Prophet:      Muhammad ibn Sirin said: Someone who prayed the morning prayer along with the Prophet (ﷺ) narrated to me: When he raised his head after the second rak'ah, he remained standing for a short while.
1447 | Zaid b. Thabit said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) built a chamber in the mosque. He used to come out at night and pray there. They (the people) also prayed along with him. They would come (to prayer) every night. If on any night the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come out, they would cough, raise their voices and throw pebbles and sand on his door. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out to time in anger and said: O People, you kept on doing this till I thought that it will be prescribed for you.

'Abd Allah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to teach us the supplication for isthikharah (seeking what us beneficial from Allah) as he would teach us a surah (chapter) from the Qur'an. He would tell us: When one of you intends to do a work, he should offer two supererogatory rak'ahs of prayer, and then say (at the end of the prayer): "O Allah, I seek Your choice on the better (of the two matters) based upon Your knowledge, and I seek Your decree based upon Your power, and I ask You for Your great bounties. For Indeed, You are the One Who Decrees, and I do not decree, and You know, and I do not know, and You are the Knower of the Unseen. O Allah, if you know this, and You are the Knower of the Unseen. O Allah, if you know this - here he should name exactly what he wishes - is better for me with regard to my religion, and my life, and my afterlife, and the end result of my affairs, then decree it to me, and make it easy for me, and bless me on it. O Allah, and if You know this to be evil for me - and he says just as he said the first time - then avert it for me, and avert me from it. And decree for me good wherever it might be, the make me content with it." A version goes: "If the work is good immediately or subsequently."   Ibn Maslamah and Ibn 'Isa reported from Muhammad b. al-Munkadir on the authority of Jabir.

1541 | Anas b. Malik said:I used to serve the Prophet (ﷺ) and often hear him say: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from grief and anxiety,  from the hardships of debt, and from being overpowered by men."
1542 | 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to teach us this supplication as he taught us the surah from the Qur'an. He would say: O Allah! I seek refuge in You from the punishment of Hell and I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the grave, and I seek refuge from You from the trails of Al-Masihid-Dajjal, and I seek refuge in You from the trials of life and death.
1543 | 'Aishah narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) would supplicate with the following words:"O Allah! I seek refuge in You from the trials of the Fire, and the punishment of the Fire, and from the evils of richness and  poverty."
1544 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to say: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from poverty", lack and abasement, and I seek refuge in Thee lest I cause or suffer wrong."

1551 | Narrated Shakl ibn Humayd:      I said: Messenger of Allah, teach me a supplication.

1552 | Narrated AbulYusr:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to supplicate: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from my house falling on me, I seek refuge in Thee from falling into an abyss, I seek refuge in Thee from drowning burning and decrepitude. I seek refuge in Thee from the devil harming me at the time of my death, I seek refuge in Thee from dying in Thy path while retreating, and I seek refuge in Thee from dying of the sting of a poisonous creature."
1553 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Abu al-Yusr through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:"and from sorrow".
1554 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to say: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from leprosy, madness, elephantiasis, and evil diseases."

He said: What is the matter that I am seeing you sitting in the mosque when there is no time of prayer?       He said: I am entangled in cares and debts, Messenger of Allah.       He replied: Shall I not teach you words by which, when you say them, Allah will remove your care, and settle your debt?       He said: Why not, Messenger of Allah?       He said: Say in the morning and evening: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from care and grief, I seek refuge in Thee from incapacity and slackness, I seek refuge in Thee from cowardice and niggardliness, and I seek in Thee from being overcome by debt and being put in subjection by men."       He said: When I did that Allah removed my care and settled my debt.
1556 | Abu Hurairah said When the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) died and Abu Bakr was made his successor after him and certain Arab clans apostatized. Umar bin Al Khattab said to Abu Bakr How can you fight with the people until they say “There is no God but Allah” so whoever says “There is no God but Allah”, he has protected his property  and his person from me except for what is due from him, and his reckoning is left to allah. Abu Bak replied I swear by Allah that I will certainly fight with those who make a distinction between prayer and zakat, for zakat is what is due from property. I swear by Allah that if they were to refuse me a rope of camel (or a female kid, according to another version)which they used to pay the Messenger of Allah, I will fight with them over the refusal of it. Umar bin Al Khattab said I swear by Allah, I clearly saw Allah had made Abu Bakr feel justified in tighting and I recognized that it was right. Abu Dawud said This tradition has been transmitted by Rabah bin Zaid from Ma’mar and Al Zaubaidi from Al Zuhri has “If they were to refuse me a female kid.” The version transmitted by ‘Anbasah from Yunus on the authority of Al Zuhri has “a female kid”.
1557 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Al Zuhri through a different chain of narrators. This version has “Abu Bakr said its due is the payment of zakat.” He used the word “a rope of a Camel”
1558 | Abu Sa’id Al Khudri reported:That the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying No sadaqah(zakat) is payable on less than five camels, on less than five ounces of silver and on less than five camel loads(wasq).
1559 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no zakat payable (on grain or dates) on less than five camel-loads. The wasq (one camel-load) measures sixty sa' in weight.
1560 | Ibrahim said The wasq contained sixty sa’s stamped with the stamp of Al Hajjaj.
1561 | Habib al-Maliki said:A man said to Imran ibn Husayn: AbuNujayd, you narrate to us traditions whose basis we do not find in the Qur'an.       Thereupon, Imran got angry and said to the man: Do you find in the Qur'an that one dirham is due on forty dirhams (as Zakat), and one goat is due on such-and-such number of goats, and one camel will be due on such-and-such number of camels?       He replied: No.       He said: From whom did you take it? You took it from us, from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).       He mentioned many similar things.
1562 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to order us to pay the sadaqah (zakat) on what we prepared for trade.
1563 | 'Amr bin Shu'aib on his father's authority said that his grandfather reported:   A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and she was accompanied by her daughter who wore two heavy gold bangles in her hands. He said to her: Do you pay zakat on them? She said: No. He then said: Are you pleased that Allah may put two bangles of fire on your hands?       Thereupon she took them off and placed them before the Prophet (ﷺ) saying: They are for Allah and His Apostle.
1564 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      I used to wear gold ornaments. I asked: Is that a treasure (kanz), Messenger of Allah? He replied: whatever reaches a quantity on which zakat is payable is not a treasure (kanz) when the zakat is paid.
1565 | Narrated ‘Abdallah bin Shaddad bin Al Had :We entered upon A’ishah, wife of the Prophet (ﷺ). She said The Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) entered upon me and saw two silver rings in my hand. He asked What is this, Aishah? I said I have made two ornaments myself for you, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He asked Do you pay zakat on them? I said No or I said Whatever Allah willed. He said this is sufficient for you (to take you) to the Hell fire.
1566 | The aforesaid tradition has also been narrated by ‘Umar bin Ya’la through a different chain of narrators, like the tradition of ring. Sufyan, a narrator, was asked How do you pay zakat on it. He said You may combine it with other (ornaments).
1567 | Narrated Hammad : I took a letter from Thumamah bin ‘Abd Allah bin Anas. He presumed that Abu Bakr had written it for Anas when he sent him (to Al Bahrain) as a collector of zakat. This (letter) was stamped with the stamp of the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) and was written by Abu Bakr for him(Anas). This letter goes “This is the obligatory sadaqah(zakat) which the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) imposed on Muslims which Allah commanded his Prophet(ﷺ) to impose. Those Muslims who are asked for the proper amount must give it, but those who are asked for more than that must not give it. For less than twenty five Camels a goat is to be given for every five Camels. When they reach twenty five to thirty five, a she Camel in her second year is to be given. If there is no she Camel in her second year, a male Camel in its third year is to be given. When they reach thirty six to forty five, a she Camel in her third year is to be given. When they reach forty six to sixty , a she Camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a stallion is to be given. When they reach sixty one to seventy five, a she Camel in her fifth year is to be given. When they reach seventy six to ninety, two she Camel in their third year are to be given. When they reach ninety one to a hundred and twenty, two she Camels in their fourth year are ready to be covered by a stallion are to be given. When they exceed a hundred and twenty, a she Camel in her third year is to be given for every forty and a she Camel in her fourth year for every fifty(Camels). In case the ages of the Camel vary in the payment of obligatory sadaqah(zakat) If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fifth year is payable does not possess one but possess one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him along with two goats if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fourth year is payable does not possess but possesses one in her fifth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two goats. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fourth year is payable possesses only one in her third year, that will be accepted from him.”   Abu Dawud said From here I could not retain accurately from Musa as I liked “And he must give along with it two goats if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her third year is payable possesses only one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him.”  Abu Dawud said (I was doubtful) up to here, and retained correctly onward “and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two goats. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her third year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her second year, that will be accepted from him, but he must give two goats or twenty dirhams. Anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her second year is payable does not possess one but possesses a male Camel in its third year, that will be accepted from him, and nothing extra will be demanded along with it. If anyone possesses only four Camels, no zakat will be payable on them unless their owner wishes. If the numbers of the pasturing goats reach forty to one hundred and twenty, one goat is to be given. Over one hundred and twenty up to two hundred, two goats are to be given. If they exceed two hundred reaching three hundred, three goats are to be given. If they exceed three hundred, a goat is to be for every hundred. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a male goat is not to be accepted as sadaqah (zakat) unless the collector wishes. Those which are in separate flocks are not to be brought together and those which are in one flock are not to be separated from fear of sadaqah(zakat). Regarding what belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from one another with equity, If a man’s pasturing animals are less than forty, no sadaqah(zakat) is due on them unless their owner wishes. On sliver dirhams a fortieth is payable, but if there are only a hundred and ninety, nothing is payable unless their owner wishes.”
1568 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote a letter about sadaqah (zakat) but he died before he could send it to his governors. He had kept it  with his sword. So AbuBakr acted upon it till he died, and then Umar acted upon it till he died.        It contained: "For five camels one goat is to be given; for ten camels two goats are to be given; for fifteen camels three goats are to be given; for twenty camels four goats are to be given; for twenty-five to thirty-five camels a she-camel in her second year is to be given. If the number exceeds by one up to seventy camels, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given; if they exceed by one up to seventy-five camels, a she-camel in her fifth year is to be given; if they exceed by one up to ninety camels, two she-camels in their third year are to be given; if they exceed by one up to one hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year are to be given. If the camels are more than this, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given for every fifty camels, and a she-camel in her third year is to be given for every forty camels.        For forty to one hundred and twenty goats one goat is to be given; if they exceed by one up to two hundred, two goats are to be given. If they exceed by one up to three hundred, three goats are to be given; if the goats are more than this, one goat for every hundred goats is to be given. Nothing is payable until they reach one hundred. Those which are in one flock are not to be separated, and those which are in separate flocks are not be brought together from fear of sadaqah (zakat). Regarding that which belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from each other with equity. An old goat and a defective one are not to be accepted as sadaqah (zakat)."        Az-Zuhri said: When the collector comes, the goats will be apportioned into three flocks: one containing bad, the second good, and the third moderate. The collector will take zakat from the moderate. Az-Zuhri did not mention the cows (to be apportioned in three flocks).
1569 | Therefore said tradition has also been transmitted by Sufyan bin Husain through a different chain of narrators and to the same effect. This version adds “If there is no she Camel in her second year, a she Camel in her third year is to be given.” This does not mention the words of Al Zuhri.
1570 | Ibn Shihab (Al Zuhri) said This is the copy of the letter of the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ), which he had written about sadaqah(zakat). This was in the custody of the descendants of ‘Umar bin Al Khattab. Ibn Shihab said Salim bin Abdallah bin Umar read it to me and I memorized it properly. Umar bin Abdul Aziz got it copied from ‘Abdallah, ‘Abdallah bin Umar and Salim bin ‘Abdallah bin ‘Umar. He (Ibn Shihab) then narrated the tradition like the former(i.e., up to one hundred and twenty camels). He further said if they (the camels) reach one hundred and twenty one to one hundred and twenty nine, three she camels in their third year are to be given. When they reach one hundred and thirty to one hundred and thirty nine, two she camels in their third year and one she Camel in her fourth year are to be given. When they reach one hundred and forty to one hundred and forty nine, two she camels in their fourth year and one she Camel in her third year are to be given. When they reach one hundred and fifty to one hundred and fifty nine, three she camels in their fourth year are to be given. When they reach one hundred and sixty to one hundred and sixty nine four she camels in their fourth year are to be given. When they reach one hundred and seventy to one hundred and seventy nine, three she camels in their third year and one she Camel in her fourth year are to be given. When they reach one hundred and eighty to one hundred and eighty nine, two she camels in their fourth year and two she Camel in their third year are to be given. When they reach one hundred and ninety to one hundred and ninety nine, three she camels in their fourth year and one she Camel in her third year are to be given. When they reach two hundred, four she camels in their fourth year or five she Camels in their third year, camels of whichever age are available, are to be accepted.  For the pasturing goats, he narrated the tradition similar to that transmitted by Sufyan bin Husain. This version adds “An old goat, one with  defect in the eye or a male goat is not to be accepted in sadaqah(zakat) unless the collector wishes.”
1571 | Narrated Malik:The statement of Umar bin Al Khattab “Those which are in separate flocks are not to be brought together and those which are in one flock are not to be separated” means Two persons had forty goats each ; when the collector came they brought them together in one flock so that only one goat could be given. The phrase “those which are in one flock are not to be separated” means If two partners possessed one hundred and one goats each, three goats were to be given by each of them. When the collector came they separated their goats. Thus only one goat was to be given by each of them. This is what I heard on this subject.
1572 | Al-Harith al-A'war reported from Ali. Zuhayr said:I think, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: "Pay a fortieth. A dirham is payable on every forty, but you are not liable for payment until you have accumulated two hundred dirhams. When you have two hundred dirhams, five dirhams are payable, and that proportion is applicable to larger amounts.        "Regarding sheep, for every forty sheep up to one hundred and twenty, one sheep is due. But if you possess only thirty-nine, nothing is payable on them." He further narrated the tradition about the sadaqah (zakat) on sheep like that of az-Zuhri.        "Regarding cattle, a yearling bull calf is payable for every thirty, and a cow in her third year for forty, and nothing is payable on working animals.        Regarding (the zakat on) camels, he mentioned the rates that az-Zuhri mentioned in his tradition. He said: "For twenty-five camels, five sheep are to be paid. If they exceed by one, a she-camel in her second year is to be given. If there is no she-camel in her second year, a male camel in its third year is to be given, up to thirty-five. If they exceed by one a she-camel in her third year is to be given, up to forty-five. If they exceed by one, a she-camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a bull-camel is to be given." He then transmitted the rest of the tradition like that of az-Zuhri.        He continued: If they exceed by one, i.e. they are ninety-one to hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year, which are ready to be covered by a bull-camel, are to be given. If there are more camels than that, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given for every fifty. Those which are in one flock are not to be separated, and those which are separate are not to be brought together. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a billy goat is not to be accepted as a sadaqah unless the collector is willing.        As regards agricultural produce, a tenth is payable on that which is watered by rivers or rain, and a twentieth on that which is watered by draught camels."        The version of Asim and al-Harith says: "Sadaqah (zakat) is payable every year." Zuhayr said: I think he said "Once a year".        The version of Asim has the words: "If a she-camel in her second year is not available among the camels, nor is there a bull-camel in its third year, ten dirhams or two goats are to be given."
1573 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "When you possess two hundred dirhams and one year passes on them, five dirhams are payable. Nothing is incumbent on you, that is, on gold, till it reaches twenty dinars. When you possess twenty dinars and one year passes on them, half a dinar is payable. Whatever exceeds, that will be reckoned properly."       (The narrator said: I do not remember whether the words "that will be reckoned properly" were uttered by All himself or he attributed them to the Prophet (ﷺ).       No zakat is payable on property till a year passes on it.       But Jarir said: Ibn Wahb (sub-narrator) added to this tradition from the Prophet (ﷺ): "No zakat is payable on property until a year passes away on it."
1574 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I have given exemption regarding horses and slaves; with regard to coins, however, you must pay a dirham for every forty (dirhams), but nothing is payable on one hundred and ninety. When the total reaches two hundred, five dirhams are payable.    Abu Dawud said: Al-A'mash transmitted this tradition from Abu Ishaq like the one transmitted by Abu 'Awanah. This tradition has also been narrated by Shaiban, Abu Mu'awiyah and Ibrahim b. Tahman from Abu Ishaq from al-Harith on the authority of 'Ali from the Prophet (ﷺ) to the same effect. The tradition reported by al-Nufail has also been narrated by Shu'bah, Sufyan, and others from Abu Ishaq from 'Asim from 'Ali, But they did not attribute it to the Prophet (ﷺ).
1575 | Bahz b Hakim reported from his grandfather:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: For forty pasturing camels, one she-camel in her third year is to be given. The camels are not to be separated from reckoning. He who pays zakat with the intention of getting reward will be rewarded. If anyone evades zakat, we shall take half the property from him as a due from the dues of our Lord, the Exalted. There is no share in it (zakat) of the descendants of Muhammad (ﷺ).
1576 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) sent him to the Yemen, he ordered him to take a male or a female calf a year old for every thirty cattle and a cow in its third year for every forty, and one dinar for every adult (unbeliever as a poll-tax) or cloths of equivalent value manufactured in the Yemen.
1577 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Mu’adh through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.
1578 | Narrated Mu’adh bin Jabal :that the Prophet (ﷺ) sent him to Yemen. He then narrated the tradition something similar. He did not mention in this version cloths made in the Yemen nor did he refer to adult (unbelievers).  Abu Dawud said This tradition has been transmitted by Jarir, Ya’la, Ma’mar, Abu ‘Awanahand Yahya bin Sa’id from Al A’mash, from Abu Wa’il, on the authority of Masruq, and from Ya’la and Ma’mar on the authority of Mu’adh to the same effect.
1579 | Suwayd ibn Ghaflah said:I went myself or someone who accompanied the collector of the Prophet (ﷺ) told me: It was recorded in the document written by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) not to accept a milking goat or she-camel or a (suckling) baby (as zakat on animals); and those which are in separate flocks are not to be brought together, and those which are in one flock are not to be separated.        The collector used to visit the water-hole when the sheep went there and say: Pay the sadaqah (zakat) on your property.  The narrator said: A man wanted to give him his high-humped camel (kawma').  The narrator (Hilal) asked: What is kawma', AbuSalih?  He said: A camel a high hump.        The narrator continued: He (the collector) refused to accept it. He said: I wish you could take the best of my camels. He refused to accept it. He then brought another camel lower in quality than the previous one. He refused to accept it too. He then brought another camel lower in quality than the previous one. He accepted it, saying: I shall take it, but I am afraid the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) might be angry with me, saying to me: You have purposely taken from a man a camel of your choice.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been narrated by Hushaim from Hilal bin Khabbab to the same effect. But he said: Those which are in one flock are not to be separated.
1580 | Suwaid bin Ghaflah reported The collector of the Prophet (ﷺ) came to us. I caught hold of his hand and read in the document that the goods were not to be combined nor were they to be separated for fear of zakat. There is no mention of milch animals in this tradition.
1581 | Muslim ibn Shu'bah said:Nafi' ibn Alqamah appointed my father as charge d'affaires of his tribe, and commanded him to collect sadaqah (zakat) from them. My father sent me to a group of them; so I came to an aged man called Sa'r ibn Disam        I said: My father has sent me to you to collect zakat from you.  He asked: What kind of animals will you take, my nephew?  I replied: We shall select the sheep and examine their udders.  He said: My nephew, I shall narrate a tradition to you. I lived on one of these steppes during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) along with my sheep. Two people riding a camel came to me.        They said to me: We are messengers of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), sent to you so that you may pay the sadaqah (zakat) on your sheep.        I asked: What is due from me for them?        They said: One goat. I went to a goat which I knew was full of milk and fat, and I brought it to them.        They said: This is a pregnant goat. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited us to accept a pregnant goat.        I asked: What will you take then?  They said: A goat in its second year or a goat in its third year. I then went to a goat which had not given birth to any kid, but it was going to do so. I brought it to them.        They said: Give it to us. They took it on the camel and went away.   Abu Dawud said: Abu 'Asim transmitted this tradition from Zakariyya. He said: Muslim bin Shu'bah is a narrator in the chain of this tradition as reported by the narrator Rawh.
1582 | This tradition has also been narrated by Zakariyya bin Ishaq through his chain of narrators. In this version Mulsim bin Shu'bah said:Shafi' means a goat which has a baby in its womb.       Abu Dawud said: I read in a document possessed by Abdullah ibn Salim at Hims: Abdullah ibn Mu'awiyah al-Ghadiri reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: He who performs three things will have the taste of the faith. (They are:) One who worships Allah alone and one believes that there is no god but Allah; and one who pays the zakat on his property agreeably every year. One should not give an aged animal, nor one suffering from itch or ailing, and one most condemned, but one should give animals of medium quality, for Allah did not demand from you the best of your animals, nor did He command you to give the animals of worst quality.
1583 | Narrated Ubayy ibn Ka'b:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commissioned me as a collector of zakat. I visited a man. When he had collected his property of camels, I found that a she-camel in her second year was due from him.        I said to him: Pay a she-camel in her second year, for she is to be paid as sadaqah (zakat) by you.        He said: That one is not worthy of milking and riding. Here is another she-camel which is young, grand and fat. So take it.        I said to him: I shall not take an animal for which I have not been commanded. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is here near to you. If you like, go to him, and present to him what you presented to me. Do that; if he accepts it from you, I shall accept it; if he rejects it, I shall reject it.        He said: I shall do it. He accompanied me and took with him the she-camel which he had presented to me. We came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said to him: Prophet of Allah, your messenger came to me to collect zakat on my property. By Allah, neither the Messenger of Allah nor his messenger has ever seen my property before. I gathered my property (camels), and he estimated that a she-camel in her second year would be payable by me. But that has neither milk nor is it worth riding. So I presented to him a grand young she-camel for acceptance as  zakat. But he has refused to take her. Look, she is here; I have brought her to you, Messenger of Allah. Take her.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: That is what is due from you. If you give voluntarily a better (animal) Allah will give a reward to you for it. We accept her from you.        She is here, Messenger of Allah; I have brought her to you. So take her. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then ordered me to take possession of it, and he prayed for a blessing on his property.
1584 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:said When the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) sent Mu’adh to Yemen, he said to him You are going to a people who are people of the book. So call them to bear witness that there is no diety but Allah, and that I am the Messenger of Allah. If they obey you in this respect, tell them that Allah has prescribed five prayers on them every day and night. If they obey you in this regard tell them that Allah has prescribed sadaqah(zakat) on their property and returned it to their poor. If they obey you in this respect, do not take the best of their property. Beware of the curse of the oppressed, for there is no curtain between it and Allah.
1585 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who collects more sadaqah than is due is like him who refuses to pay it.
1586 | Narrated Bashir ibn al-Khasasiyyah:      (Ibn Ubayd said in the version of his tradition that his name was not Bashir, but (it was) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (who had) named him Bashir)       We said: (to the Messenger of Allah): The collectors of sadaqah collect more than is due; can we hide our property to that proportion? He replied: "No."
1587 | The aforesaid tradition has also been narrated by Ayyub through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version adds We said Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) the collectors of sadaqah collect more than is due from us.   Abu Dawud said ‘Abd Al Razzaq narrated this tradition from Ma’mar attributing it to the Prophet(ﷺ).
1588 | Narrated Jabir ibn Atik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Riders who are objects of dislike to you will come to you, but you must welcome them when they come to you, and give them a free hand regarding what they desire. If they are just, they will receive credit for it, but if they are unjust, they will be held responsible. Please them, for the perfection of your zakat consists in their good pleasure, and let them ask a blessing for you .    Abu Dawud said: The name of the narrator Abu al-Ghusn is Thabit bin Qais bin Ghusn.
1589 | Jabir bin ‘Abdallah told of some people, meaning nomadic Arabs, who came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said Collectors of zakat come to us and act unjustly. He said please those who collect the sadaqah from you. They asked Even if they wrong us, Messenger of Allah? He replied Please those who collect sadaqah from you.   The version of ‘Uthman adds “Even if you are wronged”. Abu Kamil said in this version “Jarir said No collector of zakat returned from me since I heard this from the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ), but  he was pleased with me.”
1590 | Narrated ‘Abdallah bin Abi Awfa :My father was one of those Companions who took the oath of allegiance at the hand of the Prophet (ﷺ) beneath the tree. The Prophet (ﷺ) said when the people brought him their sadaqah : O Allah, bless the family of so and so. When my father brought him his sadaqah he said O Allah bless the family of Abu Awfa.
1591 | 'Amr bin Shu'aib, on his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:There is to be no collecting of sadaqah (zakat) from a distance, nor must people who own property remove it far away, and their sadaqahs are to be received in their dwelling.
1592 | Explaining the meaning of Jalab and janab Muhammad bin Ishaq said The meaning of jalab said is that the zakat of animals should be collected at their places (dwellings), and they (animals) should not be pulled to the collector of zakat. The meaning of janab is that the animals are removed at a distance (from the collector). The owners of the animals should do so. The collector of zakat should not stay at a distance from the places of the people who bring their animals to him. The zakat should be collected in its place.
1593 | Narrated ‘Abdallah bin Umar :‘Umar bin Al Khattab gave a horse as alms in the way of Allah. He then found it being sold, and intended to buy it. So he asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about this. He said Do not buy it, and do not take back your sadaqah.
1594 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: No sadaqah is due on a horse or a slave except that given at the breaking of the fast (at the end of Ramadan).
1595 | Narrated Abu Hurairah :The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) as saying No sadaqah is due from a Muslim on his slave or his horse.
1596 | Narrated ‘Abdallah bin Umar :The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) as saying A tenth is payable on what is watered by rain or rivers or brooks or from underground moisture and a twentieth on what is watered by draught camels.
1597 | Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdallah :The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) as saying A tenth is payable on what is watered by rivers and brooks or from underground moisture and a twentieth on what is watered by draught camels.
1598 | Waki’ said Ba’l means the agricultural crop  which grows by the rain water. Ibn Al Aswad said and Yahya, that is, Ibn Adam said I asked Abu Iyas al Asadi (about this word ba’l). He replied What is watered by rain.
1599 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent him to the Yemen, he said (to him): Collect corn from the corn, sheep from the sheep, camel from the camels, and cow from the cows.    Abu Dawud said: In Egypt I saw a cucumber thirteen spans in length and a citron cut into two pieces loaded on a camel like two loads.
1600 | 'Amr bin Shu'aib, on his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported:Hilal, a man from the tribe of Banu Mat'an brought a tenth of honey which he possessed in beehives to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He asked him (the apostle of Allah) to give the wood known as Salabah as a protected (or restricted) land.       The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave him that wood as a protected land.       When Umar ibn al-Khattab succeeded, Sufyan ibn Wahb wrote to Umar asking him about this wood. Umar ibn al-Khattab wrote to him: If he (Hilal) pays you the tithe on honey what he used to pay to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), leave the protected land of Salabah in his possession; otherwise those bees are like those of any wood; anyone can take the honey as he likes.
1601 | 'Amr bin Shu'aib, on his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported:That was Banu Shababah, a sub-clan of the tribe Fahm. The narrator then transmitted the tradition something similar. He added:(They used to pay) one bag (of honey) out of ten bags. Sufyan ibn Abdullah ath-Thaqafi gave them two woods as protected lands. They used to give as much honey (as zakat) as they gave to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He (Sufyan) used to protect their woods.
1602 | ‘Amr bin Shu’aib said on the authority of his father that his grandfather reported a sub clan of Fahm. He then narrated the tradition like that of the narrator Al Mughirah. This version has “(They used to give) sadaqah out of ten bags (of honey).” He also added “Two woods of theirs”.
1603 | Narrated Attab ibn Usayd:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded to estimate vines (for collecting zakat) as palm-trees are estimated. The zakat is to be paid in raisins as the zakat on palm trees is paid in dried dates.
1604 | The Above-mentioned tradition has also been narrated by Ibn Shihab through a different chain of narrators to the same effects.
1605 | AbdurRahman ibn Mas'ud said:Sahl ibn Abu Hathmah came to our gathering. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanding us said: When you estimate take them leaving a third, and if you do not leave or find a third, leave a quarter.
1606 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Describing the conquest of Khaybar Aisha said: The Prophet (ﷺ) used to send Abdullah ibn Rawahah to the Jews of Khaybar, and he would make an estimate of the palm trees when the fruit was in good condition before any of it was eaten.
1607 | Abu Umamah bin Sahl reported on the authority of his father:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited to accept ja'rur and habiq dates as zakat. Az-Zuhri said: These are two kinds of the dates of Medina.    Abu Dawud said: This has also been transmited by Abu al-Walid from Sulaiman bin Kathir from Az-Zuhri.
1608 | Narrated Awf ibn Malik:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered upon us in the mosque, and he had a stick in his hand. A man hung there a bunch of hashaf. He struck the bunch with the stick, and said: If the owner of this sadaqah (alms) wishes to give a better one than it, he would give. The owner of this sadaqah will eat hashaf on the Day of Judgment.
1609 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prescribed the sadaqah (alms) relating to the breaking of the fast as a purification of the fasting from empty and obscene talk and as food for the poor. If anyone pays it before the prayer (of 'Id), it will be accepted as zakat. If anyone pays it after the prayer, that will be a sadaqah like other sadaqahs (alms).
1610 | Ibn ‘Umar said :The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) commanded us that the end of Ramadan when the fasting is closed sadaqah(alms) should be paid before the people went to prayer. ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar used to pay it one or two days before.
1611 | Ibn ‘Umar said :The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) prescribed as zakat payable by slave and freeman, male and female, among the muslims on closing the fast of Ramadan one sa of dried dates or one sa’ of barley. (This tradition was read out byu ‘Abd Allah b. Maslamah to Malik)
1612 | Abd’ Allah b. Umar said :The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ)prescribed the sadaqah at the end of Ramadan one sa’. The narrator then transmitted the tradition like the one narrated by Malik. This version adds : “Young and old. He gave command that this should be paid before the people went out to prayers.”  Abu Dawud said : ‘Abd Allah al-‘Umari narrated it from Nafi’ through his chain : “on every Muslim.” The version of Sa’id al-Jumahi has : “Among the Muslims.” The well-known version transmitted by ‘Ubaid Allah does not mention the words “among the Muslims”
1613 | Ibn ‘Umar said :The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) prescribed sadaqah at the end of Ramadan one sa’ of barley and dried dates, payable by young and old freeman and slave. The version of Musa adds : “ male and female”.   Abu Dawud said : the words “male and female” narrated, by Ayyub  and ‘Abd Allah al Umar were narrated in their version on the authority of Nafi’.
1614 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The people during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to bring forth the sadaqah at the end of Ramadan when closing the fast one sa' of barley whose straw is removed, or of raisins. Abdullah said: When Umar (Allah be pleased with him) succeeded, and the wheat became abundant, Umar prescribed half a sa' of wheat instead of all these things.
1615 | Abd’ Allah(b. 'Umar) said “The people then began to pay half a sa’ of wheat later on. The narrator said :'Abd Allah (b. Umar) use to pay dried dates as sadaqah one year the people of Medina lacked dried dates, hence he paid barley.
1616 | Abu sa’id al-khudri said :When the Messenger of Allah(May peace be upon him) lived among us, we use to bring forth zakat, on closing the fast of Ramadan one sa’ of grain or of cheese, or of barley, or of dried dates, or of raisens, payable by every young and old freeman and slave. We continued to pay this till mu-awayah came to perform Haj or Umra and he spoke to the people on the pulpit. What he said to the people was : I think that Mudds of the wheat of syrria is equivalent to one sa’ of dried dates. So the people adopted it. Abu sa’id said : But I continued to pay one sa’ of wheat as long as I lived on.   Abu Dawud said : this tradition has also been transmitted by Abu sa’id through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. A man has narrated in this version from Ibn-Ulayyah one sa’ of wheat. But this version is not guarded.
1617 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Abu Sa’id through a different chain of narrators. This version adds :“Half a sa’ of wheat “. But this is a misunderstanding on the part of muawayah b. Hisham and of those who narrated from him.
1618 | Narrated Abu Sa'id al-Khudri:      I shall always pay one sa'. We used to pay during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one sa' of dried dates or of barley, or of cheese, or of raisins. This is the version of Yahya. Sufyan added in his version: "or one sa' of flour." The narrator Hamid (ibn Yahya) said: The people objected to this (addition); Sufyan then left it.     Abu Dawud said: This addition is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn Uyainah.
1619 | 'Abd Allah b. Tha'labah or Tha'labah bin 'Abd Allah bin Abu Su'air reported on his father's authority that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:One sa' of wheat is to be taken from every two, young or old, freeman or slave, male or female. Those of you who are rich will be purified by Allah, and those of you who are poor will have more than they gave returned by Him to them. Sulayman added in his version: "rich or poor"
1620 | 'Abd Allah bin Tha'labah ibn Su'ayr reported on the authority of his father:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood and gave a sermon; he commanded to give sadaqah, at the end of Ramadan when the fasting is closed, one sa' of dried dates or of barley payable by every person. The narrator Ali added in his version: "or one sa' of wheat to be taken from every two." Both the chains of narrators are then agreed upon the version: "payable by young and old, freeman and slave."
1621 | Abd Allah b. Tha’labah said (the narrator Ahmad b. salih said :He, i.e “Abd al-Razzaq, said : He is ‘Adawl. Abu Dawud said : Ahmed b. Salih said : He is ‘Adhri): The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) delivered a speech before the closing fast (‘Id) by two days. He then transmitted the tradition like that of al Muqri (‘Abd Allah b. Yazid).
1622 | Al-Hasan said:Ibn Abbas preached towards the end of Ramadan on the pulpit (in the mosque) of al-Basrah. He said: Bring forth the sadaqah relating to your fast. The people, as it were, could not understand. Which of the people of Medina are present here? Stand for your brethren, and teach them, for they do not know.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prescribed this sadaqah as one sa' of dried dates or barley, or half a sa' of wheat payable by every freeman or slave, male or female, young or old. When Ali came (to Basrah), he found that price had come down. He said: Allah has given prosperity to you, so give one sa' of everything (as sadaqah).       The narrator Humayd said: Al-Hasan maintained that the sadaqah at the end of Ramadan was due on a person who fasted.
1623 | Abu Hurairah said :The Prophet(ﷺ) sent Umar b. al-Khattab to collect sadaqa (All the people paid the zakat but ibn-jamil, Khalid b. al-walid and al-abbas refused. So the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said : Ibn-jamil is not (so much) objecting, but he was poor and Allah enriched him. As for Khalid b. Walid, you are wronging him, for he has kept back his courts of mail and weapons to use them in Allah’s path. As for al-Abbas, the uncle of the Messenger of Allah(May peace be upon him), I shall be responsible for it and an equal amount along with it. Then he said did you not know(Umar) that a man’s paternal uncle is of the same stock as the father or his father?
1624 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      Al-Abbas asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about paying the sadaqah (his zakat) in advance before it became due, and he gave permission to do that.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by Hushaim through a different chain of narrators. The version of Hushaim is more sound.
1625 | Ibrahim ibn Ata, the client of Imran ibn Husayn, reported on the authority of his father:Ziyad, or some other governor, sent Imran ibn Husayn to collect sadaqah (i.e. zakat). When he returned, he asked Imran: Where is the property? He replied: Did you send me to bring the property? We collected it from where we used to collect in the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and we spent it where we used to spend during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
1626 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who begs (from people) when he is affluent will come on the Day of Resurrection with scrapes, scratchings, or lacerations on his face. He was asked: What constitutes affluence, Messenger of Allah? He replied:It is fifty dirhams or its value in gold.   The narrator Yahya said: Abdullah ibn Sufyan said to Sufyan: I remember that Shu'bah does not narrate from Hakim ibn Jubayr. Sufyan said: Zubayr transmitted to us this tradition from Muhammad ibn AbdurRahman ibn Yazid.
1627 | ‘Ata’ b. Yasar said :A man from Banu Asad said : I and my family alighted at Baqi al-Gharqad. My wife said to me : Go the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) and beg something from him for our eating, and made a mention of there need. So I went to the Messenger of Allah(May peace be upon him). I found with a man who was begging from him and he was saying to him: I have nothing to give you. The man turned away from him in anger while he was saying: By my life, you give anyone you wish. The Messenger of Allah(May peace be upon him) said : He’s anger with me, for I have nothing to give him. If any of you begs when he has an Uqiyah or its equivalent, he has begged immoderately. The man of Banu Asad said : So I said : The she camel of ours is better than an uqiyah, while an uqiyah is equivalent to 40 Dirhams. I therefore returned and did not beg from him. Afterwards some barley and raisins where brought to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him). He gave us a share from them (or as he reported)till Allah, the Exalted, made us self-sufficient(i.e well off).   Abu Dawud said: Al-Thawri narrated it as Malik narrated.
1628 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone begs when he has something equivalent to an uqiyah in value, he has begged immoderately. So I said: My she-camel, Yaqutah, is better than an uqiyah. The version of Hisham goes: "better than forty dirhams. So I returned and did not beg anything from him." Hisham added in his version: "An uqiyah during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was equivalent to forty dirhams."
1629 | Narrated Sahl ibn Hanzaliyyah:      Uyaynah ibn Hisn and Aqra' ibn Habis came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). They begged from him. He commanded to give them what they begged. He ordered Mu'awiyah to write a document to give what they begged. Aqra' took his document, wrapped it in his turban, and went away.        As for Uyaynah, he took his document and came to the Prophet (ﷺ) at his home, and said to him: Muhammad, do you see me? I am taking a document to my people, but I do not know what it contains, just like the document of al-Mutalammis. Mu'awiyah informed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) of his statement.        Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who begs (from people) when he has sufficient is simply asking for a large amount of Hell-fire. (An-Nufayl (a transmitter) said elsewhere: "embers of Hell".)        They asked: Messenger of Allah, what is a sufficiency? (Elsewhere an-Nufayl said: What is a sufficiency which makes begging unfitting?)        He replied: It is that which would provide a morning and an evening meal. (Elsewhere an-Nufayl said: It is when one has enough for a day and night, or for a night and a day.) He (an-Nufayl) narrated to us this tradition briefly in the words that I have mentioned.
1630 | Narrated Ziyad ibn al-Harith as-Suda'i:      I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and swore allegiance to him, and after telling a long story he said: Then a man came to him and said: Give me some of the sadaqah (alms). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah is not pleased with a Prophet's or anyone else's decision about sadaqat till He has given a decision about them Himself. He has divided those entitled to them into eight categories, so if you come within those categories, I shall give you what you desire.
1631 | Abu Hurairah reported Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :The poor man(miskin) is not one who is admitted (by the people) with one or two dates or with one or two morsels but is one, who does not beg anything from his people and is not taken notice of so that alms may be given to him.
1632 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said something similar as mentioned in the preceding tradition. This version adds: But the poor man (miskin) who abstains from begging from the people is one (according to the version of Musaddad who does not get enough so that he may not beg from the people, nor is his need known to the people, so that alms be given to him. This is the one who has been deprived. Musaddad did not mention the words "one who avoids begging from the people."    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Muhammad bin Thawr and 'Abd al-Razzaq on the authority of Ma'mar. They mentioned that the word "deprived" is the statement of al-Zuhri, and this is more sound.
1633 | Narrated Ubaydullah ibn Adl ibn al-Khiyar:      Two men informed me that they went to the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was at the Farewell Pilgrimage while he was distributing the sadaqah and asked him for some of it. He looked us up and down, and seeing that we were robust, he said: If you wish, I shall give you something, but there is nothing spare in it for a rich man or for one who is strong and able to earn a living.
1634 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr :      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Sadaqah may not be given to a rich man or to one who has strength and is sound in limbs.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Sufyan from Sa'd bin Ibrahim like the tradition narrated by Ibrahim. The version of Shu'bah from Sa'd has: "for a man who has strength and is robust." The other version of this tradition from the Prophet (ﷺ) have the words "for a man who has strength and is robust." Others have "for a man who has strength and is sound in limbs." 'Ata bin Zuhair said that he had met 'Abd Allah bin 'Amr who said: "Sadaqah is not lawful for a strong man nor for a man who has strength and is sound in limbs."
1635 | Narrated Ata ibn Yasar:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Sadaqah may not be given to rich man, with the exception of five classes: One who fights in Allah's path, or who collects it, or a debtor, or a man who buys it with his money, or a man who has a poor neighbour who has been given sadaqah and gives a present to the rich man.
1636 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by abu-Said al-Khudri to the same effect to a different chain of narrators, attributing it to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him).   Abu-Dawud said :Ibn ‘Uyainah reported from Zaid, from whom Malik narrated and Thwari narrated from Zaid that an authentic narrator reported from the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him)
1637 | Abu-Said reported :Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said : Sadaqah is not lawful for a rich person except  what comes as a result of Jihad or what a poor neighbor gifts you out of the sadaqah given to him, or he entertains you in a feast.   Abu-Dawud said : This has been transmitted by Abu- Said through a different chain of narrators in a similar way.
1638 | Basheer b. Yasar said that a man from the Ansar called Sahi b. abu-Hatmah told him that Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) gave one Hundred camels to him a blood-wit from among the camels of sadaqah, i.e a blood-wit for the Ansari who was killed at Khaibar.
1639 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Acts of begging are lacerations with which a man disfigures his face, so he who wishes may preserve his self-respect, and he who wishes may abandon it; but this does not apply to one who begs from a ruler, or in a situation which makes it necessary.
1640 | Qabisah b. Mukhiriq al-Hilali said :I became a guarantor for a payment, and I came to Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him).  He said: Wait till I receive the sadaqah and I shall order it to be given to you.  He then said : Begging, Qabisah, is allowable only to one of three classes: a man who has become a guarantor for a payment to whom begging is allowed till he gets it, after which he must stop (begging); a man who has been stricken by a calamity and it destroys his property to whom begging is allowed till he gets what will support life (or he said, what will provide a reasonable subsistence); and a man who has been smitten by poverty, about whom three intelligent members of his people confirm by saying: So and so has been smitten by poverty, to such a person begging is allowed till be gets what will support life (or he said, what will provide a reasonable subsistence), after which he must stop (begging).  Any other reason for begging, Qabisah, is forbidden, and one who engages in such consumes it as a thing which is forbidden.
1641 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      A man of the Ansar came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and begged from him.        He (the Prophet) asked: Have you nothing in your house?  He replied: Yes, a piece of cloth, a part of which we wear and a part of which we spread (on the ground), and a wooden bowl from which we drink water.        He said: Bring them to me. He then brought these articles to him and he (the Prophet) took them in his hands and asked: Who will buy these?  A man said: I shall buy them for one dirham.  He said twice or thrice: Who will offer more than one dirham?  A man said: I shall buy them for two dirhams.        He gave these to him and took the two dirhams and, giving them to the Ansari, he said: Buy food with one of them and hand it to your family, and buy an axe and bring it to me. He then brought it to him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fixed a handle on it with his own hands and said: Go, gather firewood and sell it, and do not let me see you for a fortnight. The man went away and gathered firewood and sold it. When he had earned ten dirhams, he came to him and bought a garment with some of them and food with the others.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: This is better for you than that begging should come as a spot on your face on the Day of Judgment. Begging is right only for three people: one who is in grinding poverty, one who is seriously in debt, or one who is responsible for compensation and finds it difficult to pay.
1642 | Awf b. Malik said :We were with Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him), seven or eight or nine.  He said : Do you take the oath of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him), and we shortly took the oath of allegiance.  We said: we have already taken the oath of allegiance to you.  He repeated the same words three times.  We then stretched our hands and took the oath of allegiance to him.  A man (or us) said : We took the oath of allegiance to you; now on what should we take the oath of allegiance, Messenger of Allah ?  He replied: That you should worship Allah, do not associate anything with Him, offer five times prayer, listen and obey.  He uttered a word quietly  : And do not beg from the people.  When the whip fell on the ground, none of that group asked anyone to pick up the whip for him.   Abu Dawud said : The version of Hisham was not narrated by anyone except Sa'id.
1643 | Thawban, the client of the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him), reported him as saying :If anyone guarantees me that he will not beg from people, I will guarantee him Paradise.  Thawban said : I (will not beg).  He never asked anyone for anything.

No one has been given a more ample gift than endurance.

The narrator `Abd al-Warith said in his version : `The upper hand is the one which abstains from begging;” but most of the narrators have narrated from Hammad b. Zaid from Ayyub the words “ The upper hand is the one which bestows.” A narrator from Hammad said in his version  “the one which abstains from begging.”

If any owner does not pay zakat on them, the sheep wilkl appear on the Day or Judgment most strong and in great number, a soft sandy plain will be spread out for them ; they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs; there will be none of them with twisted horns or without horns.  As often as the last of them passes him, the first of them will be brought back to him, until Allah pronounces His Judgment among mankind during a day whose extent will be fifty thousand years that you count, and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. If any owner of camels does not pay what is due on them, they  will appear in  on the Day or Judgment most strong and in great number, a soft sandy plain will be spread out for them ; they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs; there will be none of them with twisted horns or without horns.

We thought that none of us had a right in surplus property.
1664 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      When this verse was revealed: "And those who hoard gold and silver," the Muslims were grieved about it. Umar said: I shall dispel your care. He, therefore, went and said: Prophet of Allah, your Companions were grieved by this verse. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah has made zakat obligatory simply to purify your remaining property, and He made inheritances obligatory that they might come to those who survive you. Umar then said: Allah is most great. He then said to him: Let me inform you about the best a man hoards; it is a virtuous woman who pleases him when he looks at her, obeys him when he gives her a command, and guards his interests when he is away from her.

But he (the Prophet) turned his attention from him. He then came to him from his left side and repeated the same words. But he (again) turned his attention from him. He then came to him from behind. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took it and threw it away. Had it hit him, it would have hurt him or wounded him.

The best sadaqah is that which leaves a competence.

We could not reach fifteen characteristics.

1686 | Sa’d said When the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) took the oath of allegiance from woman, a woman of high rank, who seemed to be one of the women of Mudar, rose and said Prophet of Allah (SWAS), we are dependant on our parents, our sons.  (Abu Dawud said I think (this version) has the word “ and our husbands”. )  So what part of their property can be spent lawfully?  He said Fresh food which you eat and give as a present.

Thus both of them (Abu Talhah and Hassan) have their common link in Haram who is the third great grandfather. Ubbay bin Ka’b is son of Qais bin ‘Atik bin Zaid bin Mu’awiyah bin ‘Amr bin Malik bin al-Najjar.  Thus the common tie between Hassan, Abu Talhah and Ubbay is ‘Amr (bin Malik). The Ansari said between Ubbay and Abi Talhah there are six great grandfathers.

1698 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) preached and said: Abstain from avarice, for those who had been before you were annihilated due to avarice.

He said: I found a purse which contained one hundred dinars; so I came to the Prophet (ﷺ). He said to me: Make the matter known for a year. I made it known for a year and then came to him. He then said to me: Make the matter known for a year. So I made it known for a year. I then (again) came to him. He said to me: Make the matter known for a year. Then I came to him and said: I did not find anyone who realises it. He said: Remember, its number, its container and its tie. If its owner comes, (give it to him), otherwise use it yourself.       He (the narrator Shu'bah) said: I do not know whether he said the word "make the matter known" three times or once.

1704 | Zaid bin Khalid al-Juhani said :A man asked the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) about a find.  	He said: Make the matter known for a year, then note its string and its container and then use it for your purpose.  Then if its owner comes, give it to him.  He asked : Messenger of Allah, what about a stray sheep?  He replied:  Take it; that is for you, or for your brother, or for the wolf.  He again asked: Messenger of Allah, What about stray camels?  The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) became angry so much so that his cheeks became red or ( the narrator is doubtful) his face became red.  He replied: What have you to do with them?  They have with them their feet and their stomachs (for drink) till their master comes to him.
1705 | The above mentioned tradition has also been transmitted by Malik through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.

This version adds; if its seeker comes, and recognizes its container and its number, then give it to him.  Hammad also narrated it from `Ubaid Allah bin `Umar from `Amr bin Shu’aib, from his father, from his grandfather, from the Prophet (SWAS) something similar.     Abu Dawud said :This addition made by Hammad bin Salamah bin Kuhail, Yahya bin Sa’id, `Ubaid Allah bin `Umar and Rabi’ah; “if its owner comes and recognizes its container, and its string,” is not guarded.

Regarding stray camels and sheep he mentioned the same as others have done. He said: He was asked about finds and replied: If it is in a frequented road and a large town, make the matter known for a year, and if its owner comes, give it to him, but if he does not, it belongs to you. If it is in a place which has been a waste from ancient time, or if it is a hidden treasure (belonging to the Islamic period), it is subject to the payment of the fifth.

She replied: Due to hunger.  ‘Ali went out and found a dinar in the market.  He then came to Fatima and told her about it.  She said:  Go to such and such a Jew and get some flour for us.  He came to the Jew and purchased flour with it.  He said : Are you the son-in-law of him who believes that he is the Messenger of Allah.  He said : Yes.  The Jew said : Have your dinar with you and you will get the flour.  Ali then went out and came to Fatima.  He told her about the matter.  She then said: Go to such and such a butcher and get some meat for us for a dirham.  Ali went out and pawned the dinar for a dirham with him and got the meat, and brought it (to her).  She then kneaded the flour, put the utensil on fire and baked the bread.  She sent for her father : (i.e. the Prophet (SWAS).  He came to them.  She said to him : Messenger of Allah, I tell you all the matter.  If you think it is lawful for us, we shall eat it and you will eat with us.  She said: The matter is such and such.  He said: eat in the name of Allah.  So they ate it.  While they were (eating) at their place, a boy cried adguring in the name of Allah and Islam: He was searching the dinar.  The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) commanded and he was called in.  He asked him.  The boy replied, I lost it somewhere in the market.  The Prophet (SWAS) said : `Ali, go to the butcher and tell him that the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) has asked you : send the dinar to me and one dirham of yours will be due on me.  The butcher returned it and the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) handed it to him (the boy).

1720 | Narrated Al-Mundhir ibn Jarir:      I accompanied Jarir at Bawazij. The shepherd brought the cows. Among them there was a cow that was not one of them. Jarir asked him: What is this? He replied: This was mixed with the cows and we do not know to whom it belongs. Jarir said: Take it out. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: No one mixes a stray animal (with his animals) but a man who strays from right path.
1721 | Narrated Aqra' ibn Habib:      Ibn Abbas said: Aqra' ibn Habis asked the Prophet (ﷺ) saying: Messenger of Allah hajj is to be performed annually or only once? He replied: Only once, and if anyone performs it more often, he performs a supererogatory act.   Abu Dawud said: The narrator Abu Sinan is Abu Sinan al-Du'wail. The same has been reported by both 'Abd al-Jalil bin Humaid and Sulaiman bin Kathir from al-Zuhri. The narrator 'Uqail reported the name "Sinan".
1722 | Narrated Abu Waqid al-Laythi:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying to his wives during the Farewell Pilgrimage: This (is the pilgrimage for you); afterwards stick to the surface of the mats (i.e. should stay at home).

He then narrated the rest of the tradition to the same effect (as above).     The narrator al-Nufaili said : Malik narrated us.     Abu Dawud said : The narrators al-Nufail and al_Qa’nabi did not mention the words “from his father”.     Ibn Wahb and ‘Uthman bin ‘Umr narrated from Malik the same words as narrated by al-Qa’nabi (i.e. omitted the words “from his father”).
1725 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) as saying :He then reported the same tradition as mentioned above but he mentioned (in this version) the word “mail post”.
1726 | Abu Sa’id reported The Apostel of Allah (SWAS) as saying:A woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day must not make a journey of more than three days unless she is accompanied by her father or her brother, or her husband or her son or her relative who is within the prohibited degree.
1727 | Ibn `Umr reported the Prophet (SWAS) as saying :A woman must not make a journey of three days unless she is accompanied by a man who is within the prohibited degree.
1728 | Nafi` said :Ibn `Umr used to seat his slave girl called Safiyyah behind him(on the Camel) and thus she travelled to Makkah in his company.
1729 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Islam does not allow for failure to perform the hajj.
1730 | Ibn `Abbas said :People used to perform Hajj and not bring provisions with them.  Abu Mas’ud said the inhabitants of Yemen or people of Yemen used to perform Hajj and not bring provisions with them.  They would declare we put our trust in Allah.  So Allah most high sent down “ and bring provisions, but the best provision is piety”.
1731 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Ibn Abbas recited this verse: 'It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your Lord', and said: The people would not trade in Mina (during the hajj), so they were commanded to trade when they proceeded from Arafat.
1732 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who intends to perform hajj should hasten to do so.
1733 | AbuUmamah at-Taymi said:I was a man who used to give (riding-beasts) on hire for this purpose (for travelling during the pilgrimage) and the people would tell (me): Your hajj is not valid. So I met Ibn Umar and told him: AbuAbdurRahman, I am a man who gives (riding-beast) on hire for this purpose (i.e. for hajj), and the people tell me: Your hajj is not valid. Ibn Umar replied: Do you not put on ihram (the pilgrim dress), call the talbiyah (labbayk), circumambulate the Ka'bah, return from Arafat and lapidate jamrahs? I said: Why not? Then he said: Your hajj is valid. a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked him the same question you have asked me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kept silence and did not answer him till this verse came down: "It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your Lord." The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent for him and recited this verse to him and said: Your hajj is valid.
1734 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The people used to trade, in the beginning, at Mina, Arafat, the market place of Dhul-Majaz, and during the season of hajj. But (later on) they became afraid of trading while they were putting on ihram. So Allah, glory be to Him, sent down this verse: "It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your Lord during the seasons of hajj." Ubayd ibn Umayr told me that he (Ibn Abbas) used to recite this verse in his codex.
1735 | `Abd Allah bin `Abbas said :In the beginning when Hajj was prescribed, people used to trade during Hajj.  The narrator then narrated the rest of the tradition upto the words, `season of Hajj’.
1736 | Ibn `Abbas said the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) was at al-Rawha.  There he met some riders. He saluted them and asked who they were.  They replied that they were Muslims.  They asked who are you.  They (the companions) replied he is the Messenger of Allah (SWAS).  A woman became upset :she took her child by his arm and lifted him from her litter at the camel. She said Messenger of Allah (SWAS) can this (child) be credited with having performed Hajj.  He replied Yes, and you will have a reward.
1737 | Ibn Umar said :The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) appointed the following places for putting on Ihram : Dhul al-Hulaifah for the people of Madina, al-Juhfah for the people of Syria and al-Qarn for the people of Najd and have been told that appointed Yalamlam for the people of Yemen.
1738 | Ibn `Abbas and Tawus reported :The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) appointed places for putting on Ihram and narrated the rest of the tradition to the same effect (as mentioned above).     One of them said and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen.  The other narrator said Alamlam.  These (places for Ihram) are appointed for these regions and for people of other regions who come to them intending to perform Hajj and `Umrah.  The place where those who live nearer to Makkah should put on Ihram from where they start and so on up to the inhabitants of Makkah itself who put on Ihram in it. This is the version of Ibn Tawus.
1739 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) appointed Dhat Irq as the place for putting on ihram for the people of Iraq.

The narrator Abdullah doubted which of these words he said.   Abu Dawud said: May Allah have mercy on Waki'. He put on ihram from Jerusalem (Aqsa mosque), that is, to Mecca.
1742 | Narrated Al-Harith ibn Amr as-Sahmi:      I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he was at Mina, or at Arafat. He was surrounded by the people. When the bedouins came and saw his face, they would say: This is a blessed face. He said: He (the Prophet) appointed Dhat Irq as the place of putting on ihram for the people of Iraq.
1743 | 'Aishah said:Asma daughther of 'Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abi Bakr at Shajarah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded Abu Bakr to ask her to take a bath and wear ihram.

Abu Ma'mar said in his version: "till she is purified". The narrator Ibn Isa did not mention the names of Ikrimah and Mujahid, but he said: from Ata on the authority of Ibn Abbas. Ibn Isa also did not mention the word "all (rites of hajj)." He said in his version: All the rites of hajj except circumambulation of the House (the Ka'bah).
1745 | `A’ishah said ; I used to perfume the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) preparatory to his entering the sacred state before he put on Ihram, and preparatory to putting off Ihram before he made the circuits round the House (the Ka’bah).
1746 | `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said :I still seem to see the glistening of the perfume where the hair was parted on the head of the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) while he was wearing Ihram.

1749 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      In the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) included among his sacrificial animals a camel with a silver nose-ring (Ibn Minhal's version has gold) which had belonged to AbuJahl (the version of an-Nufayli added) "thereby enraging the polytheists".
1750 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sacrificed a cow for his wives at the Farewell Pilgrimage.
1751 | Narrated Abu Hurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sacrificed a cow for his wives who had performed umrah.
1752 | Ibn `Abbas said :The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) offered the noon prayer at Dhu al-Hulaifah.  He then sent for a camel and made incision in the right side of its hump ; he then took out the blood by pressing it and tied two shoes in its neck.  He then rode on his mount (camel) and reached al-Baida, he raised his voice for the talbiyah for performing Hajj.
1753 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Shu’bah through a different chain of narrators similar to that reported by Abu al-Walid.  This version adds he then took out the blood by pressing it with his hand.  	   Abu Dawud said :Hammam’s version has the words “He took out the blood by pressing with his fingers”.   Abu Dawud said this tradition has been narrated by the people of Basrah who alone are its transmitters.
1754 | Al-Miswar bin Makhramah and al-Marwan said the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) proceeded in the year of al-Hudaibiyyah (to Makkah).  When he reached Dhu al-Hulaifah, he tied (garlanded) something in the neck of the sacrificial camel (which He took along with him), and made incision in its hump and put on Ihram.
1755 | Ai’shah said :The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) once brought sheep (or goats) for sacrifice to the house (at the Ka’bah) and garlanded them.
1756 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Umar ibn al-Khattab named a bukhti camel for sacrifice (at hajj). He was offered three hundred dinars for it (as its price). He came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, I named a bukhti camel for sacrifice and I was offered for it three hundred dinars. May I sell it and purchase another one for its price? No, sacrifice it.   Abu Dawud said: This was due to the fact that 'Umar had made an incision in hump.
1757 | Ai’shah said :I twisted the garlands of the sacrificial animals of the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) with my own hands, after which he made incision in their humps and garlanded them, and sent them as offerings to the house (Kabah), but he himself stayed back at Madinah and nothing which had been lawful for him had been forbidden.
1758 | Ai’shah said:The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) would send the sacrificial animals as offerings (to Makkah) from Madinah.  I would twist the garlands of the sacrificial animals ; thereafter he would not abstain from anything  from which a pilgrim putting on Ihram abstains.
1759 | Ai’shah said:The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) sent sacrificial camels as offering (to the Ka’bah) and I twisted with my own hands their garlands of coloured wool that we had with us.  Next morning he came free from restrictions, having intercourse (with his wife) as a man not wearing Ihram does with his wife.
1760 | Abu Hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (SWAS)saw a man driving the sacrificial camel. He said ride on it.  He said this is a sacrificial camel.  He again said ride on it, bother you, either the second or the third time he spoke.
1761 | Abu al-Zubair said:I asked Jabir bin `Abdallah about riding on the sacrificial camels.  He said I heard  The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) saying ride on them gently when you have nothing else till you find a mount.
1762 | Narrated Najiyah al-Aslami:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent sacrificial camels with him (as offering to the Ka'bah). He then said: If any one of them becomes fatigued, slaughter it, dip its shoes in its blood, and leave it for the people (to eat).
1763 | Ibn Abbas said:The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) sent a man of al-Aslam tribe and sent with him eighteen sacrificial camels (as offering to Makkah).  What do you think if any one of them becomes fatigued.  He replied : You should sacrifice it then dye its shoe with its blood, then mark with it on its neck.  But you or any of your companions should not eat out of it.     Abu Dawud said: The following words of this tradition are not supported by any other tradition “You should not eat of it yourself nor any of your companions”.   The version of `Abdal Warith has the words “then hang it in its neck” instead of the words “mark or strike with it”.  Abu Dawud said I heard Abu Salamah say if the chain of narrators and the meaning are correct, it is sufficient for you.
1764 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sacrificed the camels, he sacrificed thirty of them with his own hand, and then commanded me (to sacrifice them), so I sacrificed the rest of them.
1765 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Qurt:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The greatest day in Allah's sight is the day of sacrifice and next the day of resting which Isa said on the authority of Thawr is the second day. Five or six sacrificial camels were brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and they began to draw near to see which he would sacrifice first. When they fell down dead, he said something in a low voice, which I could not catch. So I asked: What did he say? He was told that he had said: Anyone who wants can cut off a piece.
1766 | Narrated Arfah ibn al-Harith al-Kandi:      I was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the Farewell Pilgrimage. When the sacrificial camels were brought to him, he said: Call AbulHasan (Ali) to me. Ali was then called for and he (the Prophet) said to him: Catch hold of the lower end of the lance, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) himself caught hold of the upper end. He then pierced the camels with it. When he finished slaughtering, he rode on his mule and mounted Ali behind him.
1767 | `Abd al Rahman bin Thabit said:The Prophet (SWAS) and his companions used to sacrifice the camel with its left leg tied and it remained standing on the rest of his legs.
1768 | Ziyad bin Jubair said :I was present with Ibn `Umar at Minah.  He passed a man who was sacrificing his camel while it was sitting.  He said make it stand and tie its leg ; thus follow the practice (sunnah) of Muhammad (SWAS).
1769 | `Ali said :The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) commanded me to take charge of (his) sacrificial camels and to distribute the skins and saddle clothes (after sacrifice) as sadaqah.  He commanded me not to give anything from it to the butcher.  He said we used to give it (the wages) to the butcher ourselves.
1770 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Sa'id ibn Jubayr said: I said to Abdullah ibn Abbas: AbulAbbas, I am surprised to see the difference of opinion amongst the companions of the Apostle (ﷺ) about the wearing of ihram by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he made it obligatory.        He replied: I am aware of it more than the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed only one hajj. Hence the people differed among themselves. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out (from Medina) with the intention of performing hajj. When he offered two rak'ahs of prayer in the mosque at Dhul-Hulayfah, he made it obligatory by wearing it.        At the same meeting, he raised his voice in the talbiyah for hajj, when he finished his two rak'ahs. Some people heard it and I retained it from him. He then rode (on the she-camel), and when it (the she-camel) stood up, with him on its back, he raised his voice in the talbiyah and some people heard it at that moment. This is because the people were coming in groups, so they heard him raising his voice calling the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and they thought that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) proceeded further; when he ascended the height of al-Bayda' he raised his voice in the talbiyah. Some people heard it at that moment. They thought that he had raised his voice in the talbiyah when he ascended the height of al-Bayda'. I swear by Allah, he raised his voice in the talbiyah at the place where he prayed, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when he ascended the height of al-Bayda'.        Sa'id (ibn Jubayr) said; He who follows the view of Ibn Abbas raises his voice in talbiyah (and ihram) at the place of is prayer after he finishes two rak'ahs of his prayer.
1771 | Ibn `Umar said this is your al-Baida’ about which you ascribe falsehood to the Messenger of Allah (SWAS). He did not raise his voice in talbiyah but from the masjid, i.e.  the mosque of Dhu al-Hulaifah.
1772 | Ubayd ibn Jurayj said to Abdullah ibn Umar:AbuAbdurRahman, I saw you doing things which I did not see being done by your companions.        He asked: What are they, Ibn Jurayj?  He replied: I saw you touching only the two Yamani corners; and I saw you wearing shoes having no hair; I saw you dyeing in yellow colour; and I saw you wearing ihram on the eighth of Dhul-Hijjah, whereas the people had worn ihram when they sighted the moon.        Abdullah ibn Umar replied: As regards the corners, I have not seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) touching anything (in the Ka'bah) but the two Yamani corners. As for the tanned leather shoes, I have seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wearing tanned leather shoes, and he would wear them after ablution. Therefore I like to wear them. As regards wearing yellow, I have seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wearing yellow, so I like to wear with it. As regards shouting the talbiyah, I have seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raising his voice in talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back.
1773 | Anas said :Messenger of Allah (SWAS) prayed four rak’ahs at Madinah and prayed two rak’ahs of afternoon prayer at Dhu-al Hulaifah.  He then passed the night at Dhu-al Hulaifah till the morning came.  When he rode on his mount and it stood up on its back, he raised his voice in talbiyah.
1774 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the noon prayer, and then rode on his mount. When he came to the hill of al-Bayda', he raised his voice in talbiyah.
1775 | Narrated Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas:      When the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him0 undertook his journey by the way of al-Far', he shouted talbiyah when his mount stood up with him on its back. But when he travelled by the way of Uhud, he raised his voice in Talbiyah when he ascended the hill of al-Bayda'.
1776 | Ibn `Abbas said:Duba`ah, daughter of al-Zubair bin `Abd al-Muttalib, came to the Messenger of Allah(SWAS) and said Messenger of Allah (SWAS) I want to perform Hajj; may I make a provision?  He said Yes. She asked how should I say?  He replied : Say “ Labbaik Allahumma Labbaik (I am at Thy service, Oh Allah, I am at Thy service).  The place where I took off Ihram will be where Thou restrainest me.”
1777 | Ai’shah said :The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) performed Hajj exclusively (without performing `Umrah in the beginning).
1778 | Ai’shah said :We went out along with  The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) when the moon of the month of Dhu al-Hijja was going to appear shortly.  When he reached Dhu al-Hulaifah he said : Anyone who wants to perform Hajj should raise his voice in Talbiyah for Hajj (after wearing Ihram); and he who wants to perform `Umrah should raise his voice in talbiyah for an `Umrah.  The narrator Musa in the version of Wuhaib reported him (the Prophet) as saying if there were no sacrificial animals with me, I would raise my voice in talbiyah for an `Umrah.  But according to the version of Hammad bin Salamah, he said as for myself, I shall raise my voice in talbiyah for Hajj because I have sacrificial animal with me.  The agreed version goes I (Ai’shah) was one of those persons who wore Ihram for an ‘Umrah.  But on my way (to Makkah) I menstruated.  The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) entered upon me while I was weeping.  He asked why are you weeping?  I wished I would not come out (for Hajj) this year.  He said give up your `Umrah; untie your hair and comb.  The version of Musa said and raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj (after wearing Ihram).  Sulaiman’s version goes and do as all the Muslims do during their Hajj.  When the night for performing the obligatory circumambulation (tawaf al-Ziyarah) came, the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) commanded `Abd al-Rahman.  He took her to al-Tan’im (instead of the words “her ‘Umrah”).  She went round the Ka’bah.  Allah thus completed both her ‘Umrah and Hajj.    Hisham said : No sacrificial animal was offered during all this time.     In the version of Hammad bin Salamah, the narrator Musa added when the night of al-Batha came Ai’ shah was purified.
1779 | Ai’shah wife the Prophet (SWAS) narrated we went out with the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) at the farewell pilgrimage.  Some of us had put on Ihram for `Umrah and some both for Hajj and `Umrah, when the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) had put on Ihram for Hajj only.He who had put on Ihram for 'Umrah, put off Ihram after performing `Umrah and he who had worn Ihram both for Hajj and `Umrah or only for Hajj did not take it off till the tenth (of the month).
1780 | The aforesaid tradition has also been narrated by Abu al-Aswad through a different chain of narrators. This version adds he who raises his voice in talbiyah for `Umrah (and wearing Ihram for it) should put off Ihram after performing `Umrah.
1781 | Ai’shah the wife of the Prophet (SWAS) said :We went out with the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) at the farewell pilgrimage and raised the voice in talbiyah for an ‘Umrah.  The Apostel of Allah (SWAS) said those who have brought the sacrificial animals with them should raise their voices in talbiyah for Hajj along with an ‘Umrah and they should not put off their Ihram till they do so after performing them both.  I came to Makkah while I was menstruating and I did not go round the House (the Ka’bah) or run between al-Safa and al-Marwah. I complained about this to the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) he said: Undo your hair, comb it and raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj and let `Umrah go.  She said I did so.  When we performed Hajj, the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) sent me along with `Abd al-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to al-Ta’nim and I performed `Umrah.  He said, this is `Umrah in place of the one you had missed.  She said those who had raised their voices in talbiyah for `Umrah put off Ihram after circumambulating the House (the Ka’bah) and after running between al-Safa and al-Marwa.  Then they performed another circumambulation for their Hajj after they returned from Mina but those who combined Hajj and `Umrah performed only one circumambulation.
1782 | Ai’shah said :We raised our voices in talbiyah for Hajj.  When we reached Sarif, I menstruated.  The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) came upon me while I was weeping.  He asked, why are your weeping, Ai’shah?  I replied, I menstruated.  Would that I had not come out for performing Hajj.  He said : Glory be to Allah, this is a thing prescribed by Allah on the daughters of Adam.  He said perform all the rites of Hajj but do not go round the House (the Ka’bah).  When we entered Makkah, the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) said he who desires to make (his Hajj) an `Umrah may do so, except those who have sacrificial animals with them. The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) sacrificed a cow on behalf of his wives on the day of sacrifice.  When the night of al-Batha came, and Ai’shah was purified she said to the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) my fellow female pilgrims will return after performing Hajj and `Umrah and I shall return after performing only Hajj?  He therefore, ordered `Abd al-Rahman bin Abu Bakr who took her to al-Ta’nim.  She uttered there talbiyah for `Umrah.
1783 | A’ishah said “We went out with the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) and we thought it nothing but a Hajj. When we came, we circumambulated the House (the Ka’bah). The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) then commanded those who did not bring the sacrificial animals with them to take off their ihram. Therefore those who did not bring the sacrificial animals with them took off their ihram.
1784 | A’ishah reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “If I had known beforehand about my affair what I have come to know later, I would not have brought the sacrificial animals with me. The narrator Muhammad(bin Yahya) said “ I think he(’Uthman bin ‘Umar) said and I would have taken off my ihram with those who have put their ihram after performing ‘Umrah.   He said “By this he intended that all the people might have performed equal rites(of Hajj)
1785 | Jabir said “We went out along with the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) raising our voices in talbiyah for Hakk alone(Ifrad) while A’ishah raised her voice in talbiyah for an ‘Umrah. When she reached Sarif, she menstruated. When we came to (Makkah) we circumambulated the Ka’bah and ran between al Safa’ and al Marwah. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) then commanded us that those who had not brought sacrificial animals withthem should put off their ihram (after ‘Umrah). We asked “Which acts are lawful(and which not)? He replied All acts are lawful (that are permissible usually). We had therefore intercourse with our wives, used perfumes, put on our clothes. There remained only four days to perform Hajj at ‘Arafah. We then raised our voice in talbiyah (wearing Ihram for Hajj) on the eighth of Dhu al Hijjah. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) entered upon A’ishah and found her weeping. He said What is the matter with you? My problem is that I have menstruated, while the people have put on their ihram but I have not done so, nor did I go round the House(the Ka’bah). Now the people are proceeding for Hajj. He said This is a thing destined by Allah to the daughters of Adam. Take a bath, then raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj(i.e, wear ihram for Hajj). She took a abtah and performed all the rites of the Hajj(lit. she stayed at all those places where the pilgrims stay). When she was purified, she circumambulated the House (the Ka’bah), and ran between al Safa’ and al Marwah. He (the Prophet) said “Now you have performed both your Hajj and your ‘Umrah. She said Messenger of Allah, I have some misgiving in my mind that I did not go round the Ka’bah when I performed Hajj (in the beginning). He said ‘Abd al Rahman (her brother), take her and have her perform ‘Umrah from Al Tan’im. This happened on the night of Al Hasbah(i.e., the fourteenth of Dhu Al Hijjah).
1786 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Jabir through a different chain of narrators. This version has The Prophet(ﷺ) said “Raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj and then perform Hajj, and do so all the pilgrims do, except that you should not circumambulate the Hose(the Ka’bah) and should not pray.
1787 | Jabir bin Abdullah said “We raised our voices in talbiyah along with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) exclusively for Hajj, not combining anything with it. When we came to Makkah four days of Dhu al Hijjah had already passed. We the circumambulated (the Ka’bah) and ran between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah . The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then commanded us to put off ihram. He said if I had not brought the sacrificial animals, I would have taken off Ihram. Suraqah bin Malik then stood up and said Apostle of Allaah , what do you think, have you provided this facility to us for this year alone or forever? The Apostle of Allaah said No, this forever and forever.   Al Awza’l said I heard Ata bin Abi Rabah narrating this tradition, but I did not memorize it till I met Ibn Juraij who confirmed it for me.
1788 | Jabir said The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and his companions came to Makkah on the fourth of Dhu Al Hijjah. When they circumambulated the Ka’bah and ran between al Safa’ and al Marwah the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said Change this (Hajj) into ‘Umrah, except those who have brought the sacrificial animals with them. When the eighth of Dhul Al Hijjah came, they raised their voices in talbiyah for Hall. When the tenth of Dhul Al Hijjah came, they circumambulated the Ka’bah, but did not run between al Safa’ and Al Marwah.
1789 | Jabir bin Abdullah said The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and his companions raised their voices in talbiyah for Hajj. No one of them had brought the sacrificial animals with them except the Prophet(ﷺ) and Talhah. Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) had returned from Yemen and had brought sacrificial animals with him. He said I raised my voice in talbiyah for which the Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) raised his voice. The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded his companions to change it into ‘Umrah and clip their hair after running (between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah), and then take off their ihram except those who brought the sacrificial animals with them. They remarked should we go to Mina with our penises dripping with prostatic fluid? These remarks reached the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). Thereupon he said “had I known before hand about my affair what I have come to know later, I would not have brought sacrificial animals. Had I not brought sacrificial animals with me, I would have put off my ihram. “
1790 | Ibn ‘Abbas reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying This is an ‘Umrah from which we have benefitted. Anyone who has brought sacrificial animal with him should take off ihram totally. ‘Umrah has been included in Hajj till the Day of Judgment.    Abu Dawud said This is a munkar (uncommon) tradition. This is in fact the statement of Ibn ‘Abbas himself.
1791 | Ibn ‘Abbas reported the Prophet(ﷺ) as saying If a man raises his voice in talbiya for Hajj, then he comes to Makkah, goes round the House(the Ka’bah) and runs between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah he may take off his ihram. That will be considered as ihram for ‘Umrah.   Abu Dawud said Ibn Juraij narrated from a man on the authority of ‘Ata that the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Makkah raising their voices in talbiyah for Hajj alone, but the Prophet (ﷺ) changed it to ‘Umrah.
1792 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) raised his voice in talbiyah for hajj. When he came (to Mecca) he went round the House (the Ka'bah) and ran between as-Safa and al-Marwah. The narrator Ibn Shawkar said: He did not clip his hair, nor did he take off his ihram due to sacrificial animals. But he commanded those who did not bring sacrificial animals with them to go round the Ka'bah, to run between as-Safa and al-Marwah, to clip their hair, and then put off their ihram. The narrator Ibn Mani' added: Or shave their heads, then take off their ihram."
1793 | Narrated Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab:      A man from the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) came to Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him). He bore witness before him that when he (the Prophet) was suffering from a disease of which he died he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibiting performing of umrah before hajj.
1794 | Narrated Mu'awiyah ibn AbuSufyan:      Mu'awiyah said to the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ): Do you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited from doing so and so (and he prohibited from) riding on the skins of leopards? They said: Yes.       He again said: You know that he prohibited combining hajj and umrah. They replied: This we do not (know). He said: This was prohibited along with other things, but you forgot.
1795 | Anas bin Malik said I heard the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) uttering talbiyah(labbaik) aloud for both Hajj and ‘Umrah. He was saying in a loud voice “Labbaik for ‘Umrah and Hajj, labbaik for ‘Umrah and Hajj”.
1796 | Anas said The Prophet(ﷺ) passed the night at Dhu al Hulaifah till the morning came. He then rode (on his she Camel) which stood up with him on her back. When he reached al Baida, he praied Allaah, glorified Him and expressed His greatness. He then raised his voice in talbiyah for Hajj and ‘Umrah. The people too raised their voices in talbiyah for both of them. When we came (to Makkah), he ordered the people to take off their ihram and they did so. When the eight of Dhu Al Hijjah came, they again raised their voices in talbiyah for Hajj (i.e., wore ihram for Hajj). The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) sacrificed seven Camels standing with his own hand.   Abu Dawud said The version narrated by Anas alone has the words. He began with the praise, glorification and exaltation of Allaah, then he raised his voice in talbiyah for Hajj.
1797 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      I was with Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) appointed him to be the governor of the Yemen. I collected some ounces of gold during my stay with him.        When Ali returned from the Yemen to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) he said: I found that Fatimah had put on coloured clothes and the smell of the perfume she had used was pervading the house. (He expressed his amazement at the use of coloured clothes and perfume.)        She said: What is wrong with you? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has ordered his companions to put off their ihram and they did so.        Ali said: I said to her: I raised my voice in talbiyah for which the Prophet (ﷺ) raised his voice (i.e. I wore ihram for qiran). Then I came to the Prophet (ﷺ).        He asked (me): How did you do?  I replied: I raised my voice in talbiyah, for which the Prophet (ﷺ) raised his voice.  He said: I have brought the sacrificial animals with me and combined umrah and hajj. He said to me: Sacrifice sixty-seven or sixty-six camels (for me) and withhold for yourself thirty-three or thirty-four, and withhold a piece (of flesh) for me from every camel.
1798 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      As-Subayy ibn Ma'bad said: I raised my voice in talbiyah for both of them (i.e. umrah and hajj). Thereupon Umar said: You were guided to the practice (sunnah) of your Prophet (ﷺ).
1799 | Narrated As-Subayy ibn Ma'bad:      I was a Christian Bedouin; then I embraced Islam. I came to a man of my tribe, who was called Hudhaym ibn Thurmulah. I said to him. O brother, I am eager to wage war in the cause of Allah (i.e. jihad), and I find that both hajj and umrah are due from me. How can I combine them?        He said: Combine them and sacrifice the animal made easily available for you. I, therefore, raised my voice in talbiyah for both of them (i.e. umrah and hajj). When I reached al-Udhayb, Salman ibn Rabi'ah and Zayd ibn Suhan met me while I was raising my voice in talbiyah for both of them.        One of them said to the other: This (man) does not have any more understanding than his camel. Thereupon it was as if a mountain fell on me.        I came to Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) and said to him: Commander of the Faithful, I was a Christian Bedouin, and I have embraced Islam. I am eager to wage war in the cause of Allah (jihad), and I found that both hajj and umrah were due from me. I came to a man of my tribe who said to me: Combine both of them and sacrifice the animal easily available for you. I have raised my voice in talbiyah for both of them.        Umar thereupon said to me: You have been guided to the practice (sunnah) of your Prophet) (ﷺ).
1800 | Umar bin Al Khattab heard the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) say Someone came to me at night from Allaah the Exalted. The narrator said When he was staying at ‘Aqiq said Pray in his blessed valley. Then he said ‘Umrah has been included in Hajj.   Abu Dawud said Al Walid bin Musilm and ‘Umar bin Abd Al Wahid narrated in this version from Al Auza’I the words “And say An ‘Umrah included in Hajj”.   Abu Dawud said Ali bin Al Mubarak has also narrated similarly from Yahya bin said Abi Kathir in this version “And say An ‘Umrah included in Hajj”.
1801 | Narrated Saburah:      Ar-Rabi' ibn Saburah said on the authority of his father (Saburah): We went out along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) till we reached Usfan, Suraqah ibn Malik al-Mudlaji said to him: Messenger of Allah, explain to us like the people as if they were born today. He said: Allah, the Exalted, has included this umrah in your hajj. When you come (to Mecca), and he who goes round the House (the Ka'bah), and runs between as-Safa and al-Marwah, is allowed to take off ihram except he who has brought the sacrificial animals with him.
1802 | Ibn ‘Abbas said that Mu’awiyah reported to him I clipped some hair of the Prophet’s(ﷺ) head with a broad iron arrowhead at Al Marwah; or (he said) I saw him that the hair of his head was clipped with a broad iron arrowhead at Al Marwah.   The narrator Ibn Khallad said in his version “Mu’awiyah said” and not the word “reported”.
1803 | Ibn Abbas said that Mu'awiyah told him:do you not know that I clipped the hair of the head of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with a broad iron arrowhead at al-Marwah? Al-Hasan added in his version: "during his hajj."
1804 | Ibn ‘Abbas said The Prophet(ﷺ) raised his voice in talbiyah for ‘Umrah and his companions for Hajj.
1805 | ‘Abd Allah bin Umar said At the Farewell Pilgrimage the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) put on ihram first for ‘Umrah and afterwards for Hajj and drove the sacrificial animals along with him from Dhu Al Hulaifah. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) first raised his voice in talbiyah for ‘Umrah and afterwards he did so for Hajj; and the people along with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) did it first for ‘Umrah and afterwards for Hajj. Some of the people had brought sacrificial animals and others had not, so when the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) came to Makkah , he said to the people. Those of you who have brought sacrificial animals must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for you till you complete your Hajj; but those of you who have not brought sacrificial animals should go round the House(Ka’bah) and run between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah, clip their hair, put off ihram, and afterwards raise their voice in talbiyah for Hajj and bring sacrificial animals. Those who cannot get sacrificial animals should fast three days during Hajj and seven days when they return to their families. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then performed circumambulation when he came to Makkah first touching the corner then running during three circuits out of seven  and walking during four and when he had finished his circumambulation of the House (Ka’bah) he prayed two rak’ahs at Maqam Ibrahim, then giving the salutation and departing he went to Al Safa’ and ran seven times between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful for him till he had completed his Hajj, sacrificed his animals on the day of sacrifice, went quickly and performed the circumambulation of the House(the Ka’bah), after which all that had been unlawful became lawful for him. Those people who had brought sacrificial animals did as the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) did.
1806 | Hafsah, wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), how is it that the people have put off their ihram and you did not put off your ihram after your ‘Umrah. He said I have matted my hair and garlanded my sacrificial animal, so I shall not put off my ihram till I sacrifice my sacrificial animals.
1807 | Abu Dharr used to say about a person who makes the intention of Hajj but he repeal it for the ‘Umrah (that will not be valid). This cancellation of hajj for ‘Umrah was specially meant for the people who accompanied the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ).
1808 | Narrated Bilal ibn al-Harith al-Muzani:      I asked: Messenger of Allah, is the (command of) cancelling hajj meant exclusively for us, or for others too? He replied: No, this is meant exclusively for you.
1809 | ‘Abd Allah bin Abbas said Al Fadl bin Abbas was riding the Camel behind the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). A woman of the tribe of Khath’am came seeking his (the Prophet’s) decision (about a problem relating to Hajj). Al Fadl began to look at her and she too began to look at him. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) would turn the face of Fadl to the other side. She said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) Allaah’s commandment that His servants should perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and is unable to sit firmly on a Camel. May I perform Hajj on his behalf? He said yes, That was at the Farewell Pilgrimage.
1810 | Narrated AbuRazin:      A man of Banu Amir said: Messenger of Allah, my father is very old, he cannot perform hajj and umrah himself nor can be ride on a mount. He said: Perform hajj and umrah on behalf of your father.
1811 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) heard a man say: Labbayk (always ready to obey) on behalf of Shubrumah. He asked: Who is Shubrumah? He replied: A brother or relative of mine. He asked: Have you performed hajj on your own behalf? He said: No. He said: perform hajj on your own behalf, then perform it on behalf of Shubrumah.
1812 | Ibn ‘Umar said Talbiyah uttered by the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was Labbaik(always ready to obey), O Allaah labbaik, labbaik; Thou hast no partner, praise and grace are Thine, and the Dominion, Thou hast no partner. The narrator said ‘Abd Allaah bin ‘Umar used to add to his talbiyah Labbaik, labbaik, labbaik wa sa’daik(give me blessing after blessing) and good is Thy hands, desire and actions are directed towards Thee.
1813 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his voice in talbiyah; he then mentioned the wordings of talbiyah like the tradition narrated by Ibn Umar. The people used to add the words dhal-ma'arij (the Possessor of ladders) and similar other words (to talbiyah) while the Prophet (ﷺ) heard them utter these words, but he did not say anything to them.
1814 | Narrated as-Sa'ib al-Ansari:      Khalid ibn as-Sa'ib al-Ansari on his father's authority reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Gabriel came to me and commanded me to order my Companions to raise their voices in talbiyah.
1815 | Al Fadl bin Abbas said The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) uttered talbiyah till he threw pebbles at Jamrat Al ‘Aqbah.
1816 | ‘Abd Allah bin Umar said We proceeded along with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) from Mina to ‘Arafat, some of us were uttering talbiyah and the others were shouting “Allaah is most great.”
1817 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A person who performs umrah should shout talbiyah till he touches the Black Stone.     Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by 'Abd al-Malik b. Abi Sulaiman and Hammam from 'Ata on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas as his own statement (i.e. the tradition was not attributed to the Prophet)
1818 | Narrated Asma' bint AbuBakr:      We came out for performing hajj along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When we reached al-Araj, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) alighted and we also alighted. Aisha sat beside the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I sat beside my father (AbuBakr). The equipment and personal effects of AbuBakr and of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) were placed with AbuBakr's slave on a camel. AbuBakr was sitting and waiting for his arrival. He arrived but he had no camel with him. He asked:        Where is your camel?  He replied: I lost it last night.  AbuBakr said: There was only one camel, even that you have lost.  He then began to beat him while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was smiling and saying: Look at this man who is in the sacred state (putting on ihram), what is he doing?        Ibn AbuRizmah said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spoke nothing except the words: Look at this man who is in the sacred state (wearing ihram), what is he doing? He was smiling (when he uttered these words).
1819 | Narrated Ya'la ibn Umayyah:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was at al-Ji'ranah. He was wearing perfume or the mark of saffron was on him and he was wearing a tunic.        He said: Messenger of Allah, what do you command me to do while performing my Umrah. In the meantime, Allah, the Exalted, sent a revelation to the Prophet (ﷺ).        When he (the Prophet) came to himself gradually, he asked: Where is the man who asking about umrah? (When the man came) he (the Prophet) said: Wash the perfume which is on you, or he said: (Wash) the mark of saffron (the narrator is doubtful), take off the tunic, then do in your umrah as you do in your hajj.
1820 | This tradition has also been narrated by Ya’la bin Umayyah through a different chain of narrators. This version adds The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him “Take off your tunic”. He then took it off from his head. The narrator then narrated the rest of the tradition.
1821 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Ya’la bin Umayyah through a different chain of narrators. This version adds The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) commanded  him to take it off (the tunic) and to take a bath twice or thrice. The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition.
1822 | It is narrated by Ya’la bin Umayyah that a man came to Prophet (ﷺ) at Ji’ranah, putting on ihram for ‘Umrah. He had a cloak on him and his beard and head had been dyed.
1823 | ‘Abd Allaah bin Umar said A man asked the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) What clothing one should put on if one intend to put on ihram? He said He should not wear shirts, turbans, trousers, garments with head coverings and clothing which has any dye of waras or saffron; one should not put on shoes unless one cannot get sandals. If one cannot get sandals, one should wear the shoes, in which case one must cut them to come below the ankles.
1824 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Ibn ‘Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ) to the same effect.
1825 | This tradition has also been transmitted through a different chain of narrators by Ibn ‘Umar to the same effect. This version adds “A woman in the sacred state(while wearing ihram) should not be veiled or wear gloves.   Abu Dawud said This tradition has also been transmitted by Hatim bin Isma’il and Yahya bin Ayyub from Musa bin ‘Uqbah from ‘Nafi as reported by al Laith. This has also been narrated by Musa bin Tariq from Musa bin ‘Uqbah as a statement of Ibn ‘Umar(not of the Prophet). Similarly, this tradition has also been transmitted by ‘Ubaid Allah bin Umar, Malik and Ayyub as a statement of Ibn ‘Umar (not of the Prophet). Ibrahim bin Sa’id al Madini narrated this tradition from Nafi’ on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ) A woman in the sacred state (wearing ihram) must not be veiled or wear gloves.   Abu Dawud said Ibrahim bin Sa’id al Madini is a traditionist of Madina. Not many traditions have been narrated by him.
1826 | Ibn ‘Umar reported that the Prophet(ﷺ) as saying A woman in the sacred state (wearing ihram) must not be veiled or wear gloves.
1827 | ‘Abd Allaah bin Umar said that he heard the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) prohibiting women in the sacred state (wearing ihram) to wear gloves, veil(their faces) and to wear clothes with dye of waras or saffron on them. But afterwards they can wear any kind of clothing they like dyed yellow or silk or jewelry or trousers or shirts or shoes.   Abu Dawud said ‘Abdah and Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated this tradition from Muhammad bin Ishaq up to the words “And to wear clothes with dye of waras or saffron on them”. They did not mention the words after them.
1828 | Nafi' said Ibn ‘Umar felt cold and said Throw a garment over me, ‘Nafi. I threw a hooded cloak over him. Thereupon he said Are you throwing this over me when the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) has forbidden those who are in sacred state to wear it?
1829 | Ibn ‘Abbas said I heard the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) say When one who is wearing ihram cannot get a lower garment(loin cloth) he may ear trousers and when he cannot get sandals he may wear shoes.    Abu Dawud said This is the tradition narrated by the narrators of Makkah. Its narrator from Basrah is Jabir bin Zaid. He mentioned only trousers and omitted the mention of cutting of the shoes.
1830 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:We were proceeding to Mecca along with the Prophet (ﷺ). We pasted on our foreheads the perfume known as sukk at the time of wearing ihram. When one of us perspired, it (the perfume) came down on her face. The Prophet (ﷺ) saw it but did not forbid it.
1831 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Salim ibn Abdullah said: Abdullah ibn Umar used to do so, that is to say, he would cut the shoes of a woman who put on ihram; then Safiyyah, daughter of AbuUbayd, reported to him that Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated to her that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave licence to women in respect of the shoes (i.e. women are not required to cut the shoes). He, therefore, abandoned it.
1832 | Al Bara’ (bin Azib) said When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) concluded the treaty with the people of Al Hudaibiyyah, they stipulated that they (the Muslims)  would not enter (Makkah) except with the bag of armament (julban al-silah). I asked what is julban al-silah? He replied:The bag with its contents.
1833 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Riders would pass us when we accompanied the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while we were in the sacred state (wearing ihram). When they came by us, one of us would let down her outer garment from her head over her face, and when they had passed on, we would uncover our faces.
1834 | Umm al Hussain said We performed the Farewell Pilgrimage along with the Prophet(ﷺ) . I saw Usamah and Bilal one of them holding the halter of the she-Camel of the Prophet(ﷺ), while the other raising his garment and sheltering from the heat till he had thrown pebbles at the jamrah of the ‘Aqabah.
1835 | Ibn ‘Abbas said The Prophet(ﷺ) had himself cupped when he was in the sacred state(wearing ihram).
1836 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had himself cupped in his head when he was in the sacred state (wearing ihram due to a disease from which he was suffering.
1837 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had himself cupped on the surface of his foot because of a pain in it while he was in the sacred state (wearing ihram).    Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad say: "Ibn Abi 'Arubah narrated it in Mursal form". Meaning from Qatadah.
1838 | Nubaih bin Wahb said ‘Umar bin ‘Ubaid Allah bin Ma’mar had a complaint in his eyes. He sent (someone) to  Aban bin ‘Uthman  - the narrator Sufyan said that he was the chief of pilgrims during the season of Hajj – asking him what he should do with them. He said Apply aloes to them, for I heard ‘Uthaman narrating this on the authority of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ).
1839 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Nubaih bin Wahb through a different chain of narrators.
1840 | ‘Abd Allah bin Hunain said ‘Abd Allah bin Abbas and Miswar bin Makhramah differed amongst themselves (on the question of washing the head in the sacred state) at al Abwa. ‘Ibn Abbas said A pilgrim in the sacred state (while wearing ihram) can wash his head. Al Miswar said A pilgrim in the sacred state(wearing ihram) cannot wash his head. ‘Abd Allah bin Abbas then sent him (‘Abd Allah bin Hunain) to Abu Ayyub Al Ansari. He found him taking a bath between two woods erected at the edge of the well and he was hiding himself with a cloth (curtain). He (the narrator) said I saluted him. He asked Who is this? I said I am ‘Abd Allah bin Hunain. ‘Abd Allah bin Abbas has sent me to you asking you how the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) used to wash his head while he was wearing ihram. Abu Ayyub then put his hand on the cloth and removed it till his head appeared to me. He then said to a person who was pouring water on him:Pour water. He poured water on his head and Abu Ayyub moved his head with his hands. He carried his hands forward and backward.  He then said I saw him doing similarly.
1841 | Nubaih bin Wahb brother of Banu Abd Al Dar said ‘Umar bin Ubaid Allah sent someone to Aban bin Uthman bin Affan asking him (to participate in the marriage ceremony). Aban in those days was the chief of the pilgrims and both were in the sacred state (wearing ihram). I want to give the daughter of Shaibah bin Jubair to Talhah bin Umar in marriage. I wish that you may attend it. Aban refused and said I heard my father ‘Uthman bin Affan narrating a tradition from the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying A pilgrim may not marry and give someone in marriage in the sacred state(while wearing ihram).
1842 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Aban bin ‘Uthman on the authority of ‘Uthman from the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) in a similar manner. This version adds “And he should not make a betrothal”
1843 | Yazid bin Al Asamm, Maimunah’s nephew said on Maimunah’s authority The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) married me when we were not in the sacred state at Sarif.
1844 | Ibn ‘Abbas said The Prophet(ﷺ) married Maimunah while he was in the sacred state(wearing ihram).
1845 | Sa’id bin Al Musayyib said There is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn ‘Abbas about the marriage (of the Prophet) with Maimunah while he was in the sacred state.
1846 | Ibn ‘Umar said The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked as to which of the creatures could be killed by a pilgrim in the sacred state. He said there are five creatures which it is not a sin for anyone to kill, outside or inside the sacred area. The Scorpion, the Crow, the Rat, the Kite and the biting Dog.
1847 | Abu Hurairah reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying There are five(creatures) the killing of  which is lawful in the sacred territory. The Snake, the Scorpion, the Kite, the Rat and the biting Dog.
1848 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked which of the creatures a pilgrim in sacred state could kill. He replied: The snake, the scorpion, the rat; he should drive away the pied crow, but should not kill it; the biting dog, the kite, and any wild animal which attacks (man).
1849 | Abdullah ibn al-Harith reported on the authority of his father al-Harith:(My father) al-Harith was the governor of at-Ta'if under the caliph Uthman. He prepared food for Uthman which contained birds and the flesh of wild ass. He sent it to Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). When the Messenger came to him he was beating leaves for camels and shaking them off with his hand. He said to him: Eat it. He replied: Give it to the people who are not in sacred state; we are wearing ihram. I adjure the people of Ashja' who are present here. Do you know that a man presented a wild ass to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while he was in ihram? But he refused to eat from it. They said: Yes.
1850 | Ibn ‘Abbas said Zaid bin ‘Arqam do you know that the limb of a game was presented to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) but he did not accept it. He said “We are wearing ihram”. He replied, Yes.
1851 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: The game of the land is lawful for you (when you are wearing ihram) as long as you do not hunt it or have it hunted on your behalf.    Abu Dawud said: When two traditions from the Prophet (ﷺ) conflict, one should see which of them was followed by his Companions.
1852 | Abu Qatadah said that he accompanied the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and he stayed behind on the way to Makkah with some of his companions who were wearing ihram, although he was not. When he saw a wild ass he mounted his horse and asked them to hand him his whip, but they refused. He then asked them to hand him his lance. When they refused, he took it, chased the while ass and killed it. Some of the Companions of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) ate it and some refused (to eat). When they met the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) they asked him about it. He said that was the food that Allaah provided you for eating.
1853 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying “Locusts are counted along with what is caught in the sea (i.e., the game of the sea).”
1854 | Abu Hurairah said, We found a swarm of Locusts. A man who was wearing ihram began to strike it with his whip. He was told that his action was not valid. The fact was mentioned to the Prophet (ﷺ); He said “That is counted along with the game of the sea.”   I heard Abu Dawud say “The narrator Abu Al Muhzim is weak. Both these traditions are based on misunderstanding.
1855 | Ka’ab said “Locusts are counted along with the game of the sea.”
1856 | Ka’ab bin ‘Ujrah said that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) came upon him (during their stay) at Al Hudaibiyyah. He asked do the insects of your head (lice) annoy you? He said Yes. The Prophet (ﷺ) said Shave your head, then sacrifice a sheep as offering or fast three days or give three sa’s of dates to six poor people.
1857 | Ka’ab bin ‘Ujrah said that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said to him, If you like sacrifice an animal or if you like fast three days or if you like give three sa’s of dates to six poor people.
1858 | Narrated Ka'b ibn Ujrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came upon him (during their stay) at al-Hudaybiyyah. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. This version adds: "He asked: Do you have a sacrificial animal? He replied: No. He then said: Fast three days or give three sa's of dates to six poor people, giving one sa' to every two persons."
1859 | A man from the Ansar said on the authority of Ka'b ibn Ujrah that he was feeling pain in his head (due to lice); so he shaved his head. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered him to sacrifice a cow as offering.
1860 | Ka’b bin ‘Ujrah said I had lice in my head when I accompanied the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) in the year of Al Hudaibiyyah so much so that I feared about my eyesight. So Allaah, the exalted revealed these verses about me. “And whoever among you is sick or hath an aliment of the head.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) called me and said “Shave your head and fast three days or give a faraq of raisins to six poor men or sacrifice a goat. So, I shaved my head and sacrificed.
1861 | It was reported from 'Abdul-Karim bin Malik Al-Jazari, from 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila, from Ka'b bin Ujrah, regarding this incident (as narrated in on previous hadith), and he added:"Whichever of these you do, it will suffice."
1862 | Al Hajjaj bin ‘Amr Al Ansari reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “ If anyone breaks (a bone or leg) or becomes lame, he has come out of the sacred state and must perform Hajj the following year.” ‘Ikrimah said I asked Ibn ‘Abbas and Abu Hurairah about this. They replied He spoke the truth.
1863 | Narrated al-Hajjaj ibn Amr:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone breaks (a leg) or becomes lame or falls ill. He then narrated the tradition to the  same effect. The narrator Salamah ibn Shabib said: Ma'mar narrated (this tradition) to us.
1864 | Maymun ibn Mahran said:I came out to perform umrah in the year when the people of Syria besieged Ibn az-Zubayr at Mecca. Some people of my tribe sent sacrificial animals with me as an offering. When we reached the people of Syria, they stopped us from entering the sacred territory. I, therefore, sacrificed the animals at the same spot. I then took off ihram and returned.       Next year I came out to make an atonement for my umrah. I came to Ibn Abbas and asked him (about it). He said: Bring a new sacrificial animal, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered his companions to bring fresh sacrificial animals for the umrah of atonement in lieu of the animals they had sacrificed in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah.
1865 | Nafi’ said It was Ibn ‘Umar’s habit that whenever he came to Makkah he spent the night at Dhu Tuwa in the morning he would take a bath and enter Makkah in the daytime. He used to say the Prophet (ﷺ) had done so.
1866 | Ibn ‘Umar said The Prophet (ﷺ) used to enter Makkah from the upper hillock. The version of Yahya goes:The Prophet (ﷺ) used to enter Makkah from Kuda’ from the hillock of Batha’. He would come out from the lower hillock.   Al Barmaki added “that is the two hillocks of Makkah”.    The version of Musaddad is more complete.
1867 | Ibn ‘Umar said The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to come out from (Medina) by the way of Al Shajarah and enter (Makkah) by the way of Al Mu’arras.
1868 | A’ishah said The Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) entered Makkah from the side of Kuda’ the upper end of Makkah in the year of conquest (of Makkah) and he entered from the side of Kida’ when he performed ‘Umrah. ‘Urwah used to enter (Makkah) from both sides, but he often entered from the side of Kuda’ as it was nearer to his house.
1869 | A’ishah said When the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Makkah he entered from the side of the upper end and he came out from the side of the lower end.
1870 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      was asked about a man who looks at the House (the Ka'bah) and raises his hands (for prayer). He replied: I did not find anyone doing this except the Jews. We performed hajj along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but he did not do so.
1871 | Abu Hurairah said When the Prophet(ﷺ) entered Makkah he circumambulated the House(the Ka’bah) and offered two rak’ahs of prayer behind the station. That is, he did so on the day of the Conquest (of Makkah).
1872 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came an entered Mecca, and after the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had gone forward to the Stone, and touched it, he went round the House (the Ka'bah). He then went to as-Safa and mounted it so that he could look at the House. Then he raised his hands began to make mention of Allah as much as he wished and make supplication. The narrator said: The Ansar were beneath him. The narrator Hashim said: He prayed and praised Allah and asked Him for what he wished to ask.
1873 | Abis bin Rabi’ah said on the authority of ‘Umar He(‘Umar) came to the (Black) Stone and said “ I know for sure that you are a stone which can neither benefit nor injure and had I not seen the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) kissing you, I would not have kissed you.”
1874 | Ibn ‘Umar said I have not seen the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) touching anything in the House (the Ka’bah) but the two Yamani corners.
1875 | Ibn Umar was informed about the statement of Aisha that a part of al-Hijr is included in the magnitude of the Ka'bah. Ibn Umar said:By Allah, I think that she must have heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I think that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had not given up touching both of them but for the reason that they were not on the foundation of the House (the Ka'bah), nor did the people circumambulate (the House) beyond al-Hijr for this reason.
1876 | Ibn ‘Umar said The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) did not give up touching the Yamani corner and the (Black) Stone in each of his circumambulations. Ibn ‘Umar used to do so.
1877 | Ibn ‘Abbas said The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) performed the circumambulation at the Farewell Pilgrimage on a Camel and touched the corner(Black Stone) with a crooked stick.
1878 | Narrated Safiyyah, daughter of Shaybah:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had some rest at Mecca in the year of its Conquest, he performed circumambulation on a camel and touched the corner (black Stone) with a crooked stick in his hand. She said: I was looking at him.
1879 | Abu Al Tufail reported on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas who said I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) circumambulating the Ka’bah on his Camel, touching the corner (Black Stone) with a crooked stick and kissing it (the crooked stick). The narrator Muhammad bin Rafi’ added “he then went o Al Safa and Al Marwah and ran seven times on his Camel.
1880 | Jabir bin ‘Abd Allah said The Prophet(ﷺ) performed the circumambulation of the House(the  Ka’bah) on his Camel at the Farewell Pilgrimage and ran between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah, so that the people could see him, remain well informed about him and ask him questions(about Hajj) for the people surrounded him.
1881 | Ibn ‘Abbas said When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) came to Makkah he was ill. So, he performed the circumambulation on his Camel. He touched the corner (Black Stone) with a crooked stick as often as he came to it. When he finished the circumambulation, he made his Camel kneel down and offered two rak’ahs of prayer.
1882 | Umm Salamah said I complained to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) that I was ill. He said “Perform the circumambulation riding behind the people”. She said “I performed circumambulation and the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was praying towards the side of the House(the Ka’bah) and reciting “by al Tur and a Book inscribed”.”
1883 | Narrated Ya'la:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went round the House (the Ka'bah) wearing a green Yamani mantle under his right armpit with the end over his left shoulder.
1884 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions performed umrah from al-Ji'ranah. They went quickly round the House (the Ka'bah) moving their shoulders) proudly. They put their upper garments under their armpits and threw the ends over their left shoulders.
1885 | Abu Al Tufail said I said to Ibn ‘Abbas Your people think that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) walked proudly with swift strides while going round the Ka’bah and that it is sunnah (practice of the Prophet). He said “They spoke the truth (in part) and told a lie (in part).” I asked “What truth did they speak and what lie did they tell?” He said “They spoke the truth that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) walked proudly while going round the Ka’bah but they told a lie, this is no sunnah. The Quraish asserted during the days of Al Hudaibiyyah “Forsake Muhammad and his Companions till they die the death of a Camel which dies of bacteria in its nose. When they concluded a treaty with him agreeing upon the fact that they (the Prophet and his Companions) would come (to Makkah) next year and stay at Makkah three days, the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said to the Companions “Walk proudly (moving shoulders) while going round the Ka’bah in first three circuits. (Ibn ‘Abbas said) But this is not sunnah. I said “Your people think that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) ran between Al Safa and Al Marwah on a Camel and that is sunnah.” He said “They spoke the truth (in part) and told a lie (in part). I asked “What truth did they speak and what lie did they tell? He said “they spoke the truth that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) ran between Al Safa and Al Marwah on a Camel. They told a lie that it is a sunnah. As the people did not move from around the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and did not separate themselves from him he did the sa’i on a Camel so that they may listen to him and see his position and their hands might not reach him.
1886 | Ibn ‘Abbas said The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) came to Makkah while the fever of Yathrib (Medina) had weakened them. Thereupon the disbelievers said “The people whom the fever has weakened and who suffer misery at Medina are coming to you.” Allaah, the exalted, informed the Prophet (ﷺ) of what they had said. He, therefore, ordered them to perform ramal (walk proudly with swift pace) in first three circuits and walk ordinarily between the two corners (Yamani Corner and the Black Stone). When they saw them the believers walking proudly, they said” These are the people about whom you mentioned that the fever had weakened them, but they are more vigorous than us.”   Ibn ‘Abbas said “He did not order them to walk proudly in all circuits (of the circumambulation) out of mercy upon them.”
1887 | Aslam said:I heard Umar ibn al-Khattab say: What is the need of walking proudly (ramal) and moving the shoulders (while going round the Ka'bah)? Allah has now strengthened Islam and obliterated disbelief and the infidels. In spite of that we shall not forsake anything that we used to do during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
1888 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Going round the House (the Ka'bah), running between as-Safa and lapidation of the pillars are meant for the remembrance of Allah.
1889 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) wore the mantle under his right armpit with the end over his left shoulder, and touched the corner (Black Stone), then uttered "Allah is most great" and walked proudly in three circuits of circumambulation. When they (the Companions) reached the Yamani corner, and disappeared from the eyes of the Quraysh, they walked as usual; When they appeared before them, they walked proudly with rapid strides. Thereupon the Quraysh said: They look to be the deer (that are jumping). Ibn Abbas said: Hence this became the sunnah (model behaviour of the Prophet).
1890 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions performed umrah from al-Ji'ranah and walked proudly with rapid strides round the House (the Ka'bah) in three circuits and walked as usual in four circuits.
1891 | Nafi’ said Ibn ‘Umar walked proudly (ramal) from the corner (Black Stone) to the corner (Black Stone) and mentioned that the Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) had done so.
1892 | Narrated Abdullah ibn as-Sa'ib:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say between the two corners: O Allah, bring us a blessing in this world and a blessing in the next and guard us from punishment of Hell.
1893 | Ibn ‘Umar said When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) observed the circumambulation at hajj and ‘Umrah on his arrival, he ran three circuits and walked four, then he made two prostrations.
1894 | Narrated Jubayr ibn Mut'im:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Do not prevent anyone from going round this House (the Ka'bah) and from praying any moment he desires by day or by night. The narrator Fadl (ibn Ya'qub) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Banu Abdu Munaf, do not stop anyone.
1895 | Jabir bin ‘Abdallah said “Neither the Prophet (ﷺ) nor his Companions ran between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah except once and that was his first running.”
1896 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who accompanied him did not go round the Ka'bah till they threw pebbles at the Jamrah (pillar at Mina).
1897 | ‘Ata said The Prophet (ﷺ) said to A’ishah Your observance of circumambulation of the Ka’bah and your running between Al Safa’ and al Marwah  (only once) are sufficient for your Hajj and your ‘Umrah.   Al Shafi’i said The narrator Sufyan has transmitted this tradition from ‘Ata on the authority of A’ishah and also narrated it on the authority of ‘Ata stating that the Prophet (ﷺ) said to A’ishah(may Allah be pleased with her).
1898 | Narrated AbdurRahman ibn Safwan:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) conquered Mecca, I said (to myself): I shall put on my clothes, and my house lay on the way, I shall watch how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) behaves. So I went out. I saw that the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions had come out from the Ka'bah and embraced the House (the Ka'bah) from its entrance (al-Bab) to al-Hatim. They placed their cheek on the House (the Ka'bah) while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was amongst them.
1899 | Amr b. Shu'aib reported on the authority of his father:I went round the Ka'bah along with Abdullah ibn Amr. When we came behind the Ka'bah I asked: Do you not seek refuge? He uttered the words: I seek refuge in Allah from the Hell-fire. He then went (farther) and touched the Black Stone, and stood between the corner (Black Stone) and the entrance of the Ka'bah. He then placed his breast, his face, his hands and his palms in this manner, and he spread them, and said: I saw the apostle of Allah (ﷺ) doing like this.
1900 | Abdullah ibn as-Sa'ib reported on the authority of his father as-Sa'ib that he used to lead Ibn Abbas (when he become blind) and make him stand in the third corner that was adjacent to the corner (Black Stone) near the entrance of the Ka'bah. Ibn Abbas used to say:Has it been reported to you that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would pray in this place. He would reply: Yes. He then used to stand (there) and pray.
1901 | ‘Urwa bin Al Zubair said I said to A’ishah, wife of the Prophet(ﷺ) while I was a boy. What do you think about the pronouncement of Allaah, the Exalted “Lo! (The Mountains) Al Safa’ and Al Marwah are among the indications of Allaah. “I think there is no harm for anyone if he does not run between them. A’ishah(may Allah be pleased with her) said Nay, had it been so as you said, it would have been thus. It is no sin on him not to go around them. This verse was revealed about the Ansaar, they used to perform hajj for Manat. Manat was erected in front of Qudaid. Hence they used to avoid going around Al Safa and Al Marwah. When Islam came, they asked the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about it. Allaah, the Exalted therefore revealed the verse “Lo! (The Mountains) Al Safa’ and Al Marwah are among the indications of Allaah.
1902 | ‘Abd Allaah bin Abi Aufa said the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) performed ‘Umrah and went round the House(the Ka’bah) and prayed behind the station (Maqam Ibrahim) two rak’ahs and he was accompanied by so many people that he was hidden by them. ‘Abd Allaah bin Abi Aufa was asked Did the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) enter the Ka’bah ? He replied “No”.
1903 | Isma’il bin Abi Khalid said I heard ‘Abd Allaah bin Abi Aufa narrated this tradition. His version added “He then came to Al Safa’ and Al Marwah and ran between them seven times and then shaved his head.
1904 | Kathir ibn Jamhan said:A man asked Abdullah ibn Umar between as-Safa and al-Marwah: AbdurRahman, I see you walking while the people are running (between as-Safa and al-Marwah)? He replied: If I walk, I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) running. I am too old.
1905 | Ja’far bin Muhammad reported on the authority of his father “We entered upon Jabir bin ‘Abd Allaah. When we reached him, he asked about the people (who had come to visit him). When my turn came I said “I am Muhammad bin Ali bin Hussain. He patted my head with his hand and undid my upper then lower buttons. He then placed his hand between my nipples and in those days I was a young boy.” He then said “welcome to you my nephew, ask what you like. I questioned him he was blind. The time of prayer came and he stood wrapped in a mantle. Whenever he placed it on his shoulders its ends fell due to its shortness. He led us in prayer while his mantle was placed on a rack by his side. I said “tell me about the Hajj of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ).”He signed with his hand and folded his fingers indicating nine.  He then said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) remained nine years (at Madeenah ) during which he did not perform Hajj, then made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was about to (go to) perform Hajj. A large number of people came to Madeenah everyone desiring to follow him and act like him. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went out and we too went out with him till we reached Dhu Al Hulaifah. Asma’ daughter of ‘Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abi Bakr. She sent message to Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) asking him What should I do?He replied “take a bath, bandage your private parts with a cloth and put on ihram.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then prayed (in the masjid) and mounted Al Qaswa’ and his she Camel stood erect with him on its back. Jabir said “I saw (a large number of) people on mounts and on foot in front of him and a similar number on his right side and a similar number on his left side and a similar number behind him. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was among us, the Qur’an was being revealed to him and he knew its interpretation. Whatever he did, we did it. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then raised his voice declaring Allaah’s unity and saying “Labbaik ( I am at thy service), O Allaah, labbaik, labbaik, Thou hast no partner praise and grace are Thine and the Dominion. Thou hast no partner. The people too raised their voices in talbiyah which they used to utter. But the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) did not forbid them anything. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) continued his talbiyah. Jabir said “We did not express our intention of performing anything but Hajj, being unaware of ‘Umrah (at that season), but when we came with him to the House (the Ka’bah), he touched the corner (and made seven circuits) walking quickly with pride in three of them and walking ordinarily in four. Then going forward to the station of Abraham he recited “And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.” (While praying two rak’ahs) he kept the station between him and the House. The narrator said My father said that Ibn Nufail and ‘Uthman said I do not know that he (Jabir) narrated it from anyone except the Prophet (ﷺ). The narrator Sulaiman said I do not know but he (Jabir) said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) used to recite in the two rak’ahs “Say, He is Allaah, one” and “Say O infidels”. He then returned to the House (the ka’bah) and touched the corner after which he went out by the gate to Al Safa’. When he reached near Al Safa’ he recited “Al Safa’ and Al Marwah are among the indications of Allaah” and he added “We begin with what Allaah began with”. He then began with Al Safa’ and mounting it till he could see the House (the Ka’bah) he declared the greatness of Allaah and proclaimed his Unity. He then said “there is no god but Allaah alone, Who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates. He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards Al Marwah and when his feet came down into the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached Al Marwah. He did at al Marwah as he had done at Al Safa’ and when he came to Al Marwah for the last time, he said “If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding this matter of mine, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an ‘Umrah, so if any of you has no sacrificial animals, he may take off ihram and treat it as an ‘Umrah. All the people then took off ihram and clipped their hair except the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had brought sacrificial animals. Suraqah (bin Malik) bin Ju’sham then got up and asked Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)does this apply to the present year or does it apply for ever? The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) interwined his fingers and said “The ‘Umarh has been incorporated in Hajj. Adding ‘No’, but forever and ever. ‘Ali came from Yemen with the sacrificial animals of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and found Fathima among one of those who had taken off their ihram. She said put on colored clothes and stained her eyes with collyrium. ‘Ali disliked (this action of her) and asked Who commanded you for this? She said “My father”. Jabir said ‘Ali said at Iraq I went to Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) to complain against Fathima for what she had done and to ask the opinion of Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about which she mentioned to me. I informed him that I disliked her action and that thereupon she said to me “My father commanded me to do this.” He said “She spoke the truth, she spoke the truth.” What did you say when you put on ihram for Hajj? I said O Allaah, I put on ihram for the same purpose for which Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) has put it on. He said I have sacrificial animals with me, so do not take off ihram. He (Jabir) said “The total of those sacrificial animals brought by ‘Ali from Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet (ﷺ) from Madeenah was one hundred.” Then all the people except the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had with them the sacrificial animals took off ihram and clipped their hair. When the 8th of Dhu Al Hijjah (Yaum Al Tarwiyah) came, they went towards Mina having pit on ihram for Hajj and the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) rode and prayed at Mina the noon, afternoon, sunset, night and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up at Namrah. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then sent out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at Al Mash ‘ar Al Haram at Al Muzdalifah, as the Quraish used to do in the pre Islamic period but he passed on till he came to ‘Arafah and found that the tent had been setup at Namrah. There he dismounted and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered Al Qaswa’ to be brought and when it was saddled for him, he went down to the bottom of the valley and addressed the people saying “Your lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in the month of yours in this town of yours. Lo! Everything pertaining to the pre Islamic period has been put under my feet and claims for blood vengeance belonging to the pre Islamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood vengeance I permit is the blood vengeance of ours (according to the version of the narrator ‘Uthman, the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi’ah and according to the version of the narrator Sulaiman the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi’ah bin Al Harith bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib). Some (scholars) said “he was suckled among Banu Sa’d(i.e., he was brought up among Bani Sa’d) and then killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre Islamic period is abolished and the first of usury I abolish is our usury, the usury of ‘Abbas bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib for it is all abolished. Fear Allaah regarding women for you have got them under Allah’s security and have the right to intercourse with them by Allaah’s word. It is a duty from you on them not to allow anyone whom you dislike to lie on your beds but if they do beat them, but not severely. You are responsible for providing them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something by which if you hold to it you will never again go astray, that is Allaah’s Book. You will be asked about me, so what will you say? They replied “We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said “O Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness! Bilal then uttered the call to prayer and the iqamah and he prayed the noon prayer, he then uttered the iqamah and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted (his she Camel) al Qaswa’ and came to the place of standing , making his she Camel Al Qaswa‘ turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him and he faced the qiblah. He remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usamah up behind him and picked the reins of Al Qaswa’ severely so much so that its head was touching the front part of the saddle. Pointing with is right hand he was saying “Calmness, O People! Calmness, O people. Whenever he came over a mound (of sand) he let loose its reins a little so that it could ascend. He then came to Al Muzdalifah where he combined the sunset and night prayers, with one adhan and two iqamahs. The narrator ‘Uthamn said He did not offer supererogatory prayers between them. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer when the morning light was clear. The narrator Sulaiman said with one adhan and one iqamah. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then mounted Al Qaswa’ and came to Al Mash’ar Al Haram and ascended it. The narrators ‘Uthaman and Sulaiman said He faced the qiblah praised Allaah, declared His greatness, His uniqueness. ‘Uthamn added in his version and His Unity and kept standing till the day was very clear. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then went quickly before the sun rose , taking Al Fadl bin ‘Abbas behind him. He was a man having beautiful hair, white and handsome color. When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went quickly, the women in the howdas also began to pass him quickly. Al Fadl began to look at them. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) placed his hand on the face of Al Fadl , but Al fadl turned his face towards the other side. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) also turned away his hand to the other side. Al Fadl also turned his face to the other side looking at them till he came to (the Valley of) Muhassir. He urged the Camel a little and following a middle road which comes out at the greatest jamrah, he came to the jamrah which is beside the tree and he threw seven small pebbles at this (jamrah) saying “Allah is most great” each time he threw a pebble like bean seeds. He threw them from the bottom of the valley. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then went to the place of the sacrifice  and sacrificed sixty three Camels with his own hand. He then commanded ‘Ali who sacrificed the remainder and he shared him and his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each Camel should be put in a pot and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. The narrator Sulaiman said the he mounted afterwards the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went quickly to the House (the Ka’bah) and prayed the noon prayer at Makkah. He came to Banu ‘Abd Al Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said draw water Banu ‘Abd Al Muttalib were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you. So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it.
1906 | Ja’far bin Muhammad reported on the authority of his father The Prophet (ﷺ) prayed the noon and the afternoon prayers with one adhan and two iqamahs at ‘Arafah and he did not offer supererogatory prayers between them. He prayed the sunset and night prayers at Al Muzdalifah with one adhan and two iqamahs and he did not offer supererogatory prayers between them.   Abu Dawud said This tradition has been narrated by Hatim bin Isma’il as a part of the lengthy tradition. Muhammad bin ‘Ali Al Ju’fi narrated it from Ja’far from his father on the authority of Jabir, like the tradition transmitted by Hatim bin Isma’il. But this version has He offered the sunset and night prayers with one adhan and one iqamah.
1907 | Jabir said then the Prophet (ﷺ) said “I sacrificed here and the whole of Mina is the place of sacrifice”. He stationed at ‘Arafah and said “I stationed here and the whole of ‘Arafah is the place of station”. He stationed at Al Muzadalifah and said “I stationed here and the whole of Al Muzadalifah is the place of station.”
1908 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Hafs bin Ghiyath from Ja’far with the same chain of narrators. But this version adds “Sacrifice in your dwellings.”
1909 | The tradition has also been transmitted by Jabir through a different chain of narrators. He narrated this tradition and added the words “he recited in two rak’ahs the surah relating to Unity of Allaah” and “Say, O disbelievers” to the Qur’anic verse “And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer. “. This version has ‘Ali said in Kufah. The narrator said “My father said Jabir did not say these words. I went to complain (against Fatimah). He then narrated the story of Fatimah.”
1910 | A’ishah said “Quraish and those who followed their religion used to station at Al Muzdalifah and they were called Al Hums and the rest of Arabs used to station at ‘Arafah. When Islam came, Allaah the most High commanded His Prophet (ﷺ) to go to ‘Arafah and station there then go quickly from it.

He replied: On this day you have been allowed to take off ihram when you have thrown the stones at the jamrahs, that is, everything prohibited during the state of ihram is lawful except intercourse with a woman. If the evening comes before you go round this House (the Ka'bah) you will remain in the sacred state (i.e. ihram), just like the state in which you were before you threw stones at the jamrahs, until you perform the circumambulation of it (i.e. the Ka'bah).

The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Except the rush.”    Abu Dawud said “Ibn Al Musaffa added on the authority of Al Walid Abu Shah a man from the people of the Yemen stood and said “Give me in writing, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)”.

The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) called for drink. Nabidh was brought to him and he drank from it and gave its left over to Usamah bin Zaid who drank from it.

2028 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      I liked to enter the House (the Ka'bah) and pray therein. The Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) caught me by hand and admitted me to al-Hijr.

The protection granted by Muslim is one (even if) the humblest of them grants it. So if anyone breaks a covenant made by a Muslim the curse of Allaah, angels and all men will fall upon him and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him.

He (Salim) was the freed slave of a woman from the Ansar (the Helpers) as the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) adopted Zaid as his son. In pre Islamic days when anyone adopted a man as his son, the people called him by his name and he was given a share from his inheritance. Allaah, the Exalted, revealed about this matter “Call them by (the name of) their fathers, that is juster in the sight of Allaah. And if ye know not their fathers, then (they are) your brethren in the faith and your clients. They were then called by their names of their fathers. A man, whose father was not known, remained under the protection of someone and considered brother in faith. Sahlah daughter of Suhail bin Amr Al Quraishi then came and said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), we used to consider Salim(our) son. He dwelled with me and Abu Hudhaifah in the same house, and he saw me in the short clothes, but Allaah the Exalted, has revealed about them what you know, then what is your opinion about him? The Prophet (ﷺ) said give him your breast feed. She gave him five breast feeds. He then became like her foster son. Hence, A’ishah(may Allaah be pleased with her) used to ask the daughters of her sisters and the daughters of her brethren to give him breast feed five times, whom A’ishah wanted to see and who wanted to visit her. Though he might be of age; he then visited her. But Umm Salamah and all other wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) refused to allow anyone to visit them on the basis of such breast feeding unless one was given breast feed during infancy. They told A’ishah by Allaah we do not know whether that was a special concession granted by the Prophet (ﷺ) to Salim exclusive of the people.
2062 | A’ishah said “In what was sent down in the Qu’ran ten suckling’s made marriage unlawful, but they were abrogated by five known ones and when the Prophet (ﷺ) dies, these words were among what was recited in the Qur’an.”

A woman who is elder (in relation) must not be married to one who had married a woman who is younger (in relation) to her nor a woman who is younger (in relation) must be married to one who has married a woman who is elder (in relation) to her.”
2066 | Abu Hurairah said “The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) forbade that a woman and her maternal aunt and a woman and her paternal aunt are joined in marriage (to the same man).”

2068 | Ibn Shihab said “’Urwah bin Al Zubair asked A’ishah , wife of the Prophet(ﷺ) about the Qur’anic verse “And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans, marry of the women, who seem good to you.” She said “O my nephew, this means the female orphan who is under the protection of her guardian and she holds a share in his property and her property and beauty attracts him; so her guardian intends to marry her without doing justice to her in respect of her dower and he gives her the same amount of dower as others give her. They (i.e., the guardians) were prohibited to marry them except that they do justice to them and pay them their maximum customary dower and they were asked to marry women other than them (i.e., the orphans) who seem good to them. ‘Urwah reported that A’ishah said “The people then consulted the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about women after revelation of this verse. Thereupon Allaah the Exalted sent down the verse “They consult thee concerning  women. Say Allaah giveth you decree concerning them and the scripture which hath been recited unto you(giveth decree) concerning female orphans unto whom you give not that which is ordained for them though  you desire to marry them. “ She said “The mention made by Allaah about the Scripture recited to them refers to the former verse in which Allaah has said “And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans, marry of the women, who seem good to you.” A’ishah said “The pronouncement of Allaah , the Exalted in the latter verse “though you desire to marry them” means the disinterest of one of you in marrying a female orphan who was under his protection, but she said little property and beauty. So they were prohibited to marry them for their interest in the property and beauty of the female orphans due to their disinterest in themselves except that they do justice )to them). The narrator Yunus said “Rabi’ah said explain the Qur’anic verse “And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans” means “Leave them if you fear (that you will not do justice to them), for I have made four women lawful for you.”

I said to him “No”. He then said Will you not give me the sword of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)? I fear the people may not take it from you by force. (He said) By Allaah if you give it to me no one can take it from me so long as I am alive. Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allaah be pleased with him) asked for the hand of Abu Jahl’s daughter in marriage after the marriage with Fathima. I heard the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) say while he was addressing the people about this matter on the pulpit and I was mature in those days. Fathima is from me and I am not afraid that she will be tried in respect of her religion. He then mentioned his other son-in-law who belonged to Banu ‘Abd Shams. He admired him immensely for his relationship with him and extolled him well. He said “He talked to me and talked truly and he made promise with me and fulfilled it. I do not make lawful what Is unlawful and unlawful what is lawful. But, by Allaah the daughter of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and the daughter of the enemy of Allaah can never be combined together.

When a man died, his relatives had more right to his wife then her own guardian. If any one of them wanted to marry her, he did so; or they married her (to some other person), and if they did not want to marry her, they did so. So this verse was revealed about the matter.
2090 | Ibn ‘Abbas explained the Qur’anic verse It is not lawful for you forcibly to inherit the woman (of your deceased kinsmen) nor (that) ye should put constraint upon them that ye may take away a part of that which ye have given them, unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness and said “This means that a man used to inherit a relative woman.

He swore that he would not do that until I fixed a dower afresh other than that agreed between me and him, and I swore that I should not give him the dower other than that I had given him before.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: How old is she now?        He said: She has grown old.  He said: I think you should leave her. He said: This put awe and fear into me, and I looked at the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        When he felt this in me, he said: You will not be sinful, nor will your companion be sinful.

He replied: I have nothing by this lower garment of mine. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If you give your lower garment, you will sit while you have no lower garment. So look for something else. He said: I do not find anything. He said: Look for something, even though it should be an iron ring. The man sought it but found nothing. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you know anything from the Qur'an ? He said: Yes, I know surah so and so, which he named.

He said: In this matter I hold the opinion that she should receive the type of dower given to women of her class with no diminution or excess, observe the waiting period ('iddah) and have her share of inheritance. If it is erroneous, that is from me and from Satan. Allah and His Apostle are free from its responsibility. Some people from Ashja' got up; among them were al-Jarrah and AbuSinan.        They said: Ibn Mas'ud, we bear witness that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave a decision for us regarding Birwa', daughter of Washiq, to the same effect as the decision you have given.

When he was nearing his death, he said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) married me to so-and-so, and I did not fix a dower for her, nor did I give anything to her. I call upon you as witness that I have given my share in Khaybar as her dower. So she took the share and sold it for one lakh (of dirhams).    Abu Dawud said: The version of 'Umar b. al-Khattab added in the beginning of this tradition, and his version is more perfect. He reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: The best marriage is the one that is most easy. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to the man.

I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Apostle.        "You who believe,...fear Allah by Whom you ask your mutual rights, and reverence the wombs. Allah has been watching you." ..."you who believe, fear Allah as He should be feared, and die only as Muslims" ...."you who believe, fear Allah as He should be feared, and die only as Muslims"....."you who believe, fear Allah and say what is true.

It was very rare that he did not visit us any day (i.e. he visited all of us every day). He would come near each of his wives without having intercourse with her until he reached the one who had her day and passed his night with her. When Saudah daughter of Zam'ah became old and feared that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would divorce her, she said: Messenger of Allah, I give to 'Aishah the day you visit me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) accepted it from her. She said: We think that Allah, the Exalted, revealed about this or similar matter the Qur'anic verse: "If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part...." [4:128]

2138 | A’ishah wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) reported “When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) intended to go on a journey he cast lots amongst his wives and the one who was chosen by lot went on it with him. He divided his time, day and night (equally) for each of his wives except that Saudah daughter of Zam’ah gave her day to A’ishah.
2139 | ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir reported the Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) as saying “The condition worthier to be  fulfilled by you is the one by which you made the private parts (of your wife) lawful (for you).
2140 | Narrated Qays ibn Sa'd:      I went to al-Hirah and saw them (the people) prostrating themselves before a satrap of theirs, so I said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has most right to have prostration made before him. When I came to the Prophet (ﷺ), I said: I went to al-Hirah and saw them prostrating themselves before a satrap of theirs, but you have most right, Messenger of Allah, to have (people) prostrating themselves before you. He said: Tell me , if you were to pass my grave, would you prostrate yourself before it? I said: No. He then said: Do not do so. If I were to command anyone to make prostration before another I would command women to prostrate themselves before their husbands, because of the special right over them given to husbands by Allah.
2141 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying “When a man calls his wife to come to his bed and she refuses and does not come to him and he spends the night angry, the angels curse her till the morning.”
2142 | Narrated Mu'awiyah al-Qushayri:      Mu'awiyah asked: Messenger of Allah, what is the right of the wife of one of us over him? He replied: That you should give her food when you eat, clothe her when you clothe yourself, do not strike her on the face, do not revile her or separate yourself from her except in the house.     Abu Dawud said: The meaning of "do not revile her" is, as you say: "May Allah revile you".
2143 | Bahz bin Hakim reported on the authority of his father from his grandfather (Mu'awiyah ibn Haydah) as saying:I said: Messenger of Allah, how should we approach our wives and how should we leave them? He replied: Approach your tilth when or how you will, give her (your wife) food when you take food, clothe when you clothe yourself, do not revile her face, and do not beat her.    Abu Dawud said: The version of Shu'bah has: That you give her food when you have food yourself, and that you clothe her when you clothe yourself.
2144 | Narrated Mu'awiyah al-Qushayri:      I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him: What do you say (command) about our wives? He replied: Give them food what you have for yourself, and clothe them by which you clothe yourself, and do not beat them, and do not revile them.
2145 | Abu Harrah Al Ruqashi reported on the authority of his uncle” The Prophet (ﷺ) said “If you fear the recalcitrance abandon them in their beds.”   The narrator Hammad said “By abandonment he meant abandonment of intercourse.”
2146 | Iyas ibn Abdullah ibn Abu Dhubab reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Do not beat Allah's handmaidens, but when Umar came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Women have become emboldened towards their husbands, he (the Prophet) gave permission to beat them. Then many women came round the family of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) complaining against their husbands. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Many women have gone round Muhammad's family complaining against their husbands. They are not the best among you.
2147 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife.
2148 | Jarir said I asked the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about an accidental glance (on a woman). He (ﷺ) said “Turn your eyes away.”
2149 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: to Ali: Do not give a second look, Ali, (because) while you are not to blame for the first, you have no right to the second.
2150 | Ibn Masu’d reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “ A woman should not rub her body directly with the body of another woman so that she describes it to her husband as if he were looking at her.”
2151 | Jabir said “The Prophet (ﷺ) saw a woman so he entered upon Zainab daughter of Jahsh and had intercourse with her. He (ﷺ) then came out and said to his companions and said to them “A woman advances in the form of a devil. When one of you finds that he should go to his wife (and have intercourse with her) for that will repel what he is feeling.
2152 | Ibn ‘Abbas said “I did not see anything more resembling to minor sins than what Abu Hurairah reported from the Prophet (ﷺ) who said “Allaah has decreed for the children of Adam a share in adultery, he will get it by all means, the adultery of eyes is looking; the adultery of tongue is speaking; the soul desires and has a passion; the private parts confirms or falsifies it.”
2153 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying “ Every child of Adam has his share in adultery. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. This version goes “And the hands commit adultery; their adultery is catching; and the legs commit adultery; their adultery is walking; and the mouth commits adultery – its adultery is kissing.”
2154 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Abu Hurairah through a different chain of narrators. This version adds “The fornication of ear is hearing.”
2155 | Abu Sa’id Al Khudri said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) were reluctant to have relations with the female captives because of their pagan husbands. So, Allaah the exalted sent down the Qur’anic verse “And all married women (are forbidden) unto you save those (captives) whom your right hand posses.” This is to say that they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period.
2156 | Abu Al Darda said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was in a battle. He saw a woman who was nearing the time when she was to deliver a child. “He said “Perhaps the master has intercourse with her.”. They(the people) said “Yes”. He said “I am inclined to invoke a curse on him which will enter his grave with him. How can he make it (the child) an heir when it is not lawful for him? How can he take it into his service when that is not lawful for him?”
2157 | Abu Sa’id Al Khudri traced to Prophet (ﷺ) the following statement regarding the captives taken at Atwas. There must be no intercourse with pregnant woman till she gives birth to her child or with the one who is not pregnant till she has had one menstrual period.
2158 | Narrated Ruwayfi' ibn Thabit al-Ansari:      Should I tell you what I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say on the day of Hunayn: It is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and the last day to water what another has sown with his water (meaning intercourse with women who are pregnant); it is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and the Last Day to have intercourse with a captive woman till she is free from a menstrual course; and it is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and the Last Day to sell spoil till it is divided.
2159 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Ibn Ishaq through a different chain of narrators. This version has the traditional word “a menstrual course” in the phrase “till she is free from a menstrual course”. This is a misunderstanding on the part of the narrator Abu Mu’awiyah. This is correct in the tradition of Abu Sa’id Al Khudri. This version has the additional words “he who believes in Allaah and the Last Day should not ride on a mount belonging to the spoil of Muslims and when he makes it emaciated returns it; he who believes in Allaah and the Last Day should not put on cloth belonging to the spoils of Muslims and when makes it old (shabby) returns it.   Abu Dawud said “The word “menstrual course” is not guarded. This is a misunderstanding on the part of Abu Mu’awiyah”
2160 | 'Amr b. Shu'aib on his father's authority said that his grandfather (Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As) reported the Prophet (ﷺ)  said:If one of you marries a woman or buys a slave, he should say: "O Allah, I ask You for the good in her, and in the disposition You have given her; I take refuge in You from the evil in her, and in the disposition You have given her." When he buys a camel, he should take hold of the top of its hump and say the same kind of thing.    Abu Dawud said: Abu Sa'id added the following words in his version: He should then tale hold of her forelock and pray for blessing in the case of a woman or a slave.
2161 | Ibn ‘Abbas reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying “If anyone who means to have intercourse with his wife says “In the name of Allaah, O Allaah, keep us away from the devil and keep the devil away from what You hast provided us.” It will be ordained that no devil will ever harm the child born to them.
2162 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who has intercourse with his wife through her anus is accursed.
2163 | Muhammad bin Al Munkadir said I heard Jabir say The Jews used to say “When a man has intercourse with his wife through the vagina, but being on her back the child will have a squint, so the verse came down. Your wives are a tilth to you, so come to your tilth however you will.”
2164 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:      Ibn Umar misunderstood (the Qur'anic verse, "So come to your tilth however you will")--may Allah forgive him. The fact is that this clan of the Ansar, who were idolaters, lived in the company of the Jews who were the people of the Book. They (the Ansar) accepted their superiority over themselves in respect of knowledge, and they followed most of their actions. The people of the Book (i.e. the Jews) used to have intercourse with their women on one side alone (i.e. lying on their backs). This was the most concealing position for (the vagina of) the women. This clan of the Ansar adopted this practice from them. But this tribe of the Quraysh used to uncover their women completely, and seek pleasure with them from in front and behind and laying them on their backs.        When the muhajirun (the immigrants) came to Medina, a man married a woman of the Ansar. He began to do the same kind of action with her, but she disliked it, and said to him: We were approached on one side (i.e. lying on the back); do it so, otherwise keep away from me. This matter of theirs spread widely, and it reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur'anic verse: "Your wives are a tilth to you, so come to your tilth however you will," i.e. from in front, from behind or lying on the back. But this verse meant the place of the delivery of the child, i.e. the vagina.
2165 | Anas bin Malik said Among the Jews when a woman menstruated, they did not eat with her and drink with her and did not associate with her in their houses, so the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was questioned about it. Hence, Allah the Exalted revealed “And they ask you about menstruation,. Say “It is harmful, so keep aloof from women during menstruation till the end of the verse. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Associate with them in the houses and do everything except sexual intercourse. The Jews thereupon said “This man does not leave anything we do without opposing us in it. Usaid bin Hudair and Abbad bin Bishr came to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and said, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) the Jews are saying such and such. Shall we not have intercourse with them during their menstruation? The face of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) underwent such a change that we thought he was angry with them, so they went out. They were met by a gift of milk which was being brought to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and he sent after them, whereby we felt that he was not angry with them.
2166 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      I and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to lie in one cloth at night while I was menstruating. If anything from me smeared him, he washed the same place (that was smeared), and did not wash beyond it. If anything from him smeared his clothe, he washed the same place and did not wash beyond that, and prayed with it (i.e. the clothe).
2167 | Maimunah daughter of Al Harith said “When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) intended to associate and lie with any of his wives who was menstruating, he ordered her to wrap up the lower garment(loin-cloth) and then he had association with her.
2168 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said about a man who has sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman: He should give one or half dinar as sadaqah.
2169 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      If a man has sexual intercourse (with menstruating woman) during her bleeding, he should give one dinar as sadaqah, and if he does so when bleeding has stopped, he should give half a dinar as sadaqah.
2170 | Abu Sa’id reported “The people mentioned about withdrawing the penis before the Prophet (ﷺ). He said “Why one of you does so? He did not say “One of you should not do so”. Every soul that is to be born, Allaah will create it. Abu Dawud said “Qaza’ah is a client of Ziyad”
2171 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      A man said: Messenger of Allah, I have a slave-girl and I withdraw the penis from her (while having intercourse), and I dislike that she becomes pregnant. I intend (by intercourse) what the men intend by it.       The Jews say that withdrawing the penis (azl) is burying the living girls on a small scale. He (the Prophet) said: The Jews told a lie. If Allah intends to create it, you cannot turn it away.
2172 | Muhairiz said “I entered the mosque and saw Abu Sa’id Al Khudri . I sat with him and asked about withdrawing the penis (while having intercourse). Abu Sa’id said We went out with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) on the expedition to Banu Al Mustaliq and took some Arab women captive and we desired the women for we were suffering from the absence of our wives and we wanted ransom, so we intended to withdraw the penis (while having intercourse with the slave women). But we asked ourselves “can we draw the penis when the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) is among us before asking him about it? So we asked him about it. He said “it does not matter if you do not do it, for very soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.”
2173 | Jabir said “A man from the Ansar came to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and said “I have a slave girl and I have intercourse with her. But I dislike her to conceive. He replied “Withdraw your penis from her if you wish for what is decreed for her will come to her.” After a time the man came to him and said “The girl has become pregnant”. He said “I told you that what was decreed for her would come to her.”
2174 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      AbuNadrah reported: An old man of Tufawah said to me: I was a guest of AbuHurayrah at Medina. I did not find any one of the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) more devoted to worship and more hospitable than AbuHurayrah.        One day I was with him when he was sitting on his bed. He had a purse which contained pebbles or kernels. A black slave-girl of his was sitting below. Counting them he was glorifying Allah. When the pebbles or the kernels in the purse were finished, she gathered them and put them again in the purse, and gave it to him. He said: Should I not tell you about me and about the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?        I said: Yes.  He said: Once when I was laid up with fever in the mosque, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and entered the mosque, and said: Who saw the youth of ad-Daws. He said this three times.        A man said: Messenger of Allah, there he is, laid up with fever on one side of the mosque. He moved, walking forward till he reached me. He placed his hand on me. He had a kind talk with me, and I rose. He then began to walk till he reached the place where he used to offer his prayer. He paid his attention to the people. There were two rows of men and one row of women, or two rows of women and one row of men (the narrator is doubtful).        He then said: If Satan makes me forget anything during the prayer, the men should glorify Allah, and the women should clap their hands. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then prayed and he did not forget anything during the prayer.        He said: Be seated in your places, be seated in your places. The narrator, Musa, added the word "here". He then praised Allah and exalted Him, and said: Now to our topic.        The agreed version begins: He then said: Is there any man among you who approaches his wife, closes the door, covers himself with a curtain, and he is concealed with the curtain of Allah?        They replied: Yes.  He said: later he sits and says: I did so-and-so; I did so-and-so. The people kept silence. He then turned to the women and said (to them): Is there any woman among you who narrates it? They kept silence. Then a girl fell on one of her knees. The narrator, Mu'ammil, said in his version: a buxom girl. She raised her head before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) so that he could see her and listen to her.        She said: Messenger of Allah, they (the men) describe the secrets (of intercourse) and they (the women) also describe the secrets (of intercourse) to the people.        He said: Do you know what the similitude is? He said: The likeness of this act is the likeness of a female Satan who meets the male Satan on the roadside; he fulfils his desire with her while the people are looking at him. Beware! The perfume of men is that whose smell becomes visible and its colour does not appear. Beware! The perfume of women is that whose colour becomes visible and whose smell is not obvious.        AbuDawud said: From here I remembered this tradition from Mu'ammil and Musa: Beware! No man should lie with another man, no woman should lie with another woman except with one's child or father. He also mentioned a third which I have forgotten. This has been mentioned in the version of Musaddad, but I do not remember it as precisely as I like.        The narrator, Musa, said: Hammad narrated this tradition from al-Jarir from AbuNadrah from at-Tufawi.
2175 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Anyone who incites a woman against her husband or a slave against his master is not one of us.
2176 | Abu Hurairah reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “A woman should not ask for the divorce of her sister to make her bowl vacant for her and to marry him. She will have what is decreed for her.”
2177 | Narrated Muharib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Allah did not make anything lawful more abominable to Him than divorce.
2178 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Of all the lawful acts the most detestable to Allah is divorce.
2179 | ‘Abd Allah bin Umar said that he divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the time of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). So ‘Umar bin Al Khattab asked the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about this matter. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Order him, he must take her back and keep her back till she is purified, then has another menstrual period and is purified. Thereafter if he desires he may divorce her before having intercourse with her, for that is the period of waiting which Allaah the Glorified has commanded for the divorce of women.”
2180 | The aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Nafi’ through a different chain of narrators. This version says Ibn ‘Umar divorced a wife of his while she was menstruating pronouncing one divorce. He then narrated the rest of the tradition similar to the one narrated by Malik.
2181 | Ibn ‘Umar said that he divorced his wife while she was menstruating. ‘Umar mentioned the matter to the Prophet(ﷺ). He (the Prophet) said “Order him, he must take her back and divorce her when she is purified (from menstrual discharge) or she is pregnant.”
2182 | ‘Abd Allah (bin Umar) said that he divorced his wife while she was menstruating. ‘Umar mentioned the matter to the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) became angry and said “Command him, he must take her back and keep her back till she is purified, then has another menstrual period and is purified. Then if he desires he may divorce her during the period of purity before he has intercourse with her. This is the divorce for waiting period as commanded by Allaah, the Exalted.
2183 | Yunus bin Jubair said that he asked Ibn ‘Umar “How many times did you pronounce divorce to your wife? He replied, once.”
2184 | Yunus bin Jubair said “I asked ‘Abd Allah bin ‘Umar “A man divorced his wife while she was menstruating? He said do you know ‘Abd Allah bin ‘Umar? He said, yes. ‘Abd Allah bin ‘Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating. So, ‘Umar came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked him (about this matter). He said Command him to take her back in marriage he may the divorce her in the beginning of the waiting period. I (Ibn Jubair) asked him “Will this divorce be counted? He said “Why not?” If he was helpless and showed his foolishness (that would have been counted).
2185 | Abdur Rahman ibn Ayman, the client of Urwah, asked Ibn Umar and Abu al-Zubayr was was listening:What do you think if a man divorces his wife while she is menstruating? He said: Abdullah ibn Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).So Umar asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: Abdullah ibn Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating. Abdullah said: He returned her to me and did not count it (the pronouncement) anything. He said: When she is purified, he may divorce her or keep her with him. Ibn Umar said: The Prophet (ﷺ) recited the Qur'anic verse: O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them in the beginning of their waiting period."   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Yunus b. Jubair, Anas b. Sirin b. Jubair, Zaid b. Aslam, Abu al-Zubair and Mansur from Abu Wa'il on the authority of Ibn 'Umar. They all agreed on the theme that the Prophet (ﷺ) commanded him to take her back (and keep her) till she was purified. Then if he desired, he might divorce her or keep her with him if he wanted to do so. The version narrated by al-Zuhri from Salim from Nafi' on the authority of Ibn 'Umar has: The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded him to take her back (and keep her) till she is purified, and then has menstrual discharge, and then she is purified. Then if he desires, he may divorce her and if he desires he may keep her.   Abu Dawud said: A version like that of Nafi' and al-Zuhri has also been transmitted by 'Ata al-Khurasani from al-Hasan on the authority of Ibn 'Umar. All the versions of this tradition contradict the one narrated by Abu al-Zubair.
2186 | Narrated Mutarrif ibn Abdullah:      Imran ibn Husayn was asked about a person who divorces his wife, and then has intercourse with her, but he does not call any witness to her divorce nor to her restoration. He said: You divorced against the sunnah and took her back against the sunnah. Call someone to bear witness to her divorce, and to her return in marriage, and do not repeat it.
2187 | Narrated Umar ibn Mu'tab:      Abu Hasan, a client of Banu Nawfal asked Ibn Abbas: A slave had a wife who was a slave-girl. He divorced her by two pronouncements. Afterwards both of them were freed. Is it permissible for him to ask her in marriage again? He said: Yes. This is a decision given by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
2188 | The aforesaid tradition (No. 2182) has also been transmitted by Ali (ibn al-Mubarak) through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.       This version adds:Ibn Abbas said: There remained one more pronouncement of divorce for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took the same decision.    Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: 'Abd al-Razzaq said that Ibn al-Mubarak said to Ma'mar: Who is this Abu al-Hasan ? He bore a big rock.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Zuhri has narrated (traditions) on the authority of this Abu al-Hasan. Al-Zuhri said: He was lawyer, and al-Zuhri narrated many traditions from Abu al-Hasan.   Abu Dawud said: Abu al-Hasan is well known narrator. This tradition is not practiced.
2189 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The divorce of a slave-woman consists in saying it twice and her waiting period is two menstrual courses (qur') AbuAsim said: A similar tradition has been narrated to me by Muzahir and al-Qasim on the authority of Aisha from the Prophet (ﷺ), except that he said: And her waiting period ('iddah) is two courses.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition is obscure.
2190 | 'Amr b. Shu'aib on his father's authority said that his grandfather (Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As):The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no divorce except in what you possess; there is no possession, there is no sale transaction till you possess. The narrator Ibn as-Sabbah added: There is no fulfilling a vow till you possess.
2191 | The above tradition has also been transmitted by ‘Amr bin Shu’aib through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version adds “If anyone swears an oath to do an act of disobedience to GOD, his oath is not valid, and if anyone swears an oath to sever relationship, his oath is not valid(i.e., he must not fulfill it)
2192 | The above tradition has also been transmitted by ‘Amr bin Shu’aib through a different chain of narrators. This version adds The Prophet (ﷺ) said “There is no vow except in an act which seeks the pleasure of Allah, the Exalted.
2193 | Muhammad ibn Ubayd ibn Abu Salih who lived in Ayliya said:I went out with Adi ibn Adi al-Kindi till we came to Mecca. He sent me to Safiyyah daughter of Shaybah who remembered a tradition (that she had heard) from Aisha. She said: I heard Aisha say: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: There is no divorce or emancipation in case of constraint or duress (ghalaq).   Abu Dawud said: I think ghalaq means anger.
2194 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There are three things which, whether undertaken seriously or in jest, are treated as serious: Marriage, divorce and taking back a wife (after a divorce which is not final)
2195 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah hath created in their wombs. This means that if a man divorced his wife he had the right to take her back in marriage though he had divorced her by three pronouncements. This was then repealed (by a Qur'anic verse). Divorce is only permissible twice.
2196 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Abd Yazid, the father of Rukanah and his brothers, divorced Umm Rukanah and married a woman of the tribe of Muzaynah. She went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: He is of no use to me except that he is as useful to me as a hair; and she took a hair from her head. So separate me from him. The Prophet (ﷺ) became furious. He called on Rukanah and his brothers. He then said to those who were sitting beside him. Do you see so-and-so who resembles Abdu Yazid in respect of so-and-so; and so-and-so who resembles him in respect of so-and-so? They replied: Yes. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Abdu Yazid: Divorce her. Then he did so. He said: Take your wife, the mother of Rukanah and his brothers, back in marriage. He said: I have divorced her by three pronouncements, Messenger of Allah. He said: I know: take her back. He then recited the verse: "O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed periods."   Abu Dawud said: The tradition narrated by Nafi' b. 'Ujair and 'Abd Allah b. Yazid b. Rukanah from his father on the authority of his grandfather reads: Rukanah divorced his wife absolutely (i.e. irrevocable divorce). The Prophet (ﷺ) restored her to him. This version is sounder (than other versions), for they (i.e. these narrators) are the children of his man, and the members of the family are more aware of his case. Rukanah divorced his wife absolutely (i.e. three divorces in one pronouncement) and the Prophet (ﷺ) made it a single divorce.
2197 | Mujahid said “I was with Ibn ‘Abbas”. A man came to him and said that he divorced his wife by three pronouncements. I kept silence and thought that he was going to restore het to him. He then said “A man goes and commits a foolish act and then says “O, Ibn ‘Abbas! Alaah has said “And for those who fear Allaah, He (ever) prepares a way out.” Since you did not keep duty to Allaah I do not find a way out for you. You disobeyed your Lord and your wife was separated from you. Allaah has said “O Prophet! When you divorce women divorce them in the beginning of their waiting period.”   Abu Dawud said “This tradition has been transmitted by Humaid Al A’raj and by others from Mujahid on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas. Shu’bjh narrated it from ‘Amr bin Murrah from Sa’id bin Jubair on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas. Ayyub and Ibn ‘Jubair both narrated it from “’Ikrimah bin Khalid from Sa’id bin Jubair on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas. Ibn Juraij narrated it from ‘Abd Al Hamid bin Rafi’ from ‘Ata from Ibn ‘Abbas. Al A’mash narrated it from Malik bin Al Harith on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas. They all said about the divorce by three pronouncements. He allowed it and said” (Your wife) has been separated from you similar to the tradition narrated by Isma’il from Ayub from ‘Abd Allaah bin Kathir.”   Abu Dawud said “Hammad bin Zaid narrated it from Ayyub from ‘Ikrimah on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas. This version adds If he said “You are divorced three times saying in one pronouncement, it constitutes a single (divorce). Isma’il bin Ibrahim narrated it from Ayyub from ‘Ikrimah. This is his (‘Ikrimah’s) statement. He did not mention the name of Ibn ‘Abbas. He narrated it as a statement of ‘Ikrimah.”
2198 | Abu Dawud said “The opinion of Ibn ‘Abbas has been mentioned in the following tradition. “Ahmad bin Salih and Muhammad bin Yahya narrated this is the version of Ahmad (bin Salih)” from ‘Abd Ar Razzaq from Ma’mar from Al Zuhri from Abu Salamah din Abd Al Rahman bin ‘Awf and Muhammad bin ‘Abd Al Rahman bin Thawban from Muhammad bin Iyas that Ibn ‘Abbas, Abu Hurairah and ‘Abd Alah bin ‘Amr bin Al ‘As were asked about a virgin who is divorced three times by her husband. They all said “She is not lawful for him until she marries a man other than her former husband.” Abu Dawud said “Malik narrated from Yahya bin Sa’id from Bukair bin Al Ashajj from Mu’awiyah bin Abi ‘Ayyash who was present on this occasion when Muhammad bin Iyas bin Al Bukair came to Ibn Al Zubair and Asim in ‘Umar. He asked them about this matter. They replied “Go to Ibn ‘Abbas and Abu Hurairah, I have left them with A’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). He then narrated the rest of the tradition.”   Abu Dawud said “The statement of Ibn ‘Abbas goes “The divorce by three pronouncements separates the wife from husband whether the marriage has been consummated or not, the previous husband is not lawful for her until she marries a man other than her husband”. This statement is like the tradition which deals with the exchange of money. In this tradition the narrator said “Ibn ‘Abbas withdrew his opinion.”"
2199 | Tawus said A man called Abu Al Sahba used to ask Ibn ‘Abbas questions frequently. He asked “Do you know that when a man divorced his wife by three pronouncement before sexual intercourse with her, they (the people) made it a single divorce during the time of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), of Abu Bakr and in the early phase of the caliphate of ‘Umar?” Ibn “Abbas said “Yes, when a man divorced his wife by three pronouncement before sexual intercourse they made it a single divorce during the time of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), of Abu Bakr and in the early phase of the caliphate of ‘Umar. When he saw that the people frequently divorced (by three pronouncements) he said “Make them operative on them (i.e., on women)”.
2200 | Tawus said:Abu al-Sahba' said to Ibn Abbas: Do you know that a divorce by three pronouncements was made a single one during the time of the Prophet (ﷺ), and of AbuBakr and in the early days of the caliphate of Umar? He replied: Yes.
2201 | ‘Umar bin Al Khattab reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “Actions are to be judged only by intentions and a man will have  only what he intended. When one’s emigration is to Allaah and His Apostle, his emigration is to Allaah and His Apostle but his emigration is to a worldly end at which he aims or to a woman whom he marries , his emigration is to that for which he emigrated.
2202 | ‘Abd Allah bin Ka’b reported “I heard Ka’ab bin Malik. He then narrated his story about the battle of Tabuk.(Narrating the story) he added “When forty out of fifty days passed”, the messenger of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) came and said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) has commanded you to keep away from your wife. He said “So, I (Ka’b bin Malik)” said “Should I divorce her or what should I do? He said “No, but only keep away from her and do not go near her”. So, I said to my wife “Go to your people and live with them until Allaah, the exalted makes a decision in this matter.”
2203 | A’ishah said The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) gave us our choice and we chose him so that was not reckoned anything (i.e., divorce)
2204 | Hammad ibn Zayd said:I asked Ayyub: Do you know anyone who narrates the tradition narrated by Al-Hasan about uttering the words (addressing wife). "Your matter is in your hand"? He replied: No, except something similar transmitted by Qatadah from Kathir, the client of Samurah, from AbuSalamah on the authority of AbuHurayrah from the Prophet (ﷺ). Ayyub said: Kathir then came to us; so I asked him (about this matter). He replied: I never narrated it. I mentioned it to Qatadah who said: Yes (he narrated it) but he forgot.
2205 | Qatadah reported on the authority of Al Hasan the uttering of the words “Your matter is in your hand” amounts to three pronouncements of divorce.
2206 | Nafi' bun Ujair bin Abd Yazid bin Ruknah reported Ruknah bin ‘Abd Yazid divorced his wife Suhaimah absolutely. The Prophet (ﷺ) was informed about this matter. He said to him (the Prophet) I swear by Allaah that I meant it to be only a single utterance of divorce. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “I swear by Allaah that I meant it to be only a single divorce. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) restored her to him, Then he divorced her the second time in the time of ‘Umar and the third time of ‘Uthman.   Abu Dawud said “This tradition contains the words of Ibrahim in its beginning and the words of Ibn Al Sarh in the end.
2207 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Rukanah bin Yazid from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators.
2208 | 'Ali b. Yazid b. Rukanah reported on the authority of his father from his grandfather that he  (Rukanah) divorced his wife absolutely; so he came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He asked (him):What did you intend? He said: A single utterance of divorce. He said: Do you swear by Allah? He replied: I swear by Allah. He said: It stands as you intended.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition is sounder than that of Ibn Juraij that Rukanah divorced his wife by three pronouncements, for they are the members of his family and they are more aware for him. The tradition of Ibn Juraij has been narrated by some children of Abu Rafi' from 'Ikrimah on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas.
2209 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying “Allah has ignored for my community what comes to their mind, so long as they do not act or pronounce words to that effect.”
2210 | Narrated Tamimah al-Hujayni:      A man said to his wife: O my younger sister! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)said: Is she your sister? He (the Prophet disliked it and prohibited saying so.
2211 | Abu Tamimah reported from a man of his tribe “The Prophet (ﷺ) heard a man say his wife “O my younger sister! So he prohibited him (addressing his wife in this manner)   Abu Dawud said “This tradition has also been transmitted by ‘Abd Al Aziz bin Al Mukhtar from Khalid from Abu ‘Uthman from Abu Thamimah from the Prophet (ﷺ). This has also been narrated by Shu’bah from Khalid from a man on the authority of Abu Thamimah from the Prophet (ﷺ).
2212 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet(ﷺ) as saying Abraham(peace be upon him) never told a lie except on three occasions twice for the sake of Allaah. Allaah quoted his words (in the Qur’an) “I am indeed sick” and “Nay, this was done by - this is their biggest one”. Once he was passing through the land of a tyrant (king). He stayed there in a place. People went to the tyrant and informed him saying “A man has come down here; he has a most beautiful woman with him.” So he sent for him (Abraham) and asked about her. He said she is my sister. When he returned to her, he said “he asked me about you and I informed him that you were my sister. Today there is no believer except me and you. You are my sister in the Book of Allaah (i.e., sister in faith). So do not belie me before him. The narrator then narrated the rest of the tradition.   Abu Dawud said “A similar tradition has also been narrated by Shu’aib bin Abi Hamza from Abi Al Zinad from Al A’raj on the authority of Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ).
2213 | Narrated Salamah ibn Sakhr al-Bayadi:      I was a man who was more given than others to sexual intercourse with women. When the month of Ramadan came, I feared lest I should have intercourse with my wife, and this evil should remain with me till the morning. So I made my wife like my mother's back to me till the end of Ramadan. But one night when she was waiting upon me, something of her was revealed. Suddenly I jumped upon her. When the morning came I went to my people and informed them about this matter.        I said: Go along with me to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        They said: No, by Allah. So I went to the Prophet (peace be upon him and informed him of the matter.        He said: Have you really committed it, Salamah?  I said: I committed it twice, Messenger of Allah. I am content with the Commandment of Allah, the Exalted; so take a decision about me according to what Allah has shown you.        He said: Free a slave.  I said: By Him Who sent you with truth, I do not possess a neck other than this: and I struck the surface of my neck.        He said: Then fast two consecutive months. I said: Whatever I suffered is due to fasting.        He said: Feed sixty poor people with a wasq of dates.        I said: By Him Who sent you with truth, we passed the night hungry; there was no food in our house.        He said: Then go to the collector of sadaqah of Banu Zurayq; he must give it to you. Then feed sixty poor people with a wasq of dates; and you and your family eat the remaining dates. Then I came back to my people, and said (to them): I found with you poverty and bad opinion; and I found with the Prophet (ﷺ) prosperity and good opinion. He has commanded me to give alms to you.        Ibn al-Ala' added: Ibn Idris said: Bayadah is a sub-clan of Banu Zurayq.
2214 | Narrated Khuwaylah, daughter of Malik ibn Tha'labah:      My husband, Aws ibn as-Samit, pronounced the words: You are like my mother. So I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), complaining to him about my husband.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) disputed with me and said: Remain dutiful to Allah; he is your cousin.        I continued (complaining) until the Qur'anic verse came down: "Certainly has Allah heard the speech of the one who argues with you, [O Muhammad], concerning her husband..." [58:1] till the prescription of expiation.        He then said: He should set free a slave.  She said: He cannot afford it.  He said: He should fast for two consecutive months.  She said: Messenger of Allah, he is an old man; he cannot keep fasts.  He said: He should feed sixty poor people.  She said: He has nothing which he may give in alms. At that moment an araq (i.e. date-basket holding fifteen or sixteen sa's) was brought to him.        I said: I shall help him with another date-basked ('araq).  He said: You have done well. Go and feed sixty poor people on his behalf, and return to your cousin.  The narrator said: An araq holds sixty sa's of dates.   Abu Dawud said: She atoned on his behalf without seeking his permission.   Abu Dawud said: This man (Aws b. al-Samit) is the brother of 'Ubadah b. al-Samit.
2215 | A similar tradition has been transmitted by Ibn Ishaq with a different chain of narrators. But in this version he said ‘Araq is a date-basket holding thirty sa’s.   Abu Dawud said “This version is sounder than that of Yahya bin Adam.”
2216 | Another version transmitted by Abu Salamah bin ‘Abd Al Rahman has ‘Araq is a date-basket holding fifteen sa’s.
2217 | The tradition mentioned above has been transmitted by Sulaiman bin Yasar. This version has “Then some dates were brought to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and he gave it him. They measured about fifteen sa’s “. He said “Give them in alms”. He said “Is there anyone needier than I and my family. Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)?” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Eat them, you and your family.”
2218 | Abu Dawud said “I recited to Muhammad bin Wazir Al Misri and said to him Bishr bin Bakr narrated it to you and Al Auza’i narrated it to us. And he said “At’a narrated it to us on the authority of Aus brother of ‘Ubadah bin Al Samit. The Prophet (ﷺ) gave him fifteen sa’s of wheat to feed sixty poor people.   Abu Dawud said At’a did not meet Aws (bin Al Samit) who was one of the people of Badr and died in the early days of Islam. This version is therefore, mursal (i.e., a successor narrated it directly from the Prophet (ﷺ), the link of the Companions is missing). This has been narrated by Al Auza’i from At’a from Aus.
2219 | Narrated Hisham b. 'Urwah:      Khawlah was the wife of Aws ibn as-Samit; he was a man immensely given to sexual intercourse. When his desire for intercourse was intensified, he made his wife like his mother's back. So Allah, the Exalted, sent down Qur'anic verses relating to expiation for zihar.
2220 | A similar tradition has been transmitted by A’ishah through a different chain of narrators.
2221 | Narrated Ikrimah:      A man made his wife like the back of his mother. He then had intercourse with her before he atoned for it. He came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and informed him of this matter. He asked (him): What moved you to the action you have committed? He replied: I saw the whiteness of her shins in moon light. He said: Keep away from her until you expiate for your deed.
2222 | ‘Ikrimah said “A man made his wife like the back of his mother. When he saw the illumination of her shin in the moonlight, he had intercourse with her. He came to the Prophet (ﷺ). He ordered him to atone for it.
2223 | A similar tradition has been transmitted by Ibn ‘Abbas from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators. This version does not mention the word “shin”.
2224 | A tradition similar to that of Sufyan has been transmitted by ‘Ikrimah from the Prophet(ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators.
2225 | Abu Dawud said “I heard Muhammad bin Isa narrating this tradition who said Mu’tamar narrated it to us. And he (Mu’tamar) said “ I heard Al Hakam bin Aban narrating this tradition. He did not mention the name of Ibn ‘Abbas.   Abu Dawud said “Al Hussain bin Huraith wrote to me saying “Al Fadl bin Musa narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas to the same effect from the Prophet(ﷺ).
2226 | Narrated Thawban:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If any woman asks her husband for divorce without some strong reason, the odour of Paradise will be forbidden to her.
2227 | Amrah, daughter of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa'd ibn Zurarah, reported on the authority of Habibah, daughter of Sahl al-Ansariyyah:She (Habibah) was the wife of Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shimmas. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out one morning and found Habibah by his door.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who is this?  She replied: I am Habibah, daughter of Sahl. He asked: What is your case?  She replied: I and Thabit ibn Qays, referring to her husband, cannot live together.        When Thabit ibn Qays came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: This is Habibah, daughter of Sahl, and she has mentioned (about you) what Allah wished to mention.        Habibah said: Messenger of Allah, all that he gave me is with me.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Thabit ibn Qays: Take it from her. So he took it from her, and she lived among her people (relatives).
2228 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Habibah daughter of Sahl was the wife of Thabit ibn Qays Shimmas He beat her and broke some of her part. So she came to the Prophet (ﷺ) after morning, and complained to him against her husband. The Prophet (ﷺ) called on Thabit ibn Qays and said (to him): Take a part of her property and separate yourself from her. He asked: Is that right, Messenger of Allah? He said: Yes. He said: I have given her two gardens of mine as a dower, and they are already in her possession. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Take them and separate yourself from her.
2229 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The wife of Thabit ibn Qays separated herself from him for a compensation. The Prophet (ﷺ) made her waiting period a menstrual course.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by 'Abd al-Razzaq from Ma'mar from 'Amr b. Muslim from 'Ikrimah from the Prophet (ﷺ) in a mursal form (i.e. missing the link of the Companion).
2230 | Ibn ‘Umar said “The waiting period of a woman who separates herself from her husband for compensation is a menstrual period.”
2231 | Ibn ‘Abbas said “Mughith was a slave.” He said “Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) make intercession for me to her (Barirah)”. The Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) said “O Barirah fear Allaah. He is your husband and father of your child”. She said “Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) do you command me for that? He said No, I am only interceding. Then tears were falling down on his (her husband’s) cheeks. The Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) said to ‘Abbas “Are you not surprised with the love of Mughith for Barirah and her hatred for him.”
2232 | Ibn ‘Abbas said “The husband of Barirah was a black slave called Mughith. The Prophet (ﷺ) gave her choice and commanded her to observe the waiting period.”
2233 | While relating the tradition about Barirah A’ishah said “her husband was a slave, so the Prophet(ﷺ) gave her choice. She chose herself. Had he been a free man, he would not given her choice.”
2234 | A’ishah said “The Prophet (ﷺ) gave her choice. Her husband was a slave.”
2235 | A’ishah said “Barirah’s husband was a free man when she was emancipated. She was given choice. She said “I do not like to remain with him. I have such and such (grievances)”
2236 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Barirah was emancipated, and she was the wife of Mughith, a slave of Aal AbuAhmad. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave her choice, and said to her: If he has intercourse with you, then there is no choice for you.
2237 | Al-Qasim said:Aisha intended to set free two slaves of her who were spouses. She, therefore, asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about this matter. He commanded to begin with the man before the woman. The narrator Nasr said: Abu 'Ali al-Hanafi reported it to me on the authority of Ubaydullah.
2238 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A man came after embracing Islam during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Afterwards his wife came after embracing Islam. He said: Messenger of Allah, she embraced Islam along with me; so restore her to me.
2239 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A woman embraced Islam during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); she then married. Her (former) husband then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, I have already embraced Islam, and she had the knowledge about my Islam. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took her away from her latter husband and restored her to her former husband.
2240 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) restored his daughter Zaynab to Abul'As on the basis of the previous marriage, and he did not do anything afresh.    Muhammad b. 'Amr said in his version: After six years. Al-Hasan b. 'Ali said: After two years.
2241 | Narrated Al-Harith ibn Qays al-Asadi:      I embraced Islam while I had eight wives. So I mentioned it to the Prophet (ﷺ). The Prophet (said) said: Select four of them.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been narrated to us by Ahmad b. Ibrahim from Hushaim. He said: Qais b. al-Harith instead of al-Harith b. Qais. Ahmad b. Ibrahim said: This is correct, i.e. Qais b. al-Harith.
2242 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Qais bin Al Harith through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.
2243 | Al-Dahhak b. Firuz reported on the authority of his father:I said: Messenger of Allah, I have embraced Islam and two sisters are my wives. He said: Divorce any one of them you wish.
2244 | 'Abd al-Hamid ibn Ja'far reported from his father on the authority of his grandfather Rafi' ibn Sinan that he (Rafi' ibn Sinan) embraced Islam and his wife refused to embrace Islam. She came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said:My daughter; she is weaned or about to wean. Rafi' said: My daughter. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: Be seated on a side. And he said to her: Be seated on a side. He then seated the girl between them, and said to them: Call her. The girl inclined to her mother. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: O Allah! guide her. The daughter then inclined to her father, and he took her.
2245 | Sahl bin Sa’ad Al Sa’idi said that ‘Uwaimir bin Ashqar Al Ajilani came to ‘Asim bin Adl and said to him “Asim tell me about a man who finds a man along with his wife. Should he kill him and then be killed by you, or how should he act? Ask the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) ‘Asim, for me about it. ‘Asim then asked the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about it. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) disliked the question and denounced it. What ‘Asim heard from the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) fell heavy on him. When ‘Asim returned to his family ‘Uwaimr came to him and asked ‘Asim “What did the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) say to you”? Asim replied “You did not do good to me”. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) disliked the question that I asked him. Thereupon ‘Uwaimir said “I swear by Allaah, I shall not leave until I ask him about it. So, ‘Uwaimir came to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) while he was sitting in the midst of the people.” He said “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) tell me about a man who finds a man along with his wife. Should he kill him and then be killed by you, or how should he act?” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “A revelation has been sent down about you and your wife so go away and bring her. Sahl said “So we cursed one another while I was along with the people who were with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). Then when they finished, ‘Umamir said “I shall have lied against her, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) if I keep her. He pronounced her divorce three times before the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)commanded him (to do so).   Ibn Shihab said “Then this became the method of invoking curses.”
2246 | ‘Abbas bin Sahl reported on the authority of his father “The Prophet (ﷺ) said to ‘Asim bin ‘Adl. Keep the woman with you till she begets the child.
2247 | Sahl bin Sa’d Al Sa’idi said “I attended the invoking of the curses with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when I was fifteen. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. In this version he said “She then came out pregnant and the child was ascribed to its mother.
2248 | Sahl bin Sa’ad reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying  - in the tradition of spouses who invoked curses to each other “Look if she bears a child which has very black eyes, large buttocks, I cannot but imagine that  he (i.e., ‘Uwaimir) has spoken the truth. But, if she bears a reddish child like the lizard with red spots (waharah), I cannot imagine that ‘Uwaimir has lied against her. She gave birth to a child (like that described the Prophet (ﷺ) ) in a detestable manner.
2249 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Sahl bin Sa’d Al Sa’idi through a different chain of narrators. This version adds the child was attributed to its mother.
2250 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Sahl bin Sa’d Al Sa’idi through a different chain of narrators. This version has “He divorced her three times before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) implemented it and what is done before the Prophet (ﷺ) is sunnah(model behavior of the Prophet).   Sahl said “I attended this before the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ). Afterwards the sunnah about those who invoked curses on each other was established that they (the spouses) were separated from each other and they would never be united.”
2251 | Sahl bin Sa’ad said “The version of Musaddad has “I witnessed the invoking of curses by the two spouses during the life time of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) when I was fifteen years old. When they finished invoking curses, the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) separated them from each other. Here ends the version of Musaddad. Others said “He was present when the Prophet (ﷺ) separated the spouses who invoked curses on each other. The man (Sahl) said “I shall have lied against her, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) if I keep her.   Abu Dawud said “Some narrators did not mention the word ‘alaiha(against her).”   Abu Dawud said “No one supported Ibn ‘Uyainah that he separated the spouses who invoked curses.”
2252 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Sahl bin Sa’d through a different chain of narrators.  This version has “She was pregnant, he denied pregnancy from him. So her son was attributed to her. In the law of succession the practice (sunnah) was established that the son gets a share in the inheritance of his mother and the mother gets the share in the inheritance of her son according to the shares prescribed by Allaah the Exalted.
2253 | ‘Abd Allah (bin Mas’ud) said “We were in the mosque on the night of a Friday, suddenly a man from the Ansar entered the mosque”. And said “If a man finds a man along with wife and declares (about her adultery) you will flog him. Or if he kills you, you will kill him or if keeps silence he will keep silence in anger. I swear by Allaah, I shall ask the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about it”. On the next day he came to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and said “If a man finds a man along with wife and declares (about her adultery) you will flog him. Or if he kills you, you will kill him or if keeps silence he will keep silence in anger.” He said “O Allaah, disclose”. He kept on praying until the verses regarding invoking curses (li’an) came down “As for those who accuse their wives but have no witnesses except themselves.” So, the man was first involved in this trial among the people. He and his wife came to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). They invoked curses on each other. The man bore witness before Allaah four times that the thing he said was indeed true. He then invoked curse of Allaah on him for the fifth time if he was a liar. She then wanted to invoke curses of Allaah on him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said “Do not do that. Bust she refused and did so (i.e., invoked curses). When they returned he said “Perhaps she will give birth to a black child with curly hair.
2254 | Ibn ‘Abbas said “Hilal bin Umayyah accused his wife in the presence of Prophet (ﷺ) of having committed adultery with Sharik bin Sahma’”. The Prophet (ﷺ) said “Produce evidence or you must receive punishment on your back.” He said “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) when one of us sees a man having intercourse with his wife should he go and seek evidence?” But the Prophet (ﷺ) merely said “You must produce evidence or you must receive punishment on your back.” Hilal then said “By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I am speaking Truly. May Allaah send down something which will free my back from punishment. Then the following Qur’anic verses were revealed “And those who make charges against their spouses but have no witnesses except themselves” reciting till he reached “one of those who speak the truth”. The Prophet (ﷺ) then returned and sent for them and they came (to him). Hilal bin Umayyah stood up and testified and the Prophet (ﷺ) was saying “Allaah knows that one of you is lying. Will one of you repent?” Then the woman got up and testified, but when she was about to do it a fifth time saying that Allaah’s anger be upon her if he was one of those who spoke the truth, they said to her “this is the deciding one”. Ibn ‘Abbas said “She then hesitated and drew back so that we thought the she would withdraw(what she said) “Look and see whether she gives birth to a child with eyes looking as if they have antimony in them, wide buttocks and fat legs, if she did. Sharik bin Sahma’ will be its father. She then gave birth to a child of a similar description. The Prophet (ﷺ) thereupon said “If it were not for what has already been stated in Allaah’s book I would have dealt severely with her.”   Abu Dawud said “This tradition has been transmitted by the people of Medina alone. They narrated the tradition of Hilal on the authority of Ibn Bashshar.”
2255 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered a man and his wife to invoke curses on each other, he ordered a man to put his hand on his mouth when he came to the fifth utterance, saying that it would be the deciding one.
2256 | Ibn ‘Abbas said “Hilal bin Umayyah was one of the three persons whose repentance was accepted by Allaah. One night he returned from his land and found a man along with his wife. He witnessed with his eyes and heard with his ears. He did not threaten him till the morning.” Next day he went to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) in the morning and said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) “I came to my wife in the night and found a man along with her. I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) disliked what he described and he took it seriously. There upon the following Qur’anic verse came down “And those who make charges against their spouses but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them ....” When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) came to himself (after the revelation ended) he said “Glad tidings to you Hilal, Allaah the exalted has made ease and a way out for you.” Hilal said “I expected that from my Lord. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Send for her. She then came.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) recited the verses to them and he reminded them and told them that the punishment in the next world was more severe than that in n this world. Hilal said “I swear by Allah I spoke the truth against her.” She said “He told a lie.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Apply the method of invoking curses on one another. Hilal was told “Bear witness. So he bore witness before Allaah four times that he spoke the truth.” When he was about to utter the fifth time he was told “Hilal fear Allah, for the punishment in this world is easier than that in the next world and this is the deciding one, that will surely cause punishment to you.” He said “I swear by Allaah. Allah will not punish me for this (act), as He did not cause me to be flogged for this (act).” So he bore witness a fifth time invoking the curse of Allah on him if he was of those who tell a lie.  Then the people said to her, Testify. So she gave testimony before Allaah that he was a liar. When she was going to testify the fifth time she was told “Fear Allah, for the punishment in this world is easier than that in the next world. This is the deciding one that will surely cause punishment to you.” She hesitated for a moment. And then said “By Allah, I will not disgrace my people.” So she testified a fifth time invoking the curse of Allah on her if he spoke the truth.  Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) separated them from each other and decided that the child will not be attributed to its father. Neither she nor her child will be accused of adultery. He who accuses her or her child will be liable to punishment. He also decided that there will be no dwelling and maintenance for her (from the husband) as they were separated without divorce and death. He then said “If she gives birth to a child with reddish hair, light buttocks, wide belly and light shins he will be the child of Hilal. If she bears a dusky child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttocks he will be the child of the one who was accused of adultery. She gave birth to a child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttocks. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Had there been no oaths, I would have dealt with her severely.”   ‘Ikrimah said “Later on he became the chief of the tribe of Mudar. He was not attributed to his father.”
2257 | Ibn ‘Umar said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said to the spouses who invoked curses on each other. Your reckoning is in Allaah’s hands for one of you is liar there is no way for you to (remarry) her. He then asked Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) what about my property? He replied “There is no property for you. If you have spoken the truth, it is the price for your having had the right to intercourse with her and if you have lied against her it is still more remote for you.
2258 | Sa’d bin Jubair said I asked Ibn ‘Umar A man accused his wife of adultery? He said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) separated the brother and the sister of Banu Al ‘Ajilan (i.e., husband and wife). He said Allaah knows that one of you is a liar, will one of you repent? He repeated these words three times, but they refused. So he separated them from each other.
2259 | Ibn ‘Umar said A man invoked curses on his wife (charging her of adultery) during the time of Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and disowned the child. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) therefore separated them and attributed the child to the woman. Abu Dawud said “The words narrated by Malik alone are “and he attributed the child to the woman.”"   Abu Dawud said:The words narrated by Malik alone are: "and he attributed the child to the woman."   Yunus narrated from Al Zuhri on the authority of Sahl bin Sa’d in the tradition regarding li’an(invoking curses). He disowned her conception hence her child was attributed to her.
2260 | Abu Hurairah said A man from Banu Fazarah came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said “My wife has given birth to a black son”. He said “Have you any camels?” He said “They are red”. He asked “Is there a dusky one among them?” He replied “Some of them are dusky”. He asked “How do you think they have come about?” He replied “This may be a strain to which they reverted”. He said “And this is perhaps a strain to which the child has reverted.”
2261 | The tradition mentioned above has also been narrated by Al Zuhri through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.  This version adds “At that time he was hinting at disowning the child.”
2262 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      A bedouin came to the Prophet (ﷺ), and said: My wife has given birth to a black son, and I disown him. He then narrated the rest of the tradition to the same effect.
2263 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      AbuHurayrah heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say when the verse about invoking curses came down: Any woman who brings to her family one who does not belong to it has nothing to do with Allah (i.e. expects no mercy from Allah), and Allah will not bring her into His Paradise.       Allah, the Exalted, will veil Himself from any man who disowns his child when he looks at him, and disgrace him in the presence of all creatures, first and last.
2264 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no prostitution in Islam. If anyone practised prostitution in pre-Islamic times, the child will be attributed to the master (of the slave-woman). He who claims his child without a valid marriage or ownership will neither inherit nor be inherited.
2265 | 'Amr b. Shu'aib on his father's authority said that his grandfather reported:The Prophet (ﷺ) decided regarding one who was treated as a member of a family after the death of his father, to whom he was attributed when the heirs said he was one of them, that if he was the child of a slave-woman whom the father owned when he had intercourse with her, he was included among those who sought his inclusion, but received none of the inheritance which was previously divided; he, however, received his portion of the inheritance which had not already been divided; but if the father to whom he was attributed had disowned him, he was not joined to the heirs.       If he was a child of a slave-woman whom the father did not possess or of a free woman with whom he had illicit intercourse, he was not joined to the heirs and did not inherit even if the one to whom he was attributed is the one who claimed paternity, since he was a child of fornication whether his mother was free or a slave.
2266 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Muhammad bin Rashid through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.  This version adds “he is the child of fornication for the people of his mother whether she was free or a slave. This attribution of a child to the parents was practiced in the beginning of Islam. The property divided before Islam will not be taken into account.
2267 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered  upon me. The version of Musaddad and Ibn as-Sarh has: one day looking pleased". The version of Uthman has: "The lines of his forehead were realised." He said: O Aisha, are you not surprised to hear that Mujazziz al-Mudlaji saw that Zayd and Usamah had a rug over them concerning their heads and letting their feet appear. He said: These feet are related.    Abu Dawud: Usamah was black and Zaid was white.
2268 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by ibn Shihab through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.  This version adds “She said “he entered upon me looking pleased with the lines of his face brightened.    Abu Dawud said “Ibn ‘Uyainah did not remember the words “the lines of his face”.”   Abu Dawud said “The words “the lines of his face” have been narrated by Ibn ‘Uyainah himself. He did not hear Al Zuhri say (these words). He heard some person other than Al Zuhri say these words. The words “the lines of his face” occur in the tradition narrated by Al Laith and others.   Abu Dawud said “ I heard Ahmad bin Salih say “Usamah was very black like tar and Zaid was white like cotton.”
2269 | Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam:      I was sitting with the Prophet (ﷺ). A man came from the Yemen, and said: Three men from the people of the Yemen came to Ali, quarrelling about a child, asking him to give a decision. They had had sexual intercourse with a woman during a single state of purity.        He said to two of them: Give this child to this man (the third person) with pleasure. But they (refused and) cried loudly. Again he said to two of them: Give the child to the man (the third person) willingly. But they (refused and) cried loudly. He then said: You are quarrelsome partners. I shall cast lots among you; he who receives the lot, will acquire the child, and he shall pay two-thirds of the blood-money to both his companions. He then cast lots among them, and gave the child to the one who received the lot. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) laughed so much that his canine or molar teeth appeared.
2270 | Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam:      Three persons were brought to Ali (Allah be pleased with him) when he was in the Yemen. They and sexual intercourse with a woman during a single state of purity. He asked two of them: Do you acknowledge this child for this (man)? They replied: No. He then put this (question) to all of them. Whenever he asked two of them, they replied in the negative. He, therefore, cast a lot among them, and attributed the child to the one who received the lot. He imposed two-third of the blood-money (i.e. the price of the mother) on him. This was then mentioned to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he laughed so much that his molar teeth appeared.
2271 | Khalil or Ibn Khalil said “A woman was brought to Ali bin Abi Talib(may Allaah be pleased with him). She bore a child from intercourse of three persons. The narrator transmitted the rest of the tradition similar to the previous one. But in this version he did not mention “Yemen” and the Prophet (ﷺ) and his words “give the child willingly.”
2272 | A’ishah wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) said “Marriage in pre Islamic times was of four kinds.” One of them was the marriage contracted by the people today. A man asked another man to marry his relative (sister or daughter) to him. He fixed the dower and married her to him. Another kind of marriage was that a man asked his wife when she became pure from menstruation to send fro so and so and have sexual intercourse with him. Her husband kept himself aloof and did not have intercourse with her till It became apparent that she was pregnant from the man who had intercourse with her. When it was manifest that she was pregnant, her husband approached her if he liked. This marriage was called istibda’(to utilize man for intercourse for a noble birth). A third kind of marriage was that a group of people less than ten in number entered upon a woman and had intercourse with her. When she conceived gave birth to a child and a number of days passed after her delivery, she sent for them. No one of them could refuse to attend and they gathered before her. She said to them “You have realized your affair. I have now given birth to a child. And this is your son.  O so and so. She called the name of anyone of them she liked and the child was attributed to him. A fourth kind of marriage was that many people gathered together and entered upon a woman who did not prevent anyone who came to her. They were prostitutes. They hoisted flags at their doors which served as a sign for the one who intended to enter upon them. When she became pregnant and delivered the child , they got together before her and called for the experts of tracing relationship from physical features. They attributed the child to whom they considered and it was given to him. The child was called his son and he could not deny. When Allah sent Muhammad (ﷺ) as a Prophet, he abolished all kinds of marriages prevalent among the people of the pre Islamic times except of the Muslims practiced today.
2273 | A’ishah said “Sa’d bin Abi Waqqas and ‘Abd bin Zamah disputed amongst themselves about the (relationship of the) son of the slave girl of Zam’ah and brought the case to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). Sa’d said “My brother ‘Utbah enjoined me that when I came to Makkah I should see the son of the slave girl of Zam’ah and take his possession for that is his son”. ‘Abd bin Zam’ah said “He is my brother, the son of my father’s slave girl having been born on my father’s bed”. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) saw his clear resemblance to ‘Utbah. So he said “The child is attributed to the one on whose bed it is born and the fornicator is deprived of any right (lit. the fornicator will have the stone). Veil yourself from him, Saudah. Musaddad added in his version “he is your brother ‘Abd”.
2274 | 'Amr b. Shu'aib on his father's authority said that his grandfather reported:A man got up and said: Messenger of Allah, so-and-so is my son; I had illicit intercourse with his mother in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is no unlawful claiming of paternity in Islam. What was done in pre-Islamic times has been annulled. The child is attributed to the one on whose bed it is born, and the fornicator is deprived of any right.
2275 | Rabah said:My people married me to a Roman slave-girl of theirs. I had intercourse with her, and she gave birth to a black (male) child like me. I named it Abdullah. I again had intercourse with her, and she gave birth to a black (male) child like me. I named it Ubaydullah. Then a Roman slave of my people, called Yuhannah, incited her, and spoke to her in his own unintelligible language. She gave birth to a son like a chameleon (red).        I asked her: What is this?  She replied: This belongs to Yuhannah. We then brought the case to Uthman (for a decision). I think Mahdi said these words. He inquired from both of them, and they acknowledged (the facts).        He then said to them: Do you agree that I take the decision about you, which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had taken? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) decided that the child was to attributed to the one on whose bed it was born. And I think he said: He flogged her and flogged him, for they were slaves.
2276 | 'Amr b. Shu'aib on his father's authority said that his grandfather (Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As) reported:A woman said: Messenger of Allah, my womb is a vessel to this son of mine, my breasts, a water-skin for him, and my lap a guard for him, yet his father has divorced me, and wants to take him away from me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You have more right to him as long as you do not marry.
2277 | Hilal ibn Usamah quoted Abu Maimunah Salma, client of the people of Medina, as saying:While I was sitting with AbuHurayrah, a Persian woman came to him along with a son of hers. She had been divorced by her husband and they both claimed him.        She said: AbuHurayrah, speaking to him in Persian, my husband wishes to take my son away.        AbuHurayrah said: Cast lots for him, saying it to her in a foreign language.        Then her husband came and asked: Who is disputing with me about my son?        AbuHurayrah said: O Allah, I do not say this, except that I heard a woman who came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while I was sitting with him, and she said: My husband wishes to take away my son, Messenger of Allah, and he draws water for me from the well of AbuInabah, and he has been good to me.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Cast lots for him.  Her husband said: Who is disputing with me about my son?  The Prophet (ﷺ) said: This is your father and this your mother, so take whichever of them you wish by the hand. So he took his mother's hand and she went away with him.
2278 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      Zayd ibn Harithah went out to Mecca and brought the daughter of Hamzah with him. Then Ja'far said: I shall take her; I have more right to her; she is my uncle's daughter and her maternal aunt is my wife; the maternal aunt is like mother. Ali said: I am more entitled to take her. She is my uncle's daughter. The daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is my wife, and she has more right to her. Zayd said: I have more right to her. I went out and journeyed to her, and brought her with me. The Prophet (ﷺ) came out.       The narrator mentioned the rest of the tradition. He (i.e. the Prophet) said: As for the girl, I decided in favour of Ja'far. She will live with her maternal aunt. The maternal aunt is like mother.
2279 | This tradition has been narrated by ‘Abd Al Rahman bin Abi Laila through a different chain of narrators. This version has “He decided that she would be given to Ja’far and said “Her maternal aunt is with him(i.e., his wife).
2280 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      When we came out from Mecca, Hamzah's daughter pursued us crying: My uncle. Ali lifted her and took her by the hand. (Addressing Fatimah he said:) Take your uncle's daughter. She then lifted her. The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition. Ja'far said: She is my uncle's daughter. Her maternal aunt is my wife. The Prophet (ﷺ) decided in favour of her maternal aunt, and said: The maternal aunt is like mother.
2281 | Amr ibn Muhajir reported on the authority of his father:Asma', daughter of Yazid ibn as-Sakan al-Ansariyyah, was divorced in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). No waiting period was prescribed for a divorced woman (at that time). When Asma' was divorced, Allah, the Exalted, sent down the injunction of waiting period for divorce. She is the first of the divorced women about whom the verse relating to waiting period was sent down.
2282 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart, three monthly courses; and then said: And for such of your women as despair of menstruation, if ye doubt, their period (of waiting) shall be three months. This was abrogated from the former verse. Again he said: (O ye who believe, if ye wed believing women) and divorce them before ye have touched them, then there is no period that ye should reckon."
2283 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      The Prophet (ﷺ) divorced Hafsah, but he took her back in marriage.
2284 | Abu Salamah bin ‘Abd Al Rahman reported on the authority of Fatimah daughter of Qais Abu ‘Amr bin Hafs divorced her (Fatimah daughter of Qais) absolutely when he was away from home and his agent sent her home barley. She was displeased with it. He said “I swear by Allah, you have no claim on us. She then came to Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. He said to her “No maintenance is due to you from him. He ordered her to spend the waiting period in the house of Umm Sharik but he said afterwards “that is a woman whom my Companions visit. Spend the waiting period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum for he is blind and you can undress. Then when you are in a position of being remarried, tell me.” She said “When I was in a position to remarry, I mentioned to him that Mu’awiyah bin Abi Sufyan and Abu Jahm had asked me in marriage. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ)said “As for Abu Jahm, he does not put down his stick from his shoulder, and as for Mu’awiyah he is a poor man who has no property; marry Usamah bin Zaid. I disliked him but he said “Marry Usamah bin Zaid. So, I married him. And Allah prospered him very much and I was envied.”
2285 | Abu Salamah bin ‘Abd Al Rahman said that Fatimah daughter of Qais told him that Abu Hafs Al Mughirah divorced her three times. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. The version has Khalid bin Walid and some people of Banu Makhzum came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said Prophet of Allaah (ﷺ) Abu Hafs Al Mughirah divorced his wife three times and he has left a little for her. He said “No maintenance is necessary for her. He then transmitted the rest of the tradition. The tradition narrated by Malik is more perfect.
2286 | Abu Salamah reported on the authority of Fatimah daughter of Qais that Abu ‘Amr bin Hafs Al Makhzumi divorced her three times. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. He then mentioned about Khalid bin Walid and said that the Prophet (ﷺ) said “There are no maintenance and dwelling for her.” This version has “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) sent a message to her “Do not give her consent for marriage without my permission.””
2287 | Fatimah daughter of Qais said “I was married to a man of Banu Makhzum. He divorced me absolutely. The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition like that of Malik. This version has “Do not marry yourself without my permission.”   Abu Dawud said Al Sha’bi, Al Bahiyy and ata from abd Al Rahman bin asim and Abu Bakr bin Abi Al Jahm all narrated on the authority of Fatimah daughter of Qais that her husband had divorced her three times.
2288 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Al Sha’bi through a different chain of narrators.  This version has “The husband of Fathima daughter of Qais pronounced her triple divorce. The Prophet (ﷺ) did not allow her to have maintenance and dwelling.”
2289 | Abu Salamah reported on the authority of Fatimah daughter of Qays who said to him that she was the wife of AbuHafs ibn al-Mughirah who divorced her by three pronouncements. She said that she came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and sought his opinion about her going out from her house. He commanded her to shift to (the house of )Ibn Umm Maktum who was blind. Marwan denied to confirm the tradition of Fatimah about the going out of a divorced woman from her house. Urwah said:Aisha objected to Fatimah daughter of Qays.    Abu Dawud said: Salih b. Kaisan, Ibn Juraij, and Shu'aib b. Abi Hamzah -- all of them narrated on the authority of al-Zuhru in a similar way.    Abu Dawud said: Shu'aibn b. Abi Hamzah the name of Abu Hamzah is Dinar. He is a client of Ziyad.
2290 | ‘Ubaid Allah said “Marwan sent someone (Qabisah) to Fatimah and asked her (about  the case). She said that she was the wife of Abu Hafs. The Prophet (ﷺ) appointed ‘Ali as governor in a certain part of Yemen. Her husband also proceeded with him. From there he sent a message to her pronouncing one divorce that had yet remained. He commanded ‘Ayyash bin Abi Rabi’ah and Al Harith bin Hisham to provide maintenance to her. They said “By Allah there is no sustenance for her except in case she is pregnant.” She came to the Prophet(ﷺ) who said “There is no sustenance for you except in case you are pregnant. She then asked permission to shift (from her house) and he gave her permission.” She asked “Where should I shift. Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)? The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said to Ibn Umm Maktum . He was blind. She would undress herself and he could not see her. She lived there till her waiting period passed. The Prophet (ﷺ) married her to Usamah. Qabisah then returned to Marwan and narrated that to him. Marwan said “We did not hear this tradition except from a woman, so we shall follow the reliable practice on which we found the people”. When this reached Fatimah she said “between me and you is the Book of Allah”. Allaah the exalted said “Divorce them for their waiting period...” Thou knowest not it may be that Allaah will afterward bring some new thing to pass. She said “What a new thing will emerge after triple divorce.”   Abu Dawud said “A similar tradition has been narrated by Yunus on the authority of Al Zuhri. As for Al Zubaidi he narrated both traditions, the tradition of ‘Ubaid Allah in the version of Ma’mar and the tradition of Abu  Salamah in the version of ‘Aqil.”   Abu Dawud said “Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated on the authority of Al Zuhri that Qabisah bin Dhuwaib transmitted to him the version which was narrated by ‘Ubaid Allah bin ‘Abd Allaah which has Qabisah then returned to Marwan and informed him about that.”
2291 | Abu Ishaq said “I was with Al Aswad in the congregational mosque. He said “Fathimah daughter of Qais came to ‘Umar bin Al Khattab(may Allaah be pleased with him). (When she narrated the tradition about her divorce) he said “We are not to leave the Book of our Lord and the Sunnah of our Prophet (ﷺ) for the statement of a woman, we do not know whether she remembered it or not.”
2292 | Urwah said:Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) severely objected to the tradition of Fatimah daughter of Qays. She said: Fatimah lived in a desolate house and she feared for her loneliness there. Hence the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) accorded permission to her (to leave the place).
2293 | Urwah ibn az-Zubayr said:Aisha was asked: Did you not see (i.e. known) the statement of Fatimah? She replied: It is not good for her to mention it (to others).
2294 | Sulaimah bin Yasar said about leaving the house by Fathimah “That was due to her bad manners.”
2295 | Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad and Sulayman ibn Yasar reported:Yahya ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As divorced the daughter of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Hakam absolutely. 'Abd al-Rahman shifted her (from there). Aisha sent a message to Marwan ibn al-Hakam who was the governor of Medina, and said to him: Fear Allah, and return the woman to her home. Marwan said (according to Sulayman's version): 'Abd al-Rahman forced me. Marwan said (according to the version of al-Qasim): Did not the case of Fatimah daughter of Qays reach you? Aisha replied: There would be no harm to you if you did not make mention of the tradition of Fatimah. Marwan said: If you think that it was due to some evil (i.e. reason), then it is sufficient for you to see that there is also an evil between the two.
2296 | Maimun bin Mihram said “I came to Median and went to Sa’id bin Al Musayyab”. I said (to him) Fathimah daughter of Qais was divorced and she shifted from her house. Sa’id said “This woman has perverted people. She was arrogant so she was placed with Ibn Umm Makhtum, the blind.”
2297 | Jabir said “My maternal aunt was divorced by three pronouncements and she went out to cut down fruit from her palm trees. A man met her and forbade her (to go out). So she went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned it to him. He said “Go out, and cut down fruit from your palm trees for perhaps you may give alms (sadaqah) or do an act of kindness.
2298 | The Qur’anic verse “Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows a year’s maintenance and residence was abrogated by the verse containing the laws of succession, as one-fourth or one-eighth share was prescribed for them (i.e., the widows). The waiting period for one year was also repealed as a period of four months ten days was prescribed for them.
2299 | Humaid ibn Nafi' reported the following three traditions on the authority of Zaynab, daughter of Abu Salamah:     Zainab said: I visited Umm Habibah when her father AbuSufyan, died. She asked for some yellow perfume containing saffron (khaluq) or something else. Then she applied it to a girl and touched her cheeks.        She said: I have no need of perfume, but I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to observe mourning for one who has died, more than three nights, except for four months and ten days in the case of a husband.        Zaynab said: I also visited Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, when her brother died. She asked for some perfume and used it upon herself.        She then said: I have no need of perfume, but I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say when he was on the pulpit: It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to observe mourning for one who has died, more than three nights, except for four months and ten days in the case of a husband.        Zaynab said: I heard my mother, Umm Salamah, say: A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, the husband of my daughter has died, and she is suffering from sore eyes; may we put antimony in her eyes?        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No. He said this twice or thrice. Each time he said: No. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The waiting period is now four months and ten days. In pre-Islamic days one of you used to throw away a piece of dung at the end of a year.        Humayd said: I asked Zaynab: What do you mean by throwing away a piece of dung at the end of a year.        Zaynab replied: When the husband of a woman died, she entered a small cell and put on shabby clothes, not touching perfume or any other thing until a year passed. Then an animal such as donkey or sheep or bird was provided for her. She rubbed herself with it. The animal with which she rubbed herself rarely survived. She then came out and was given a piece of dung which she threw away. She then used perfume or something else which she desired.    Abu Dawud said: The Arabic word "hafsh" means a small cell.
2300 | Zaynab, daughter of Ka'b ibn Ujrah narrated that Furay'ah daughter of Malik ibn Sinan, told her that she came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him whether she could return to her people, Banu Khidrah, for her husband went out seeking his slaves who ran away. When they met him at al-Qudum, they murdered him.        So I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ):"Should I return to my people, for he did not leave any dwelling house of his own and maintenance for me?        She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied: Yes.  She said: I came out, and when I was in the apartment or in the mosque, he called for me, or he commanded (someone to call me) and, therefore, I was called.        He said: what did you say? So I repeated my story which I had already mentioned about my husband. Thereupon he said: Stay in your house till the term lapses. She said:        So I passed my waiting period in it (her house) for four months and ten days. When Uthman ibn Affan became caliph, he sent for me and asked me about that; so I informed him, and he followed it and decided cases accordingly.
2301 | Ibn ‘Abbas said “The following verse abrogated the rule of passing her waiting period with her people. A  year’s maintenance and residence. She may pass her waiting period now anywhere she wishes. ‘Ata said “If she wishes she can pass her waiting period with the people of her husband and live in the house left by her husband by will. Or she may shift if she wishes according to the pronouncement of Allah the Exalted. But if they leave (the residence) there is no blame on you for what they do. Ata’ said “Then the verses regarding inheritance were revealed. The commandment for living in a house (for one year) was repealed. She may pass her waiting period wherever she wishes.
2302 | ‘Umm Athiyah reported the Prophet(ﷺ) as saying “A woman must not observe mourning for more than three (days) except for four months and ten days in the case of a husband  and she must not wear a dyed garment except one of the types made of dyed yarn or apply collyrium or touch perfume except for a little costus or azfar when she has been purified after her menstrual courses.   The narrator Ya’qub mentioned the words “except washed clothes” instead of the words “one of the types made of dyed yarn”. Ya’qub also added “She must not apply Henna”
2303 | The tradition mentioned above has also been narrated by Al ‘Umm Athiyah from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators. The tradition narrated by Yazid bin Harun from Hisham does perfectly correspond to the tradition transmitted by Ibrahim bin Tahman and ‘Abd Allah Al Shami from Hisham. The narrator Al Misma’I reported Yazid as saying “I do not know but that he said “she should not dye herself.” To this the narrator Harun added “She should not wear colored clothes except one of the types made of dyed yarn.”
2304 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A woman whose husband has died must not wear clothes dyed with safflower (usfur) or with red ochre (mishq) and ornaments. She must not apply henna and collyrium.

I replied: It is only the juice of aloes and contains no perfume.  He said: It gives the face a glow, so apply it only at night and remove it in daytime, and do not comb yourself with scent or henna, for it is a dye.  I asked: What should I use when I comb myself, Messenger of Allah?  He said: Use lote-tree leaves and smear your head copiously with them.

So, ‘Umar bin Abd allah wrote in reply to ‘Abd Allah bin ‘Utbah informing him what she told him. She told that she was under (i.e., the wife of) Sa’d bin Khawlah who belonged to Banu Amir bin Luwayy. He was one of those who participated in the battle of Badr. He died at the Farwell Pilgrimage while she was pregnant. Soon after his death she gave birth to a child. When she was purified from her bleeding after child birth she adorned herself for seekers in marriage. Then Abu Al Sanabil bin Ba’kah a man from Banu Abd Al Dar entered upon her and said to her “What is the matter seeing you adorned, perhaps you are seeking marriage? I swear by Allah you cannot marry until four months and ten days pass away. Saubai’ah said “When she said this to me, I gathered my clothes on me when the evening came and I came to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and asked him about that. He told me that I became lawful when I had delivered a child. He suggested me to marry if I wished.

2310 | ‘Abd Allaah (bin Masud) said “I asked Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) which sin is the gravest?” He replied “That you associate someone with Allaah, while He has created you”.

2311 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      Musaykah, a slave-girl of some Ansari, came and said: My master forces me to commit fornication. Thereupon the following verse was revealed: "But force not your maids to prostitution (when they desire chastity)."

A man betrayed himself and had intercourse with his wife after he had offered the night prayer, and he did not break his fast. So Allah, the Exalted, intended to make it (fasting) easy for those who survived,  thus providing a concession and utility. Allah, the Glorified, said: "Allah knoweth what ye used to do secretly among yourselves." By this Allah benefited the people and provided concession and ease to them.
2314 | Al Bara’ (bin Azib) said “When a man fasted and slept, he could not eat till (another nigh) like it.” Sarmah bin Qais Al Ansari came to his wife while he was fasting and asked her Do you have something (to eat)? She replied “No”. Let me go and seek something for you. So, she went out and sleep overcame him. She came (back) and said (to him) .You are deprived (of food). He fainted before noon. He used to work all day long at his land. This was mentioned to the Prophet (ﷺ). So the following verse was revealed. “Permitted to you on the nights of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. Allah knoweth what yes used to do secretly amongst yourselves. But he turned to you and forgave you. So now associate with them and seek what Allaah hath ordained for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears to you. He recited up to the words “of dawn”.
2315 | Salamah bin Al Akwa said “After the revelation of the verse “For those who can do it(with hardship) is a ransom, the feeding of one, that is indigent, is one of us intended to leave fast and pay ransom, he could do so.” until the verse following it was revealed and abrogated the (previous) verse.”
2316 | Ibn ‘Abbas explain the Qur’anic verse “For those who can do it(with hardship) is a ransom, the feeding of one, that is indigent” said “If one of them wished to pay ransom by providing food to an indigent person he could pay ransom.. Thus, his fast was complete. Allaah, the Exalted pronounced “But he that will give more of his own free will, it is better for him”. Again he pronounced “So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that month should spend it in fasting.” But, if anyone is ill or on a journey the prescribed period (should be made up) by days later.
2317 | Ibn ‘Abbas said “The verse concerning the payment of ransom stands valid for pregnant and sucking woman.”
2318 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Explaining the verse; "For those who can do it (with hard-ship) is a ransom, the feeding of one, that is indigent," he said: This was a concession granted to the aged man and woman who were able to keep fast; they were allowed to leave the fast and instead feed an indigent person for each fast; (and a concession) to pregnant and suckling woman when they apprehended harm (to themselves).
2319 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The month consists of twenty-nine days, but do not fast till you sight it (the moon) and do not break your fast till you sight it.

If it was sighted, then well and good; in case it was not sighted, and there was no cloud and dust before him (on the horizon), he would not keep fast the next day. If there appeared (on the horizon) before him cloud or dust, he would fast the following day. Ibn Umar would end his fasting alone with the people, and did not follow this calculation.

The man said: Messenger of Allah, you are not like us ; Allah has forgiven you your past and future sins.

He said: No. He said: Sit down. Then a huge basket containing dates ('araq) was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ). He then said to him: Give it as sadaqah (i.e. alms). He said: Messenger of Allah, there is no poorer family than mine between the two lave plains of it (Medina).

Malik have narrated this tradition like the one narrated by Ibn 'Uyainah. Al-Awza'i narrated in his version the words: Beg pardon of Allah.

He said: Take this and give it as sadaqah (alms). He said: Messenger of Allah, there is no poorer than I.

While he was waiting, a man came forward driving his donkey loaded with food. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Where is the man who was burnt just now ? Thereupon the man stood up. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Give it as sadaqah (alms). He asked: Messenger of Allah, to others than us ? By Allah. we are hungry, we have nothing (to eat). He said: Eat it yourselves.

2401 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:If a man falls ill during Ramadan and he dies, while he could not keep the fast, food will be provided (for the poor men) on his behalf ; there is no atonement (for his fasts) due from him.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fasted and we fasted until he reached a certain stage. He said: You have come near your enemy; the breaking of fast will bring you more strength. Then morning came when some of us fasted and other broke their fast. He (Abu Sa'id al-Khudri) said: We then proceeded and alighted at a stage. He said: You are going to attack your enemy tomorrow morning ; breaking the fast will bring you more strength ; so break your fast (i.e. do not keep fast).

When he came back to his village, he said: I swear by Allah, today I witnessed a thing of which I could not even think to see.

When Umar observed this (his anger), he said: We are satisfied with Allah as Lord, with Islam as religion, and with Muhammad as Prophet. We seek refuge in Allah from the anger of Allah, and from the anger of His Apostle. Umar continued to repeat these words till his anger cooled down. He then asked: Messenger of Allah, what is the position of one who observes a perpetual fast?        He replied: May he not fast or break his fast.  Musaddad said in his version: He has neither fasted nor broken his fast. The narrator, Ghaylan, doubted the actual wordings.        He asked: What is the position of one who fasts two days and does not fast one day?        He said: Is anyone able to do that?  He asked: What is the position of one who fasts every second day (i.e. fasts one day and does not fasts the next day)?        He (the Prophet) said: This is the fast that David observed.        He asked: Messenger of Allah, what is the position of one who fasts one day and breaks it for two days?  He replied: I wish I were given the power to observe that. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The observance of three days' fast every month and of one Ramadan to the other (i.e. the fast of Ramadan every year) is (equivalent to) a perpetual fast. I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of Arafah may atone for the sins of the preceding and the coming year, and I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of Ashura' may atone for the sins of the preceding year.

Yes, Messenger of Allah, I have said this. He said: Get up and pray at night and sleep ; fast and break your fast ; fast three days every month: that is equivalent to keeping perpetual fast. I said: Messenger of Allah, I have more power than that. He said: Then fast one day and break your fast one day. That is the most moderate fast ; that is the fast of Dawud (David).

He replied: I am al-Bahili who came to you last year.  He said: What has changed you? You were looking well, then you were good in appearance?  He said: I have only food at night since I departed from you.        Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Why did you torment yourself? Fast during Ramadan (the month of patience) and fast for one day every month.  He said: Increase it for me, for I have (more) strength.  He said: Fast two days.  He again said: Increase it for me.

2507 | Zaid bin Thabit said “I was beside the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) when the divinely-inspired calmness overtook him and the thigh of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) fell on my thigh. I did not find any weightier than the thigh of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). He then regained his composure and said “Write down. I wrote on a shoulder. Not equal are thise believers who sit (at home), other than those who have a (disabling) hurt, and those who strive in the way of Allaah. When Ibn Umm Makhtum who was blind heard the excellence of the warriors. He stood up and said “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) how is it for those believers who are unable to fight (in the path of Allaah)? When he finished his question his divinely-inspired calmness overtook him, and his thigh fell on my thigh and I found its weight the second time as I found the first time.” When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) regained his composure, he said “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Other than those who have a (disabling hurt).

Everything with which a man amuses himself is vain except three (things): a man's training of his horse, his playing with his wife, and his shooting with his bow and arrow. If anyone abandons archery after becoming an adept through distaste for it, it is a blessing he has abandoned; or he said: for which he has been ungrateful.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What about his prayers since the time the other died, and his fasting since the time the other died--the narrator Shu'bah doubted the words, "his fasting--and his deeds since the time the other died. The distance between them is just like the distance between heaven and earth.
2525 | Narrated AbuAyyub al-Ansari:      AbuAyyub heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Capitals will be conquered at your hands, and you will have to raise companies in large armies.

When the time of departure arrived, he came to me and said: I do not know what would be the portions, and how much would be my portion. So offer something (as wages) to me, whether there would be any portion or not. I offered three dinars (as his wages) for him. When some booty arrived, I wanted to offer him his portion.

He then placed his hand on my head and said: Ibn Hawalah, when you see the caliphate has settled in the holy land, earthquakes, sorrows and serious matters will have drawn near and on that day the Last Hour will be nearer to mankind than this hand of mine is to your head.

Summon them to Islam and if they agree, accept it from them and refrain from them. Then summon them to leave their territory and transfer to the abode of the Emigrants and tell them that if they do so, they will have the same rights and responsibilities as the Emigrants, but if they refuse and choose their own abode, tell them that they will be like the desert Arabs who are Muslims subject to Allaah’s jurisdiction which applies to the believers, but will have no spoil or booty unless they strive with the Muslims. If they refuse demand jizyah (poll tax) from them, if they agree accept it from them and refrain from them. But if they refuse, seek Alaah’s help and fight with them. When you invade the fortress and they (its people) offer to capitulate and have the matter referred to Allaah’s jurisdiction, do not grant this, for you do not know whether or not you will hit on Allaah’s jurisdiction regarding them.

When Abu Ayyub al-Ansari was informed about it, he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibiting to kill in confinement.

You look on the temporal goods of this world, but Allaah looketh to the Hereafter”. And Allaah is exalted in might and Wise. Had it not been for a previous ordainment from Allaah, a severe penalty would have reached you for the (ransom) that you took. Allaah then made the spoils of war lawful.    Abu Dawud said “I heard that Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked about the name of Abu Nuh”. He said “What will you do with his name? His name is a bad one.    Abu Dawud said “the name of Abu Nuh is Qurad.

When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw it, he felt great tenderness about it and said: If you consider that you should free her prisoner for her and return to her what belongs to her, (it will be well). They said: Yes. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made an agreement with him that he should let Zaynab come to him, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent Zayd ibn Harithah and a man of the Ansar (the Helpers) and said: Wait in the valley of Yajij till Zaynab passes you, then you should accompany her and bring her back.
2693 | Marwan and Al Miswar bin Makhramah told that when the deputation of the Hawazin came to the Muslims and asked the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) to return to them their property, the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said to them “with me are those whom you see”. The speech dearest to me is the one which is true, so choose (one of the two) either the captives or the property. They said “We choose our captives. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) stood up, extolled Allaah and then said “To proceed, your brethren have come repentant I have considered that I should return their captives to them, so let those of you who are willing to release the captives act accordingly, but those who wish to hold on to what they have till we give them some of the first booty Allaah gives us may do so. The people said “We are willing for that (to release their captives), Apostle of Allaah. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “We cannot distinguish between those of you who have granted that and those who have not , so return till your headmen may tell us about your affair.

A man got up with a ball of hair in his hand and said: I took this to repair the cloth under a pack-saddle. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You can have what belongs to me and to the Banu al-Muttalib. He said: If it produces the result that I now realise, I have no desire for it.
2695 | Abu Talhah said “When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) prevailed on any people, he stayed three nights in the field. Ibn Al Muthanna said “When he prevailed over people, he liked to stay three nights in the field.”    Abu Dawud said “Yahya bin Sa’id used to object to this tradition for this is not from his early traditions because his memory was spoiled at the age of forty five.

I came back to Madeenah. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) met me and said to me “Give me the woman, Salamah. I said to him, I swear by Allaah, she is to my liking and I have not yet untied he garment. He kept silence, and when the next day came the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) met me in the market and said to me “Give me the woman, Salamah, by Allaah, your father.

2717 | Abu Qatadah said “We went out with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) in the year of Hunain. And when the armies met, the Muslims suffered a reverse. I saw one of the polytheists prevailing over a Muslim, so I went round him till I came to him from behind and struck him with my sword at the vein between his neck and shoulder. He came towards me and closed with me, so that I felt death was near, but he was overtaken by death and let me go. I then caught upon on “Umar bin Al Khattab and said to him “What is the matter with the people?” He said “It is what Allaah has commanded. Then the people returned and the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)sat down and said “If anyone kills a man and can prove it, he will get his spoil. I stood up and said “Who will testify for me? I then sat down.” He said again “If anyone kills a man and can prove it, he will get his spoil. I stood up and said “Who will testify for me? I then sat down.” He then said the same for the third time. I then stood up. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “What is the matter with you, Abu Qatadah? I told him the story. A man from the people said “He has spoken the truth, and I have this spoil with me, so make him agreeable (to take something in exchange). Abu Bakr said “In that case I swear by Allaah that he must not do so. One of the Allaah’s heroes does not fight for Allaah and his Apostle and then give you his spoil. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “He has spoken the truth, hand it over to him. Abu Qatadah said “he handed it over to me, I sold the coat of mail and brought a garden among Banu Salamh. This was the first property I acquired in the Islamic period.
2718 | Anas reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “He who kills and infidel gets his spoil.” Abu Talhah killed twenty men that day meaning the day of Hunain and got their spoils.

The weapon used by the Non – Arabs in those days was dagger.”
2719 | ‘Awf bin malik Al Ashja’I said “I went out with Zaid bin Harith in the battle of Mutah. For the reinforcement of the Muslim army a man from the people of Yemen accompanied me.

We went on and met the Byzantine armies. There was a man among them on a reddish horse with a golden saddle and golden weapons. This Byzantinian soldiers began to attack the Muslims desperately.

Khalid bin Al Walid sent for him and took his spoils. ‘Awf said “I came to him and said “Khalid, do you know that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) had decided to give spoils to the killer? He said “Yes, I thought it abundant. I said “You should return it to him, or I shall tell you about it before the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). But he refused to return it. ‘Awf said “We then assembled with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). I told him the story of the man of reinforcement and what Khalid had done. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Khalid, what made you do the work you have done?” He said “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I considered it to be abundant. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Khalid, return it to him what you have taken from him.” ‘Awf said “I said to him “here you are, Khalid. Did I not keep my word? The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “What is that? I then informed him.” He said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) became angry and said “Khalid, do not return it to him. Are you going to leave my commanders? You may take from them what is best for you and eave to them what is worst.
2720 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by ‘Awf bin Malik Al Ashja’I through a different chain of narrators.
2721 | Narrated Awf ibn Malik al-Ashja'i ; Khalid ibn al-Walid:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgement that the killer should have what was taken from the man he killed, and did not make this subject to division into fifths.

Aban said: Give us a share (from the booty), Messenger of Allah. AbuHurayrah said: I said: Do not give them a share, Messenger of Allah. Aban said: Why are you talking so, Wabr. You have come to us from the peak of Dal. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Sit down, Aban. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not give any share to them (from the booty).
2724 | Abu Hurairah said “I came to Madeenah when the Abu Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was in Khaibar, after it was captured. I asked him to give me a share from the booty. A son of Sa’id bin Al ‘As spoke and said “Do not give him any share, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). I said “This is the killer of Ibn Qauqal.” (The son of) Sa’id bin Al ‘As said “Oh, how wonderful! A Wabr who came down to us from the peak of Dal blames me of having killed a Muslim whom Allaah honored at my hands and did not disgrace me at his hands.   Abu Dawud said “They were about ten persons. Six of them were killed and the remaining returned.
2725 | Abu Nusa said “We arrived just at the moment when the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) conquered Khaibar and he allotted us a portion (or he said he gave us some of it). He allotted nothing to anyone who was not present at the conquest of Khaybar, giving shares only to those who were present with him except for those who were in our ship, Ja’far and his companions to whom he gave (a portion) something along with them.
2726 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up, i.e. on the day of Badr, and said: Uthman has gone off on the business of Allah and His Apostle, and I shall take the oath of allegiance on his behalf.

2727 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Yazid ibn Hurmuz said: Najdah wrote to Ibn Abbas asking him about such-and-such, and such-and-such, and he mentioned some things; he (asked) about a slave whether he would get something from the spoils; and he (asked) about women whether they used to go out (on expeditions) along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and whether they would be allotted a share, Ibn Abbas said: Had I not apprehended a folly, I would not have written (a reply) to him. As for the slave, he was given a little of the spoils (as a reward from the booty); as to the women, they would treat the wounded and supply water.
2728 | Yazid bin Humruz said “Najdah Al Hururi wrote to Ibn ‘Abbas asking him whether the women participated in battle along with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and whether they were allotted a share from the spoils. I (Yazid bin Hurmuz) wrote a letter on behalf of Ibn ‘Abbas to Najdah. They participated in the battle along with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), but no portion (from the spoils) was allotted to them, they were given only a little of it.
2729 | Narrated Umm Ziyad:      Hashraj ibn Ziyad reported on the authority of his grandmother that she went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for the battle of Khaybar. They were six in number including herself.        (She said): When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was informed about it, he sent for us. We came to him, and found him angry.        He said: With whom did you come out, and by whose permission did you come out?        We said: Messenger of Allah, we have come out to spin the hair, by which we provide aid in the cause of Allah. We have medicine for the wounded, we hand arrows (to the fighters), and supply drink made of wheat or barley.        He said: Stand up. When Allah bestowed victory of Khaybar on him, he allotted shares to us from spoils that he allotted to the men.  He (Hashraj ibn Ziyad) said: I said to her: Grandmother, what was that?  She replied: Dates.
2730 | Narrated Umayr, client of AbulLahm:      I was present at Khaybar along with my masters who spoke about me to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He ordered about me, and a sword was girded on me and I was trailing it. He was then informed that I was a slave. He, therefore, ordered that I should be given some inferior goods.    Abu Dawud said: This means that he (the Prophet) did not allot a portion of the spoils.   Abu Dawud said: Abu 'Ubaid said: As he (the narrator Abi al-Lahm) made eating meat unlawful on himself, he was called Abi al-Lahm (one who hates meat).
2731 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      I supplied water to my companions on the day of Badr.
2732 | A’ishah said (this is the version of narrator Yahya). A man from the polytheists accompanied the Prophet (ﷺ) to fight along with him. He said “Go back. Both the narrators (Musaddad and Yahya) then agreed. The Prophet said “We do not want any help from a polytheist.”
2733 | Ibn ‘Umar said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) allotted three portions for a man and his horse, one for him and two for his horse.
2734 | Narrated AbuUmrah (al-Ansari?):      We four persons, came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and we (i.e. each one of us) had horses. He therefore, allotted one portion for each of us, and two portions for his horse.
2735 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Abu ‘Umrah through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. But this version has “Three Persons” and added “To the horseman three portions.”
2736 | Narrated Mujammi' ibn Jariyah al-Ansari:      Mujammi' was one of the Qur'an-reciters (qaris), and he said: We were present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaybiyyah. When we returned, the people were driving their camels quickly.        The people said to one another: What is the matter with them?        They said: Revelation has come down to the Prophet (ﷺ). We also proceeded with the people, galloping (our camels). We found the Prophet (ﷺ) standing on his riding-animal at Kura' al-Ghamim.        When the people gathered near him, he recited: "Verily We have granted thee a manifest victory.        A man asked: Is this a victory, Messenger of Allah?  He replied: Yes. By Him in Whose hands the soul of Muhammad is, this is a victory. Khaybar was divided among those who had been at al-Hudaybiyyah, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) divided it into eighteen portions. The army consisted of one thousand five hundred men, of which three hundred were cavalry, and he gave two shares to a horseman and one to a foot-soldier.    Abu Dawud said: Abu Mu'awiyah's tradition is sounder, and it is one which is followed. I think the error is in the tradition of Mujammi', because he said: "three hundred horsemen." when there were only two hundred.
2737 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said on the day of Badr: He who does such-and-such, will have such-and such. The young men came forward and the old men remained standing near the banners, and they did not move from there. When Allah bestowed victory on them, the old men said: We were support for you. If you had been defeated, you would have returned to us. Do not take this booty alone and we remain (deprived of it). The young men refused (to give), and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has given it to us. Then Allah sent down: "They ask thee concerning (things taken as) spoils of war, Say: (Such) spoils are at the disposal of Allah and the Apostle......Just as they Lord ordered thee out of thy house in truth, even though a party among the believers disliked it." This proved good for them. Similarly obey me. I know the consequence of this better than you.
2738 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said on the day of Badr: He who kills a man will get such-and-such, and he who captivates a man will get such-and-such. The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition in a similar manner. The tradition of Khalid is more perfect.
2739 | The tradition mentioned above has been transmitted by Dawud with a different chain of narrators. He said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) apportioned it (spoils of war) equally. The tradition of Khalid is more perfect.

They are like one hand over against all those who are outside the community. Those who have quick mounts should return to those who have slow mounts, and those who got out along with a detachment (should return) to those who are stationed. A believer shall not be killed for an unbeliever, nor a confederate within the term of confederation with him.   Ibn Ishaq did not mention retaliation and equality in respect of blood.

Abu Basir said: Let me look at it. He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled and came to Medina, and running entered the mosque. The Prophet ( may peace be upon him) said: This man has seen something frightful. He said: I swear by Allah that my Companion has been killed, and im as good as dead.

He said: If anyone prays like our prayer, and sacrifices like our sacrifice, his sacrifice is all right. If anyone sacrifices before the prayer (for 'Id), that is goat meant for flesh. Abu Burdah b. Niyar stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, I swear by Allah, I sacrificed before I went for prayer. I thought it was the day of eating and drinking; so I made haste, and ate myself, and supplied flesh to my family and neighbors. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: That is a goat meant for eating flesh. He said: I have a kid (of less than a year) which is better than two goats meant for flesh. Will it be valid from me ? He said: Yes, but it will not be valid for anyone after you.
2801 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      A maternal uncle of mine called AbuBurdah sacrificed before the prayer (for 'Id). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Your goat is meant for flesh. He said: Messenger of Allah, I have a domestic kid with me. He said: Sacrifice it, but it is not valid for any man other than you.
2802 | Narrated Ubayd ibn Firuz:      I asked al-Bara' ibn Azib: What should be avoided in sacrificial animals? He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  stood among us, and my fingers are smaller than his fingers, and my fingertips are smaller than his fingertips. He said (pointing with his fingers): Four (types of animals) should be avoided in sacrifice: A One-eyed animal which has obviously lost the sight of one eye, a sick animal which is obviously sick, a lame animal which obviously limps and an animal with a broken leg with no marrow. I also detest an animal which has defective teeth. He said: Leave what you detest, but do not make it illegal for anyone.   Abu Dawud said: (By a lean animal mean) and animal which has no marrow.
2803 | Narrated Yazid Dhu Misr :      I came to Utbah ibn AbdusSulami and said: AbulWalid, I went out seeking sacrificial animals. I did not find anything which attracted me except an animal whose teeth have fallen. So I abominated it. What do you say (about it)? He said: Why did you not bring it to me? He said: Glory be to Allah: Is if lawful for you and not lawful for me? He said: Yes, you doubt and I do not doubt. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has forbidden an animal whose ear has been uprooted so much so that its hole appears (outwardly), and an animal whose horn has broken from the root, and an animal which has totally lost the sight of its eye, and an animal which is so thin and weak that it cannot go with the herd, and an animal with a broken leg.
2804 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) enjoined upon us to pay great attention to the eye and both ears, and not to sacrifice a one-eyed animal, and an animal with a slit which leaves something hanging at the front or back of the ear, or with a lengthwise slit with a perforation in the ear. I asked AbuIshaq: Did he mention an animal with broken horns and uprooted ears? He said: No. I said: 'What is the Muqabalah ?' He replied: 'It has been cut from the back of its ear.' I said: 'What about the Sharqa'? He replied: 'The ear has been split.' I said: 'What about the Kharqa'? He replied: 'A hole is made (in its ears) as a distinguishing mark.'"
2805 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) prohibited to sacrifice an animal with a slit ear and broken horn.    Abu Dawud said: The narrator Jurayy (b. Kulaib) is Sadusi, and belongs to Basrah. No one narrated traditions from him except Qatadah.
2806 | Narrated Qatadah:I asked Sa'id b. al-Musayyab: What is meant by animal with a slit ear and broken horn ? He replied: Half and more than half.
2807 | Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdullah :We performed tamattu' during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), sacrificed a cow for seven and a camel for seven people. We shared them.

This is from me and from those who did not sacrifice from my community.

2812 | Narrated 'Aishah:Some people of desert came at the time of sacrifice in the time of Apostle of  Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Store up for three days and give the rest as sadaqah (alms). After than the people said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Messenger of Allah, the people used to benefit from their sacrifices, take and dissolve fat from them, and make water-bags (from their skins). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What is that ? or whatever he said: They said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), you have prohibited to preserve the meat of sacrifice after three days. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I prohibited you due to a body of people who came to you. Now eat, give it as sadaqah (alms), and store up.
2813 | Narrated Nubayshah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: We forbade you to eat their meat for more than three days in order that you  might have abundance; now Allah has produced abundance, so you may eat, store up and seek reward.

And when you slaughter, you should use a good method, for one of you should sharpen his knife, and give the animal as little pain as possible.
2816 | Narrated Hisham b. Zaid:I entered upon al-Hakam b. Ayyub along with Anas. He saw some youths or boys who had set up a hen and shooting at it. Anas said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade to kill an animal in confinement.
2817 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:The verse: "So eat of (meats) on which Allah's name hath been pronounced" and the verse: "Eat not of  (meats) on which Allah's name hath not been pronounced" were abrogated, meaning an exception was made therein by the verse: "The food of the people of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them."
2818 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      explaining the verse "But the evil ones ever inspire their friend to contend with you" They used to say: Do not eat which Allah killed, but eat which you slaughtered. So Allah revealed the verse: "Eat not of (meats) on which Allah's name hath not been pronounced"...to the end of the verse.
2819 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Jews came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: We eat which we kill but we do not eat which Allah kills? So Allah revealed: "Eat not of (meats) on which Allah's name hath not been pronounced." to the end of the verse.
2820 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade to eat (the meat of animals) slaughtered by the bedouins for vainglory and pride.   Abu Dawud said: The narrator Ghundar narrated this tradition as a saying of Ibn 'Abbas (and not of the Prophet).
2821 | Narrated Rafi' b. Khadij:I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, we shall meet the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives with us. May we kill with a sharp-edged white stone (flint) and with splinter of a staff ? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Hasten in slaughtering it. When Allah's name is mentioned you may eat what is killed by anything which causes the blood to flow except tooth and claw. I shall tell you about it. The tooth is a bone, and the claw is the knife of Abyssinians. Some people hastened and went forward, they made haste and got booty, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in the rear and they setup cooking pots. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed by over the cooking pots. He ordered to turn them over. He then divided (the spoils of war) between them, and gave them a camel for ten goats in equation. One of the camels of the people ran away, and they had no horses with them at that time. A man shot an arrow at it, and Allah prevented it from escaping. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Among animals (i.e. camels) there are some which bolt like wild animals ; so when any of them does so, do with it like this.

He then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and informed him about that, and he ordered him to eat it.
2824 | Narrated Adi ibn Hatim:      I said: Messenger of Allah, tell me when one of us catches game and has no knife; may he slaughter with a flint and a splinter of stick. He said: Cause the blood to flow with whatever you like and mention Allah's name.
2825 | Narrated AbulUshara':      AbulUshara' reported on the authority of his father: He asked: Messenger of Allah, is the slaughtering to be done only in the upper part of the breast and the throat? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied: If you pierced its thigh, it would serve you.    Abu Dawud said: This is the way suitable for slaughtering an animal which has fallen into a well or runs loose.
2826 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Ibn Isa added: (Ibn Abbas) and AbuHurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade the devil's sacrifice. AbuIsa added in his version: This refers to the slaughtered animal whose skin cut off, and is then left to die without its jugular veins being severed.
2827 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the embryo. He replied: Eat it if you wish.        Musaddad's version says: we said: Messenger of Allah, we slaughter a she-camel, a cow and a sheep, and we find an embryo in its womb. Shall we throw it away or eat it? He replied: Eat it if you wish for the slaughter of its mother serves its slaughter.

They (the people) said: Messenger of Allah, there are people here, recent converts from polytheism, who bring us meat and we do not know whether or not they mentioned Allah's name over it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Mention Allah's name and eat.
2830 | Narrated Nubayshah:      A man called the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): We used to sacrifice Atirah in pre-Islamic days during Rajab; so what do you command us? He said: Sacrifice for the sake of Allah in any month whatever; obey Allah, Most High, and feed(the people). He said: We used to sacrifice a Fara' in pre-Islamic days, so what do you command us? He said: On every pasturing animal there is a Fara' which is fed by your cattle till it becomes strong and capable of carrying load.        The narrator Nasr said (in his version): When it becomes capable of carrying load of the pilgrims, you may slaughter it and give its meat as charity (sadaqah).       The narrator Khalid's version says: You (may give it) to the travellers, for it is better. Khalid said: I asked AbuQilabah: How many pasturing animals? He replied: One hundred.

2834 | Narrated Umm Kurz al-Ka'biyyah:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Two resembling sheep are to be sacrificed for a boy and one for a girl.        AbuDawud said: I heard Ahmad (ibn Hanbal) say: The Arabic word mukafi'atani means equal (in age) or resembling each other.
2835 | Narrated Umm Kurz:      I heard the Prophet (nay peace be upon him) say: Let the birds stay in their roosts. She said: I also heard him say: Two sheep are to be sacrificed for a boy and one for a girl, but it does you no harm whether they are male or female.
2836 | Narrated Umm Kurz:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Two sheep which resemble each other are to be sacrificed for a boy and one for a girl.   Abu Dawud said: This is a sound tradition, and the tradition narrated by Sufyan is misunderstanding.
2837 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A boy is in pledge for his Aqiqah. Sacrifice is made for him on the seventh day, his head is shaved and is smeared with blood.        When Qatadah was asked about smearing with blood, how that should be done, he said: When you cut the head (i.e. throat) of the animal (meant for Aqiqah), you may take a few hair of it, place them on its veins, and then place them in the middle of the head of the infant, so that the blood flows on the hair (of the infant) like a threat. Then its head may be washed and shaved off.    Abu Dawud said: In narrating the word "is smeared with blood" (yudamma) there is a misunderstanding on the part of Hammam.   Abu Dawud said: Hammam has been opposed in narrating the words "is smeared with blood". This is misunderstanding of Hammam. They narrated he word "he is given a name (yusamma) and Hammam narrated it "is smeared with blood" (yudamma).   Abu Dawud said: This tradition is not followed.
2838 | Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A boy is in pledge for his Aqiqah, Sacrifice is made for him on the seventh day, his head is shaved and he is given name.   Abu Dawud said: The word wa yusamma is sounder as narrated by Salam b. Abi Muti' from Qatadah, and narrated by Iyas b. Daghfal and Ash'ath from al-Hassan who narrated wa yusamma (and he is given a name).
2839 | Narrated Salman b. 'Amir al-Dabbi:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Along with a boy there is an 'Aqiqah, so shed blood on his behalf, and remove injury from him.
2840 | Narrated Al-Hasan:To remove the injury is the shaving of the head.
2841 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sacrificed a ram for both al-Hasan and al-Husayn each (Allah be pleased with them).
2842 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked  about the aqiqah. He replied: Allah does not like the breaking of ties (uquq), as though he disliked the name. And he said: If anyone has a child born to him and wishes to offer a sacrifice on its behalf, he may offer two resembling sheep for a boy and one for a girl. And he was asked about fara'. He replied: Fara' is right. If you leave it (i.e. let it grow till it becomes a healthy camel of one year or two years, then you give it to a widow or give it in the path of Allah for using it as a riding beast, it is better than slaughtering it at the age when its meat is stuck to its hair, and you turn over your milking vessel and annoy your she-camel.
2843 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      When a boy was born to one of us in the pre-Islamic period, we sacrificed a sheep and smeared his head with its blood; but when Allah brought Islam, we sacrificed a sheep, shaved his head and smeared his head with saffron.
2844 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: If anyone gets a dog, except a sheeping or hunting or a farm dog, a qirat of his reward will be deducted daily.

2846 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) ordered to kill dogs, and we were even killing a dog which a woman brought with her from the desert. Afterwards he forbade to kill them, saying: Confine yourselves to the type which is black.
2847 | Narrated 'Abi b. Hatim:I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) ,and said: I set off my trained dogs, and they catch (something) for me: may I eat (it)? He said: When you set off trained dogs and mention Allah's name, eat what they catch for you. I said: Even if they killed (the game)? He said: Even if they killed (the game) as long as another dog does not join it. I said: I shoot with a featherless arrow, and it strikes the target, may I eat (it) ? He said: If you shoot with a featherless arrow and mention Allah's name, and it strikes the aim, and pierce it, eat it ; and if it strikes with its middle, do not eat (it).
2848 | Narrated 'Adi b. Hatim:I asked the Messenger of Allah. I said: We hunt with these dogs. He replied: When you set off your dog and mention Allah's name over it, eat what it catches for you, even if it kills it, except that the dog has eaten (any of it); if the dog has eaten (any of it), do not eat, for Im afraid it has caught it only for itself.
2849 | Narrated 'Adi b. Hatim:The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: When you shoot your arrow and mention Allah's name, and you find it (the game) after a day, and you do not find it in water, and you find in it only the mark of you arrow, eat (it).

2850 | Narrated 'Adi b. Hatim:The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: When the animal at which you shot falls in water, is drowned, and dies, do not eat.
2851 | Narrated Adi ibn Hatim:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Eat what ever is caught for you by a dog or a hawk you have trained and set off when you have mentioned Allah's name. I said: (Does this apply) if it killed (the animal)? He said: When it kills it without eating any of it, for it caught it only for you.   Abu Dawud said: If a hawk eats any of it, there is no harm (in eating it). If a dog eats it, it is disapproved (to eat the meat). If it drinks blood, there is no harm (in eating it).
2852 | Narrated AbuTha'labah al-Khushani:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said about the game hunted by a dog: If you set off your dog and have mentioned Allah's name, eat (it),  even if it eats any of it; and eat what your hands return you.
2853 | Narrated Adi ibn Hatim:      Messenger of Allah, one of us shoots at the game, and follows its mark for two or three days, and then finds it dead, and there is his arrow (pierced) in it, may he eat it? He said: Yes, if he wishes, or he said: he may eat if he wishes.
2854 | Narrated 'Adi b. Hatim:I asked Prophet (ﷺ) about featherless arrow. He said: If it strikes with its end, eat, and if it strikes with the middle part of it, do not eat, for it died by a violent blow. I said: I set off my dog? He replies: If you mention Allah's name, eat, otherwise do not eat. If it eats any of it, do not eat, for it caught for itself. He asked: I set off my dog, and I find with it another dog ? He replied: Do not eat, because you mentioned Allah's name on your dog.
2855 | Narrated Abu Taa'labat b. al-Khushani:I said: Messenger of Allah, I hunt with my trained dog, and with my untrained dog? He said: 'What you hunt with your trained dog, mention Allah's names (on it) and eat; and what you hunt with your untrained dog, and you find in a position that you slaughter it, then eat.
2856 | Narrated AbuTha'labah al-Khushani:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: AbuTha'labah, eat what returns to you by your bow and your dog.        Ibn Harb's version adds: "The trained (dog), and your hand, then eat, whether it has been slaughtered or not slaughtered".
2857 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      There was a bedouin called AbuTha'labah. He said: Messenger of Allah, I have trained dogs, so tell me your opinion about (eating) the animal they hunt. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If you have trained dogs, then eat what they catch for you. He asked: Whether it is slaughtered or not? He replied: Yes. He asked: Does it apply even if it eats any of it? He replied: Even if it eats any of it. He again asked: Messenger of Allah, tell me your opinion about my bow (i.e. the game hunted by arrow). He said: Eat what your bow returns to you, whether it is slaughtered or not. He asked: If it goes out of my sight? He replied: Even if it goes out of your sight, provided it has no stench, or you find a mark on it other than the mark of your arrow.       He asked: Tell me about the use of the vessels of the Magians when we are forced to use them. He replied: Wash them and eat in them.
2858 | Narrated AbuWaqid:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Whatever is cut off of an animal when it is alive is dead.

2860 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He said: He who sticks to a king is perverted. This version adds: The nearer a servant (of Allah) goes to a king, the farther he keeps away from Allah.

2862 | Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: It is the duty of a Muslim man who has something which is to be given as bequest not to have it for two nights without having his will written regarding it.
2863 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not leave dinars, dirhams, camels and goats, nor did he leave will for anything.
2864 | Narrated 'Amir b. Sa'd:On the authority of his father (Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas): When he (Sa'd) fell ill at Mecca (according to the version of Ibn Abi Kkalaf) - then the agreed version has: which brought him near to death - the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went to visit him. He said: Messenger of Allah, I have a large amount of property, and my daughter is my only heir. May I give two-thirds (of my property) as a sadaqah (charity)? He said: No. He asked: Then a half ? He replied: No. He asked: Then one-third ? He replied: (You may will away) a third and third is a lot. To leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor begging from people. You will not spend anything, seeking thereby to please Allah, without being rewarded for it, even the mouthful you give your wife. I said: Messenger of Allah, shall I be left behind form immigration (to Medina)? He said: If you remain behind after me and do good works seeking the pleasure of Allah, your rank will be raised and degree increased. Perhaps you will not remain behind, and some people will benefit from you and others will be harmed by you. He then said: O Allah, complete the immigration of my Companions and do not turn them back. But miserable was Sa'd b. Khawlah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lamented on him as he died at Mecca.
2865 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:A man asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Messenger of Allah, which sadaqah (charity) is the best ? He replied: (The best sadaqah is) that you give something as sadaqah (charity) when you are healthy, greedy, expect survival and fear poverty, and not that you postpone it until your death. and then you say: For so-and-so is such-and-such, and for so-and-so is such-and-such, while it was already for so-and-so.
2866 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A man giving a dirham as sadaqah (charity) during his life is better than giving one hundred dirhams as sadaqah (charity) at the moment of his death.
2867 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A man or a woman acts in obedience to Allah for sixty years, then when they are about to die they cause injury by their will, so they must go to Hell. Then AbuHurayrah recited: "After a legacy which you bequeath or a debt, causing no injury...that will be the mighty success.    Abu Dawud said: Al-Ash'ath b. Jabir is the grandfather of Nasr b. 'Ali.
2868 | Narrated Abu Dharr: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Abu Dharr, I see you weak, and I like for you what I like for myself. Do not be a leader of two (persons), and do not be a guardian of an orphan.   Abu Dawud said: This has been narrated only by the people of Egypt.
2869 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:The Qur'anic verse goes: "(It is prescribed when death approaches any of you), if he leaves any goods, that he may bequest to parents and next to kin." The bequest was made in this way until the verse of inheritance repealed it.

2871 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      When Allah, Most High, revealed the verses: "Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it". And "Those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans", everyone who had an orphan with him went and separated his food from his (orphan's) food, and his drink from his drink, and began to detain the remaining food which he (the orphan) himself ate or spoiled.       This fell heavy on them, and they mentioned this to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So Allah, Most High, revealed the verse: "They ask thee concerning orphans. Say: The best thing to do is what is for their good; if ye mix their affairs with yours, they are your brethren." Then they mixed their food with his food and their drink with his drink.
2872 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather told that a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I am poor, I have nothing (with me), and I have an orphan. He said: Use the property of your orphan without spending it lavishly, hurrying and taking it as your own property.

Abu Dawud said: The name Abu al-Ghaith is Salim client of Ibn Muti'.
2875 | 'Umair, A Companion of the Prophet (ﷺ) said:A man asked him (the Prophet): Messenger of Allah, what are the grave sins? He replied: They are nine. He then mentioned the tradition to the same effect. This version adds: "And disobedience to the Muslim parents, and to violate the sacred House, your qiblah (direction of prayer), in your life and after death.
2876 | Narrated Khabbab:Mus'ab b. 'Umar was killed at the battle of Uhud, and for him only a coarse cloth would be found as shroud.

2877 | Narrated Buraidah:A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: I donated my slave-girl to my mother, but she died and left the slave-girl. He said: Your reward became due, and she came back to you in inheritance. She said: She died while a month's fasting was due from her. Would it be sufficient or be taken as completed if I fast on her behalf ? He said: Yes. She said: She also did not perform Hajj. Would it be sufficient or be taken completed if I perform (Hajj) on her behalf ? He said: Yes.
2878 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar:'Umar got some land in Khaibar, and when to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I have acquired land in Khaibar which I consider to be more valuable than any I have acquired ; so what do you command me to do with it ? He replied: If you wish, you may make the property as inalienable possession, and give its produce as sadaqah (charity). So 'Umar gave it as a sadaqah declaring that the property must not be sold, given away, or inherited : (and gave its produce as sadaqah to be devoted) to poor, relatives, the emancipation of slaves, Allah's path,  travellers. The narrator Bishr added: "and guests". Then the agreed version goes: No sin being committed by the one who administers it if he eats something from it in a reasonable manner, or gives something to a friend, who does not make his own property. The narrator Bishr added: "(provided) he is not storing-up goods (for himself)".
2879 | Narrated Yahya b. Sa'id:'Abd al-Hamid b. Abd 'Allah b. 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar b. al-Khattab copied to me a document about the religious endowment (waqf) made by 'Umar b. al-Khattab : In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is what Allah's servant 'Umar has written about Thamgh. He narrated the tradition like the one transmitted by Nafi'. He added: "provided he is not storing up goods (for himself)". The surplus fruit will be devoted to the beggar and the deprived. He then went on with the tradition, saying: If the man in charge of Thamgh wishes to buy a slave for his work for its fruits (by selling them), he may do so. Mu'iqib penned it and 'Abd Allah b. al-Arqam witnessed it : In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is what Allah's servant 'Umar , Commander of Faithful, directed, in case of some incident happens to him (i.e. he dies), that Thamg, Sirmah b. al-Akwa', the servant who is there, the hundred shares in (the land of) Khaibr, the servant who is there and the hundred sahres which Muhammad (ﷺ) had donated to me in the valley (nearly) will remain in the custody of Hafsah during her life, then the men of opinion from her family will be in charge of these (endowments), that these will neither be sold not purchased, spending (its produce) where they think (necessary on the beggar, deprived and relatives). There is no harm to the one in charge (of this endowment) if he eats himself, or feeds, or buys slaves with it.
2880 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: When a man dies, his action discontinues from him except three things, namely, perpetual sadaqah (charity), or the knowledge by which benefit is acquired, or a pious child who prays for him.
2881 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      A woman said: Messenger of Allah, my mother suddenly died; if it had not happened, she would have given sadaqah (charity) and donated (something). Will it suffice if I give sadaqah on her behalf? The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Yes, give sadaqah on her behalf.
2882 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:A man said: Messenger of Allah, my mother has died ; will it benefit her if I give sadaqah on her behalf ? He said: Yes. He said: I have a garden, and I call you to witness that I have given it as sadaqah on her behalf.
2883 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather told that Al-'As ibn Wa'il left his will that a hundred slaves should be emancipated on his behalf. His son Hisham emancipated fifty slaves and his son Amr intended to emancipate the remaining fifty on his behalf, but he said: I should ask first the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He, therefore, came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, my father left in his will that a hundred slaves should be emancipated on his behalf and Hisham has emancipated fifty on his behalf and fifty remain. Shall I emancipate them on his behalf? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Had he been a Muslim and you had emancipated slaves on his behalf, or given sadaqah on his behalf, or performed the pilgrimage, that would have reached him.
2884 | Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdullah :That his father died and left a debt of thirty wasqs of a Jew on him. Jabir asked him to defer, but he refused. Jabir then spoke to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asking him to mediate to him on his behalf. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to the Jew and spoke to him about taking fruit-dates in lieu of the debt that was on him. But he refused. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked him to defer (the debt) to him, but he refused. He then narrated the rest of the tradition.
2885 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Knowledge has three categories; anything else is extra; a precise verse, or an established sunnah (practice), or a firm obligatory duty.
2886 | Narrated Jabir:I fell ill, and the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr came to me on foot to visit me. As I was unconscious, I could not speak to him. He performed ablution and sprinkled water on me ; so I became conscious. I said: Messenger of Allah, how should I do in my property, as I have sisters? Thereafter the verse about inheritance was revealed: "They ask thee for legal decision. Say: Allah directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs."
2887 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      I fell ill, and I had seven sisters. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to me and blew on my face. So I became conscious. I said: Messenger of Allah, may I not bequeath one-third of my property to my sisters? He replied: Do good. I asked: Half? He replied: Do good. He then went out and left me, and said: I do not think, Jabir, you will die of this disease. Allah has revealed (verses) and described the share of your sisters. He appointed two-thirds for them. Jabir used to say: This verse was revealed about me: "They ask thee for a legal decision. Say: Allah directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs.
2888 | Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib:The last verse revealed about the decease who left no descendants or ascendants: "They ask thee for the legal decision. Say: Allah directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs."
2889 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, they ask thee for a legal decision about a kalalah. What is meant by kalalah? He replied: The verse revealed in summer is sufficient for you.        I asked AbuIshaq: Does it mean a person who dies and leaves neither children nor father? He said: This is so. The people think it is so.
2890 | Narrated Huzail b. Shurahbil al-Awadi:A man came to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari and Salman b. Rabi'ah, and asked about a case where there were a daughter, a son's daughter and full sister. They replied: The daughter gets half and the full gets half. The son's daughter gets nothing. Go to Ibn Mas'ud and you will find that he agrees with me. So the man came to him and informed him about their opinion. He said: I would then be in error and not be one of those who are rightly guided. But I decide concerning the matter as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did: The daughter gets half, and the son's daughter gets a share which complete thirds (i.e. gets a sixth), and what remain to the full sister."
2891 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and came to a woman of the Ansar in al-Aswaf. The woman brought her two daughters, and said: Messenger of Allah, these are the daughters of Thabit ibn Qays who was killed as a martyr when he was with you at the battle of Uhud, their paternal uncle has taken all their property and inheritance, and he has not left anything for them. What do you think, Messenger of Allah? They cannot be married unless they have some property. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah will decide regarding the matter. Then the verse of Surat an-Nisa was revealed: "Allah (thus) directs you as regards your children's (inheritance)." Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Call to me the woman and her husband's brother. He then said to their paternal uncle: Give them two-thirds and their mother an eighth, and what remains is yours.   Abu Dawud said: The narrator Bishr made a mistake. They were the daughters of Sa'd b. al-Rabi' for Thabit b. Qais was killed in the battle of Yamamah.
2892 | Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdullah : The wife of Sa'd b. al-Rabi said: Messenger of Allah, Sa'd died and left two daughters. He then narrated the rest of the tradition in a similar way.   Abu Dawud said: This is the most correct tradition.
2893 | Narrated Al-Aswad b. Yazid:Mu'adh b. Jabal gave shares of inheritance to a sister and a daughter. He gave each of them half. He was at Yemen while the Prophet (ﷺ) was alive.
2894 | Narrated Qabisah ibn Dhuwayb:      A grandmother came to AbuBakr asking him for her share of inheritance. He said: There is nothing prescribed for you in Allah's Book, nor do I know anything for you in the Sunnah of the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) Go home till I question the people. He then questioned the people, and al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said: I had been present with the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) when he gave grandmother a sixth. AbuBakr said: Is there anyone with you? Muhammad ibn Maslamah stood and said the same as al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah had said. So AbuBakr made it apply to her. Another grandmother came to Umar ibn al-Khattab asking him for her share of inheritance. He said: Nothing has been prescribed for you in Allah's Book. The decision made before you was made for a grandmother other than you. I am not going to add in the shares of inheritance; but it is that sixth. If there are two of you, it is shared between you, but whichever of you is the only one left gets it all.
2895 | Narrated Buraydah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) appointed a sixth to a grandmother if no mother is left to inherit before her.
2896 | Narrated Imran ibn Husayn:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: My son has died; what do I receive from his estate? He replied: You receive a sixth.

Qatadah said: They (the Companions) did not know the heirs with whom he was given (a sixth). Qatadah said: The minimum share given to the grandfather was a sixth.
2897 | Al-Hasan reported that Umar asked:Which of your knows what share the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had given to the grandfather from the estate?

I am the heirs of him who has none, paying blood-wit for him and inheriting from him; and a maternal uncle is the heir of him who has none, paying blood-wit for him and inheriting from him.
2900 | Narrated Al-Miqdam al-Kindi:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I am nearer to every believer than himself, so if anyone leaves a debt or a helpless family, I shall be responsible, but if anyone leaves property, it goes to his heirs. I am patron of him who has none, inheriting his property and freeing him from his liabilities. A maternal uncle is patron of him who has none, inheriting his property and freeing him from his liabilities.   Abu Dawud said: da'iah means dependants or helpless family.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by al-Zubaidi from Rashid b. Sa'd from Ibn 'A'idh on the authority of al-Miqdam. It has also been transmitted by Mu'awiyah b. Salih from Rashid who said: I heard al-Miqdam (say).

He said: Go and look for man of Azd for a year. He then came to him after one year and said: Messenger of Allah, I did not find any man of Azd to give it to him. He said: Look for a man of Khuza'ah whom you meet first and give it to him. When he turned away, he said; Call the man to me. When he came to him, he said: Look for the leading man of Khuza'ah and give it to him.
2904 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      A man of Khuza'ah died and his estate was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: Look for his heir or some relative. But they found neither heir nor relative. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Give it to the leading man of Khuza'ah.

He then said: We shall stay at the valley of Banu Kinarah where the Quraish took an oath on unbelief. This refers to al-Muhassab. The reason is that Banu Kinarah made an alliance with the Quraish against Banu Hashim that they would have no marital connections with them, nor will have commercial transactions with them, not will give them any refuge.   Al-Zuhri said: Khalf means valley.

Amr ibn al-'As then came. A freed slave of hers died and left some property. Her brothers disputed with him and brought the case to Umar ibn al-Khattab.        Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Whatever property a son or a father receives as an heir will go to his agnates, whoever they may be. He then wrote a document for him, witnessed by AbdurRahman ibn Awf, Zayd ibn Thabit and one other person. When AbdulMalik became caliph, they presented the case to Hisham ibn Isma'il or Isma'il ibn Hisham (the narrator is doubtful).

The following verse of Surat Al-Anfal abrogated it: "But kindred by blood have prior right against each other."
2922 | Ibn 'Abbas explained the following Qur'anic verse :"To those also, to whom your right hand was pledged, give your portion." When the Emigrants came to Medina. they inherited from the Helpers without any blood-relationship with them for the brotherhood which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) established between them. When the following verse was revealed: "To (benefit) everyone we have appointed shares and heirs to property left by parent and relatives." it abrogated the verse: "To those also, to whom your right hand was pledged, give their due portion."

When he embraced Islam Allah Most High commanded His Prophet (ﷺ) to give him the share.   The narrator 'Abd al-Aziz added: He did not accept Islam until he was urged on Islam by sword.

He sent his son to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said to him: Go to the Prophet (ﷺ) and tell him: My father extends his greetings to you. He asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam, and they embraced Islam. He divided the camels among them. But it occurred to him then that he should withdraw his camels from them. Is he more entitled to them or we? If he says: Yes or no, then tell him: My father is an old man, and he is the chief of the people living at the water. He has requested you to make me chief after him.        He came to him and said: My father has extended his greetings to you.  He replied: On you and you father be peace.  He said: My father asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam. So they embraced Islam, and their belief in Islam is good. Then it occurred to him that he should take his camels back from them. Is he more entitled to them or are they?        He said: If he likes to give them the camels, he may give them; and if he likes to take them back, he is more entitled to them than his people. If they embraced Islam, then for them is their Islam. If they do not embrace Islam, they will be fought against in the cause of Islam.        He said: My father is an old man; he is the chief of the people living at the spring. He has asked you to appoint me chief after him.        He replied: The office of a chief is necessary, for people must have chiefs, but the chiefs will go to Hell.

2948 | Narrated AbuMaryam al-Azdi:      When I entered upon Mu'awiyah, he said: How good your visit is to us, O father of so-and-so. (This is an idiom used by the Arabs on such occasions). I said: I tell you a tradition which I heard (from the Prophet). I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If Allah puts anyone in the position of authority over the affairs of the Muslims, and he secludes himself (from them), not fulfilling their needs, wants, and poverty, Allah will keep Himself away from him, not fulfilling his need, want and poverty. He said: He (Mu'awiyah) appointed a man to fulfil the needs of the people.
2949 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: It is not on my own that I give you or withhold from you: I am just a treasure, putting it where I have been commanded.
2950 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      Malik ibn Aws ibn al-Hadthan said: One day Umar ibn al-Khattab mentioned the spoils of war and said: I am not more entitled to this spoil of war than you; and none of us is more entitled to it than another, except that we occupy our positions fixed by the Book of Allah, Who is Great and Glorious, and the division made by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), people being arranged according to their precedence in accepting Islam, the hardship they have endured their having children and their need.
2951 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Zayd ibn Aslam said: Abdullah ibn Umar entered upon Mu'awiyah. He asked: (Tell me) your need, AbuAbdurRahman. He replied: Give (the spoils) to those who were set free, for I saw the first thing the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did when anything came to him was to give something to those who had been set free.
2952 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) was brought a pouch  containing bead and divided it among free women and slave women. Aisha said: My father used to divide things between free men and slave.
2953 | Narrated 'Awf bin Malik:When the spoils (fai') came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he divided it that day ; he gave two portions to a married man and one to a bachelor. The narrator Ibn al-Musaffa added: We were summoned, and I would be summoned before 'Ammar. So I was summoned and he gave me two portions, for I had a family ; then 'Ammar b. Yasir was summoned after me and given one.
2954 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I am nearer to the believers than themselves, so if anyone leaves property, it goes to his heirs, and if anyone leaves debt and dependants, let the matter come to me and I shall be responsible.
2955 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: If anyone leaves property, it goes to his heirs. And if anyone leaves dependents (without resources), they come to us.
2956 | Narrated Jabir b. 'Abd Allah :The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: I am nearer to every believer than himself, and if anyone leaves, it goes to his heirs.
2957 | Narrated Nafi':That Ibn 'Umar was presented before the Prophet (ﷺ) on the day of Uhud, when he was fourteen years old, but he did not allow him. He was again presented to him on the day of Khandaq (the battle of Trench) when he was fifteen years old, he allowed him.
2958 | Narrated A man:      Sulaym ibn Mutayr reported on the authority of his father that Mutayr went away to perform hajj.        When he reached as-Suwaida', a man suddenly came searching for medicine and ammonium anthorhizum extract, and he said: A man who heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressing the people commanding and prohibiting them, told me that he said: O people, accept presents so long as they remain presents; but when the Quraysh quarrel about the rule, and the presents are given for the religion of one of you, then leave them alone.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Ibn al-Mubarak from Muhammad b. Yasar from Sulaim b. Mutair.
2959 | Narrated Dhul-Zawa'id:      Mutayr said: I heard a man say: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the Farewell Pilgrimage. He was commanding and prohibiting them (the people). He said: O Allah, did I give full information? They said: Yes. He said: When the Quraysh quarrel about the rule among themselves, and the presents become bribery, them leave them. The people were asked: Who was he (who narrated this tradition)? They said: This was Dhul-Zawa'id, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
2960 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. Ka'b b. Malik al-Ansari:An expedition of the Ansar was operating in Persia with their leader. 'Umar used to send expeditions by turns every year, but he neglected them. When the expired, the people of expedition appointed on the frontier came back. He ('Umar) took serious action against them and threatened them, though they were the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). They said: 'Umar you neglected us, and abandoned the practice for which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded to send the detachments by turns.
2961 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      A son of Adi ibn Adi al-Kindi said that Umar ibn AbdulAziz wrote (to his governors): If anyone asks about the places where spoils (fay') should be spent, that should be done in accordance with the decision made by Umar ibn al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him). The believers considered him to be just, according to the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ): Allah has placed truth upon Umar's tongue and heart. He fixed stipends for Muslims, and provided protection for the people of other religions by levying jizyah (poll-tax) on them, deducting no fifth from it, nor taking  it as booty.
2962 | Narrated AbuDharr:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Allah, the Exalted, has placed truth on Umar's tongue and he speaks it.
2963 | Narrated Malik b. Aws b. Al-Hadathan: 'Umar sent for me when the day rose high. I found him sitting on a couch without cover. When I entered upon him, he said: Malik, some people of you tribe gradually came here, and I have ordered to give them something, so distribute it among them. I said: If you assigned this (work) to some other person, (it would be better). He said: Take it. Then Yarfa' came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, will you permit 'Uthman b. 'Affan, 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, al-Zubair b. al-'Awwam, and Sa'd b, Abi Waqqas (to enter) ? He said:  Yes. So he permitted them and they entered. Yarfa' again came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, would you permit al-'Abbas and 'Ali ? He said: Yes. He then permitted them and they entered. Al-'Abbas said: Commander of Faithful, decide between me and this, referring to 'Ali. Some of them said: Yes, Commander of the Faithful, decide between them and give them comfort. Malik b. Aws said: It occurred to me that both of them brought the other people for this. 'Umar said: Show patience (do not make haste). He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then said: Allah has appointed for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) a special portion (in the booty) which he did not do for anyone. Allah, Most High, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His apostles over any He pleases ; and Allah has power over all things". Allah bestowed (the property of) Banu al-Nadir on His Apostle. I swear by Allah, he did not reserve it for himself, nor did he take it over and above you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to his share for his maintenance annually, or used to take his contribution and give his family their annual contribution (from this property), then take what remained and deal with it as he did with Allah's property. He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes.  He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  died, Abu Bakr said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then you and this ('Ali) came to Abu Bakr, demanding a share from the inheritance of your cousin, and this ('Ali) demanding the share of his wife from (the property of her) father. Abu Bakr then said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah. Allah knows that he (Abu Bakr) was true, faithful, rightly-guided, and the follower of Triuth. Abu Bakr then administered it (property of the Prophet). When Abu Bakr died, I said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr. So I administered whatever Allah wished. Then you and this ('Ali) came. Both of you are at one, and your matter is the same. So they asked me for it (property), and I said: If you wish I give it to you on condition that you are bound by the covenant of Allah, meaning that you will administer it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  used to administer. So you took it from me on that condition. Then again you have come to me so that I decide between you other than that. I swear by Allah, I shall not decide between you other than that till the Last Hour comes. If you helpless, return it to me.   Abu Dawud said: They asked him for making it half between them, and not that they were ignorant of the fact the Prophet (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They were also seeking the truth. 'Umar then said: I do not apply the name of division to it ; It leave it on its former condition.
2964 | Narrating this tradition Malik b. Aws said:They i.e 'Ali and al-'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them), were quarrelling about what Allah bestowed on His Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), that is, the property of Banu al-Nadir.   Abu Dawud said: He ('Umar) intended that the name of division should not apply to it.
2965 | Narrated 'Umar: The properties of Banu al-Nadir were part of what Allah bestowed on His Apostle from what the Muslims has not ridden on horses or camels to get; so they belonged specially to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who gave his family their annual contribution.   Ibn 'Abdah said: His family (ahlihi) and not the members of his houses (ahl baitihi) ; then applied what remained for horses and weapons in Allah's path.
2966 | Narrated Al-Zuhri:'Umar said explaining the verse: "What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry" this belonged specially to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): lands of 'Urainah, Fadak, and so-and-so. What Allah as bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from the people of the townships - belong to Allah - to the Apostle, and to kindred and orphans, the needy and the wayfarer, to the indigent emigrants, those who were expelled from their homes and their property, and to those who, before them, had homes (in Medina), and had adopted the faith, and to those who came after them. This verse completely covered all the people ; they remained no one from Muslims but he had his right in it, or share (according to Ayyub's version) except the slaves.
2967 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      Malik ibn Aws al-Hadthan said: One of the arguments put forward by Umar was that he said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) received three things exclusively to himself: Banu an-Nadir, Khaybar and Fadak. The Banu an-Nadir property was kept wholly for his emergent needs, Fadak for travellers, and Khaybar was divided by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) into three sections: two for Muslims, and one as a contribution for his family. If anything remained after making the contribution of his family, he divided it among the poor Emigrants.
2968 | Narrated 'Aishah, wife of Prophet (ﷺ):Fatimah daughter of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent a messenger to Abu Bakr demanding from him in inheritance of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from what Allah bestowed on him at Medina and Fadak, and what remained of the fifth of Khaibar. Abu Bakr said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah. The family of Muhammad will eat from this property. I swear by Allah I shall not change it from the former condition of its being sadaqah as it was in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I shall deal with it as the Messenger of Allah dealt with it. Abu Bakr, therefore, refused to give anything to Fatimah from it.
2969 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Fatimah was demanding (the property of) sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at Medina and Fadak, and what remained from the fifth of Khaybar. Aisha quoted AbuBakr as saying: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited; whatever we leave is sadaqah. The family of Muhammad will eat from this property, that is, from the property of Allah. They will not take more then their sustenance.
2970 | Narrating the above tradition, 'Aishah added:Abu Bakr refused that to her. Her said: I am not going to leave anything the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do but I shall carry it out. I fear if I depart a little from his practice, I shall diverge (from the right path). As regards his sadaqah (property) at Medina, 'Umar had given it to 'Ali ad 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them), and 'Ali dominated it. As for Khaibar and Fadak, 'Umar retained them. He said: They were the sadaqah (property) of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), exclusively reserved for his purposes that happened, and for his emergent needs. Their management was assigned to the one who was in authority. He said: They are in that condition to the present day.
2971 | Al-Zuhri, explaining the verse "For this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry" said:The Prophet (ﷺ) concluded the treaty of peace with the people of Fadak and townships which he named which I could not remember ; he blockaded some other people who sent a message to him for capitulation. He said: "For this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry" means without fighting. Al-Zuhri said: The Banu al-Nadir property was exclusively kept for the Prophet (ﷺ) ; they did not conquer it by fighting, but conquered it by capitulation. To Prophet (ﷺ) divided it among the Emigrants. He did not give anything to the Helpers except two men were needy.
2972 | Narrated Umar ibn AbdulAziz:      Al-Mughirah (ibn Shu'bah) said: Umar ibn AbdulAziz gathered the family of Marwan when he was made caliph, and he said: Fadak belonged to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he made contributions from it, showing repeated kindness to the poor of the Banu Hashim from it, and supplying from it the cost of marriage for those who were unmarried. Fatimah asked him to give it to her, but he refused. That is how matters stood during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) till he passed on (i.e. died).        When AbuBakr was made ruler he administered it as the Prophet (ﷺ) had done in his lifetime till he passed on. Then when Umar ibn al-Khattab was made ruler he administered it as they had done till he passed on. Then it was given to Marwan as a fief, and it afterwards came to Umar ibn AbdulAziz.        Umar ibn AbdulAziz said: I consider I have no right to something which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) refused to Fatimah, and I call you to witness that I have restored it to its former condition; meaning in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).    Abu Dawud said: When 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz was made caliph its revenue was forty thousand dinars, and when he died its revenue was four hundred dinars. Had he remained alive, it would have been less than it.
2973 | Narrated AbuBakr:      AbutTufayl said: Fatimah came to AbuBakr asking him for the inheritance of the Prophet (ﷺ). AbuBakr said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If Allah, Most High, gives a Prophet some means of sustenance, that goes to his successor.
2974 | Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: Do not distribute dinars among my heirs: Whatever I left after contribution to my wives and provisions for my governor is sadaqah (alms).   Abu Dawud said: 'Amil means the workers or laborers on the land (i.e. peasants).
2975 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      AbulBakhtari said: I heard from a man a tradition which I liked. I said to him: Write it down for me. So he brought it clearly written to me.        (It says): Al-Abbas and Ali entered upon Umar when Talhah, az-Zubayr, AbdurRahman and Sa'd were with him. They (Abbas and Ali) were disputing.        Umar said to Talhah, az-Zubayr, AbdurRahman and Sa'd: Do you not know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: All the property of the Prophet (ﷺ) is sadaqah (alms), except what he provided for his family for their sustenance and their clothing. We are not to be inherited.        They said: Yes, indeed.  He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to spend from his property on his family, and give the residue as sadaqah (alms). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then died, and AbuBakr ruled for two years. He would deal with it in the same manner as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did. He then mentioned a little from the tradition of Malik ibn Aws.
2976 | Narrated 'Aishah:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) intended to send 'Uthman b. 'Affan to Abu Bakr to ask him their cost of living from (the inheritance of) the Prophet (ﷺ). Thereupon 'Aishah said: Did not the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah.
2977 | A similar tradition has been narrated by Ibn Shihab through a different chain of narrators. This version says:I said: Do you not fear Allah ? Did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). This property belongs to the family of Muhammad for their emergent needs and their guest. When I die, it will go to him who becomes ruler after me.
2978 | Narrated Jubair b. Mut'im:That he and 'Uthman b. 'Affan went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) talking to him about the fifth which he divided among the Banu Hisham and Abu 'Abd al-Muttalib. I said: Messenger of Allah, you have divided (the fifth) among our brethren Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib, but you have not given us anything, though our relationship to you is the same as theirs. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The Banu Hisham and the Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib are one. Jubair said: He did not divide the fifth among the Banu 'Abd Shams and the Banu Nawfal as he divided among the Banu Hashim and the Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib. He said: Abu Bakr used to divide the fifth like the division of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) except that he did not give the relatives of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), as he gave them. 'Umar b. al-Khattab and 'Uthman after him used to give them (a portion) from it.
2979 | Narrated Jubair b. Mu'tim:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not divide the fifth among the Banu 'Abd Shams and Banu Nawfal as he divided among the Banu Hashim and Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib. He said: Abu Bakr used to divide (the fifth) like the division of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), except that he did not give the relatives of the Messenger of Allah as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) himself gave them. 'Umar used to give them (from the fifth) and those who followed him.
2980 | Narrated Jubair b. Mu'tim:On the day of Khaibar the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) divided the portion to his relatives among the Banu Hashim and Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib, and omitted Banu Nawfal and Banu 'Abd Shams. So  I and 'Utham b. 'Affan went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and we said: Messenger of Allah, these are Banu Hashim whose superiority we do not deny because if the position in which Allah has placed you in relation to them ; but tell us about Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib to whom you have given something while omitting us though our relationship is the same as theirs. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is no distinction between us and Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib in pre-Islamic days and in Islam. We and they are one, and he (ﷺ) intertwined his fingers.
2981 | Explaining the relatives of the Prophet (ﷺ) al-Saddi said:They are Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib.
2982 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Yazid ibn Hurmuz said that when Najdah al-Haruri performed hajj during the rule of Ibn az-Zubayr, he sent someone to Ibn Abbas to ask him about the portion of the relatives (in the fifth). He asked: For whom do you think?  Ibn Abbas replied: For the relatives of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) divided it among them. Umar presented it to us but we found it less than our right. We, therefore returned it to him and refused to accept it.
2983 | Narrated 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abi Laila:I heard 'Ali say: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) assigned me the fifth (of the booty). I spent it on its beneficiaries during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr and of 'Umar. Some property was brought to him ('Umar) and he called me and said: Take it. I said: I dod not want it. He said: Take it ; you have right to it. I said: We do not need it. So he deposited in the government treasury.
2984 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      I, al-Abbas, Fatimah and Zayd ibn Harithah gathered with the Prophet (ﷺ) and I said: Messenger of Allah, if you think to assign us our right (portion) in this fifth ( of the booty) as mentioned in the Book of Allah, and this I may divide during your lifetime so that no one may dispute me after you, then do it. He said: He did that. He said: I divided it during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). AbuBakr then assigned it to me. During the last days of the caliphate of Umar a good deal of property came to him and took out our portion. I said to him: We are well to do this year; but the Muslims are needy, so return it to them. He, therefore, returned it to them. No one called me after Umar. I met al-Abbas when I came out from Umar. He said: Ali, today you have deprived us of a thing that will never be returned to us. He was indeed a man of wisdom.
2985 | Narrated AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith:      AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith said that his father, Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith, and Abbas ibn al-Muttalib said to AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah and al-Fadl ibn Abbas: Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and tell him: Messenger of Allah, we are now of age as you see, and we wish to marry. Messenger of Allah, you are the kindest of the people and the most skilled in matchmaking. Our fathers have nothing with which to pay our dower. So appoint us collector of sadaqah (zakat), Messenger of Allah, and we shall give you what the other collectors give you, and we shall have the benefit accruing from it. Ali came to us while we were in this condition.        He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No, I swear by Allah, he will not appoint any of you collector of sadaqah (zakat).        Rabi'ah said to him: This is your condition; you have gained your relationship with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) by marriage, but we did not grudge you that. Ali then put his cloak on the earth and lay on it.        He then said: I am the father of Hasan, the chief. I swear by Allah, I shall not leave this place until your sons come with a reply (to the question) for which you have sent them to the Prophet (ﷺ).        AbdulMuttalib said: So I and al-Fadl went towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (ﷺ). We found that the noon prayer in congregation had already started. So we prayed along with the people. I and al-Fadl then hastened towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (ﷺ). He was (staying) with Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, that day. We stood until the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came. He caught my ear and the ear of al-Fadl.        He then said: Reveal what you conceal in your hearts. He then entered  and permitted me and al-Fadl (to enter). So we entered and for a little while we asked each other to talk. I then talked to him, or al-Fadl talked to him (the narrator, Abdullah was not sure).        He said: He spoke to him concerning the matter about which our fathers ordered us to ask him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent for a moment and raised his eyes towards the ceiling of the room. He took so long that we thought he would not give any reply to us. Meanwhile we saw that Zaynab was signalling to us with her hand from behind the veil, asking us not to be in a hurry, and that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was (thinking) about our matter.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then lowered his head and said to us: This sadaqah (zakat) is a dirt of the people. It is legal neither for Muhammad nor for the family of Muhammad. Call Nawfal ibn al-Harith to me. So Nawfal ibn al-Harith was called to him.        He said: Nawfal, marry AbdulMuttalib (to your daughter). So Nawfal married me (to his daughter).        The Prophet (ﷺ) then said: Call Mahmiyyah ibn Jaz'i to me. He was a man of Banu Zubayd, whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had appointed collector of the fifths.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Mahmiyyah: Marry al-Fadl (to your daughter). So he married him to her. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Stand up and pay the dower from the fifth so-and-so on their behalf. Abdullah ibn al-Harith did not name it (i.e. the amount of the dower).
2986 | ‘Ali bin Abi Talib said “I had an old she Camel that I got as my share from the booty on the day of Badr. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) also gave me an old she camel from the fifth that day. When I intended to cohabit with Fathimah daughter of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I made arrangement with a man who was a goldsmith belonging to Banu Qainuqa’ to go with me so that we may bring grass. I intended to sell it to the goldsmith there by seeking help in my wedding feast. While I was collecting for my old Camels saddles, baskets and ropes both of she Camels were seated in a corner of the apartment of a man of the Ansar. When I collected what I collected (i.e., equipment) I turned (towards them). I suddenly found that the humps of she Camels were cut off and their hips were pierced and their lives were taken out. I could not control my eyes (to weep) when I saw that scene. I said “Who has done this?” They (the people) replied “Hamzah bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib”. He is among the drunkards of the Ansar in this house. A singing girl is singing for him and his Companions. While singing she said “Oh Hamza, rise to these plumpy old she Camels. So he jumped to the sword and cut off their humps, pierced their hips and took out their livers.” ‘Ali said “I went till I entered upon the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) while Zaid bin Harithah was with him.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) realized what I had met with. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) aid “What is the matter with you?” I said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I never saw the thing that happened with me today. Hamzah wronged my she Camels, he cut off their humps, pierced their hips. Lo! He is in a house with drunkards. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) asked for his cloak. It was brought to him. He then went out, I and Zaid bin Harithah followed him until we reached the house where Hamzah was. He asked permission ( to entre). He was permitted. He found drunkards there. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) began to rebuke him (Hamzah) for his action. Hamzah was intoxicated and his eyes were reddish. Hamzah looked at the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). He then raised his eyes and looked at his knees, he then raised his eyes and looked at his navel and he then raised his eyes and looked at his face. Hamzah then said “Are you but the salves of my father? Then the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) knew that he was intoxicated. So the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) moved backward. He then went out and we also went out with him.”
2987 | Umm Al Hakam or Duba’ah daughters of Al Zibair bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib said “Some captives of war were brought to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). I and my sister Fatimah, daughter of Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went (to the Prophet) and complained to him about our existing condition. We asked him to order (to give) us some captives. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “the orphans of the people who were killed in the battle of Badr came before you (and they asked for the captives). But I tell you something better than that. You should utter “Allaah is Most Great” after each prayer thirty three times, “Glory be to Allaah” thirty three times, “Praise be to Allaah” thirty three times and “there is no god but Allaah alone, He has no associate, the Kingdom belongs to Him and praise is due to Him and He has power over all things.”   The narrator ‘Ayyash said “They were daughters of Uncle of the Prophet (ﷺ).”
2988 | Ibn A’bud said, ‘Ali said to me “May I not narrate you about me and Fathimah daughter of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)? She was most favorite to him of his family.” I said “Yes”. He said “She pulled the grinding stone with her hand so much that it affected her hand, she carried water in a water bag so much so that it affected the upper portion of her chest, she swept the house so much so that her clothes became dirty. The Prophet (ﷺ) acquired some slaves”. So I said “Would that you go to your father and ask him for a slave. She then came to him and found some people with him talking to him. She therefore returned. Next day she came again. He asked (her), what was your need? But she kept silence. So I said, I inform you, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). She pulled grinding stone so much that it affected her hand, she carried water bag so much so that it affected the upper portion of her chest. When the slaves were brought to you I asked her to come to you and to ask you for a slave to save her from the exertion she is suffering.” He said “Fear Allaah, Fathimah and perform the duty of your Lord and do the work of your family.”  When you go to bed say “Glory be to Allaah” thirty three times, “Praise be to Allaah” thirty three times, “Allaah is Most Great” thirty four times. This is hundred times. That will be better for you than a servant. She said “I am pleased with Allaah, Most High and with his Apostle (ﷺ).”
2989 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by ‘Ali bin Hussain through a different chain of narrators. This version adds “He (the Prophet) did not provide her with a slave.”
2990 | Narrated Mujja'ah ibn Mirarah al-Yamani:      Mujja'ah went to the Prophet (ﷺ) asking him for the blood-money of his brother whom Banu Sadus from Banu Dhuhl had killed.        The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Had I appointed blood-money for a polytheist, I should have appointed it for your brother. But I shall give you compensation for him. So the Prophet (ﷺ) wrote (a document) for him that he should be given a hundred camels which were to be acquired from the fifth taken from the polytheists of Banu Dhuhl. So he took a part of them, for Banu Dhuhl embraced Islam.        He then asked AbuBakr for them later on, and brought to him the document of the Prophet (ﷺ). So AbuBakr wrote for him that he should be given one thousand two hundred sa's from the sadaqah of al-Yamamah; four thousand (sa's) of wheat, four thousand (sa's) of barley, and four thousand (sa's) of dates.        The text of the document written by the Prophet (ﷺ) for Mujja'ah was as follows: "In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. This document is from Muhammad, the Prophet, to Mujja'ah ibn Mirarah of Banu Sulma. I have given him one hundred camels from the first fifth acquired from the polytheist of Banu Dhuhl as a compensation for his brother."
2991 | ‘Amir Al Sha’bi said “The Prophet (ﷺ) had a special portion in the booty called safi. This would be a slave if he desired or a slave girl if he desired or a horse if he desired. He would choose it before taking out the fifth.”
2992 | Ibn ‘Awn said “I asked Muhammad about the portion of the prophet(ﷺ) and safi. He replied “A portion was taken for him along with the Muslims, even if he did not attend (the battle) and safi (special portion) was taken from the fifth before everything.”
2993 | Qatadah said “When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) participated in battle there was for him a special portion which he took from where he desired. Safiyyah was from that portion. But when he did not participate himself in his battle, a portion was taken out for him, but he had no choice.”
2994 | A’ishah said “Safiyyah was called after the word safi (a special portion of the Prophet).”
2995 | Anas bin Malik said “We came to Khaibar. We bestowed the conquest of fortress (on us), the beauty of Safiyyah daughter of Huyayy was mentioned to him (the Prophet). Her husband was killed (in the battle) and she was a bride. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) chose her for himself. He came out with her till we reached Sadd Al Sahba’ where she was purified. So he cohabited with her.
2996 | Anas bin Malik said “Safiyyah first fell to Dihyat Al Kalbi, the she fell to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ).
2997 | Anas said “A beautiful slave girl fell to Dihyah”. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) purchased her for seven slaves. He then gave her to Umm Sulaim for decorating her and preparing her for marriage. The narrator Hammad said, I think he said “Safiyyah daughter of Huyayy should pass her waiting period in her (Umm Sulaims’) house.”
2998 | Anas said “Captives were gathered at Khaibar. Dihyah came out and said “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) give me a slave girl from the captives.” He said “Go and take a slave girl. He took Safiyyah daughter of Huyayy. A man then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said “You gave Safiyyah daughter of Huyayy, chief lady of Quraizah and Al Nadir to Dihyah? This is according to the version of Ya’qub. Then the agreed version goes “she is worthy of you.” He said “call him along with her. When the Prophet (ﷺ) looked at her, he said to him “take another slave girl from the captives. The Prophet (ﷺ) then set her free and married her.
2999 | Narrated Yazid ibn Abdullah:      We were at Mirbad. A man with dishevelled hair and holding a piece of red skin in his hand came.        We said: You appear to be a bedouin.  He said: Yes.  We said: Give us this piece of skin in your hand. He then gave it to us and we read it. It contained the text: "From Muhammad, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), to Banu Zuhayr ibn Uqaysh. If you bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, offer prayer, pay zakat, pay the fifth from the booty, and the portion of the Prophet (ﷺ) and his special portion (safi), you will be under by the protection of Allah and His Apostle."        We then asked: Who wrote this document for you?  He replied: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
3000 | Ka’ab bin Malik who was one of those whose repentance was accepted said “Ka’ab bin Al Ashraf used to satire the Prophet (ﷺ) and incited the infidels of the Quraish against him. When the Prophet (ﷺ) came to Madeena, its people were intermixed, some of them were Muslims and others polytheists aho worshipped idols and some were Jews. They used to hurt the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions. Then Allaah Most High commanded His Prophet to show patience and forgiveness. So Allaah revealed about them “And ye shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who receive Book before you”. When Ka’ab bin Al Ashraf refused to desist from hurting the Prophet (ﷺ) the Prophet(ﷺ) ordered Sa’d bin Mu’adh to send a band to kill him. He sent Muhammad bin Maslamah and mentioned the story of his murder. When they killed him, the Jews and the polytheist were frightened. Next day they came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said “Our Companions were attacked and night and killed.” The Prophet(ﷺ) informed them about that which he would say. The Prophet (ﷺ) then called them so that he could write a deed of agreement between him and them and they should fulfill its provisions and desist from hurting him. He then wrote a deed of agreement between him and them and the Muslims in general.”
3001 | Ibn ‘Abbas said “When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) had victory over Quraish in the batte of Badr and came to Madeenah he gathered the Jews in the market of Banu Qainuqa and said “O community of Jews embrace Islam before you suffer an injury as the Quraish suffered.” They said “Muhammad, you should not deceive yourself (taking pride) that you had killed a few persons of the Quariash who were inexperienced and did not know how to fight. Had you fought with us, you would have known us. You have never met people like us.” Allah Most High revealed about this the following verse “Say to those who reject faith, soon will ye be vanished... one army was fighting in the cause of Allaah, the other resisting Allaah.”
3002 | Narrated Muhayyisah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If you gain a victory over the men of Jews, kill them. So Muhayyisah jumped over Shubaybah, a man of the Jewish merchants. He had close relations with them. He then killed him. At that time Huwayyisah (brother of Muhayyisah) had not embraced Islam. He was older than Muhayyisah. When he killed him, Huwayyisah beat him and said: O enemy of Allah, I swear by Allah, you have a good deal of fat in your belly from his property.
3003 | Abu Hurairah said, While we were in the mosque, the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) came out and said “Come on to the Jews. So we went out with him and came to them”. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) stood up, called them and said “If you, the community of Jews accept Islam you will be safe”. They said “You have given the message Abu Al Qasim”. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Accept Islam you will be safe”. They said “You have given the message Abu Al Qasim”. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “that I intended”. He then said the third time “Know that the land belongs to Allaah and His Apostle and I intend to deport you from this land. So, if any of you has property (he cannot take it away), he must sell it, otherwise know that the land belongs to Allaah and His Apostle (ﷺ).”
3004 | Narrated A man from the companions of the Prophet:      AbdurRahman ibn Ka'b ibn Malik reported on the authority of a man from among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ): The infidels of the Quraysh wrote (a letter) to Ibn Ubayy and to those who worshipped idols from al-Aws and al-Khazraj, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was at that time at Medina before the battle of Badr.        (They wrote): You gave protection to our companion. We swear by Allah, you should fight him or expel him, or we shall come to you in full force, until we kill your fighters and appropriate your women.        When this (news) reached Abdullah ibn Ubayy and those who were worshippers of idols, with him they gathered together to fight the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        When this news reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he visited them and said: The threat of the Quraysh to you has reached its end. They cannot contrive a plot against you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this from the Prophet (ﷺ), they scattered. This reached the infidels of the Quraysh.        The infidels of the Quraysh again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter reached the Prophet (ﷺ), they gathered Banu an-Nadir to violate the treaty.        They sent a message to the Prophet (ﷺ): Come out to us with thirty men from your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator then narrated the whole story.        When the next day came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out in the morning with an army, and surrounded them.        He told them: I swear by Allah, you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with me. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore fought them the same day.        Next he attacked Banu Quraysh with an army in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to sign a treaty and they signed it.        He turned away from them and attacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until they agreed to expulsion. Banu an-Nadir were deported, and they took with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their property, the doors of their houses, and their wood. Palm-trees were exclusively reserved for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Allah bestowed them upon him and gave them him as a special portion.        He (Allah), the Exalted, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them, for this ye made no expedition with either camel corps or cavalry." He said: "Without fighting." So the Prophet (ﷺ) gave most of it to the emigrants and divided it among them; and he divided some of it between two men from the helpers, who were needy, and he did not divide it among any of the helpers except those two. The rest of it survived as the sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) which is in the hands of the descendants of Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her).
3005 | Ibn ‘Umar said “The Jews Al Nadir and Quraizah fought with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), so the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) expelled Banu Al Nadir and allowed the Quraizah to stay and favored them. The Quraizah thereafter fought (with the Prophet).” So he killed their men and divided their women, property and children among Muslims except some of them who associated with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). He gave them protection and later on they embraced Islam. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) expelled all the Jews of Madeenah in Toto, Banu Qainuqa, they were the people of ‘Abd Allaah bin Salam, the Jews of Banu Harith  and any of Jews who resided in Madeenah.
3006 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Umar:      The Prophet fought with the people of Khaybar, and captured their palm-trees and land, and forced them to remain confined to their fortresses. So they concluded a treaty of peace providing that gold, silver and weapons would go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and whatever they took away on their camels would belong to them, on condition that they would not hide and carry away anything. If they did (so), there would be no protection for them and no treaty (with Muslims).        They carried away a purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab who was killed before (the battle of) Khaybar. He took away the ornaments of Banu an-Nadir when they were expelled.        The Prophet (ﷺ) asked Sa'yah: Where is the purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab?        He replied: The contents of this purse were spent on battles and other expenses. (Later on) they found the purse. So he killed Ibn AbulHuqayq, captured their women and children, and intended to deport them.        They said: Muhammad, leave us to work on this land; we shall have half (of the produce) as you wish, and you will have half. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to make a contribution of eighty wasqs of dates and twenty wasqs of wheat to each of his wives.
3007 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had transaction with the Jews of Khaybar on condition that we should expel them when we wish. If anyone has property (with them), he should take it back, for I am going to expel the Jews. So he expelled them.
3008 | ‘Abd Allah bin ‘Umar reported that ‘Umar said “When Khaibar was conquered, the Jews asked the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) to confirm that they would do all the cultivation and have half the produce. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “I shall confirm you on that condition as long as we wish. So they were confirmed on that (condition). The dates from half the produce of Khaibar were divided into a number of portions. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) would take the fifth. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) used to contribute from the fifth one hundred wasqs of dates and twenty wasqs of wheat to each of his wives. When ‘Umar intended to expel the Jews from Khaibar he sent a message to the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) and said to them “If any of you wishes that I divide the palm trees for her by their assessment that amounts one hundred wasqs (of dates) and to her belongs their root, their land and their water and (likewise) twenty wasqs from the produce of the cultivated land by assessment, I shall (do that). And if any of you wishes that we take out her portion from the fifth, we shall do (that).
3009 | Anas bin Malik said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) attacked Khaibar and we captured it by conquest. He then gathered the captives of war.”
3010 | Sahl bin Abi Hathmah said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) divide Khaibar into two halves. One half was reserved for his emergency and needs, the other half was meant for the Muslims. He divided among them into eighteen portions.”
3011 | Bashir bin Yasar said that he heard a number of the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) say. He then narrated the tradition (mentioned above). He said “One half comprised the portions of the Muslims and the portion of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). He separated the other half for the Muslims for any calamity that befalls him and for emergent needs.”
3012 | Narrated A Group of Companions of the Prophet:      Bashir ibn Yasar, the client of the Ansar, reported on the authority of a group of the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ): When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) conquered Khaybar, he divided it into thirty-six lots, each lot comprising one hundred portions. One half of it was for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and for the Muslims; and he separated the remaining half for the deputations which came to him, other matters and emergent needs of the people.
3013 | Bashir bin Yasar said “When Allaah bestowed Khaibar on His Prophet (ﷺ) as fai’ (spoils), he divided it into thirty six lots. Each lot comprised one hundred portions. He separated its half for his emergent needs and whatever befalls him. Al Watih and Al Kutaibah and Al Salalim and whatever acquired with them. He separated the other half and he divided Al Shaqq and Nata’ and whatever acquired with them. The portion of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) lay in the property acquired with them.
3014 | Narrated Bashir ibn Yasar:      When Allah bestowed Khaybar on the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as fay' (spoils of war without fighting), he divided the whole into thirty six lots. He put aside a half, i.e. eighteen lots, for the Muslims. Each lot comprised one hundred shares, and the Prophet (ﷺ) was with them. He received a share like the share of one of them.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) separated eighteen lots, that is, half, for his future needs and whatever befell the Muslims. These were al-Watih, al-Kutaybah, as-Salalim and their colleagues. When all this property came in the possession of the Prophet (ﷺ) and of the Muslims, they did not have sufficient labourers to work on it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called Jews and employed them on contract.
3015 | Narrated Mujammi' ibn Jariyah al-Ansari,:      Khaybar was divided among the people of al-Hudaybiyyah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) divided it into eighteen portions. The army contained one thousand and five hundred people. There were three hundred horsemen among them. He gave double share to the horsemen, and a single to the footmen.
3016 | Narrated Abdullah ibn AbuBakr:      Abdullah ibn AbuBakr and some children of Muhammad ibn Maslamah said: There remained some people of Khaybar and they confined themselves to the fortresses. They asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to protect their lives and let them go. He did so. The people of Fadak heard this; they also adopted a similar way. (Fadak) was, therefore, exclusively reserved for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), for it was not captured by the expedition of cavalry and camelry.
3017 | Sa’id bin Al Musayyab said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) conquered a portion of Khaibar by force.”   Abu Dawud said “This tradition was read out to Al Harith bin Miskin while I was a witness”. Ibn Wahb said “Malik told me on the authority of Ibn Shihab, Khaibar was captured by force in part and by peace in part. Most of Al Kutaibah was captured by force and a portion by peace.” I asked Malik “What is Al Kutaibah?” He replied “The land of Khaibar. It had forty thousand palm trees.”
3018 | Ibn Shihab said “It has reached me that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) conquered Khaibar by force. Its inhabitants who came down (from their fortress) for expulsion came down after fighting.”
3019 | Narrated Ibn Shihab:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took out his fifth from the booty of Khaybar, and divided the rest of it among those who attended the battle and among those who were away from it but attend the expedition of al-Hudaybiyyah.
3020 | ‘Umar said “Had I not considered the last Muslim, I would have any town I conquered divided as the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) had divided Khaibar.”
3021 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Al-Abbas ibn AbdulMuttalib brought AbuSufyan ibn Harb to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the year of the conquest (of Mecca). So he embraced Islam at Marr az-Zahran. Al-Abbas said to him: Messenger of Allah, AbuSufyan is a man who likes taking this pride, if you may do something for him.  He said: Yes, he who enters the house of AbuSufyan is safe, and he who closes his door is safe.
3022 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) alighted at Marr az-Zahran, al-Abbas said: I thought, I swear by Allah, if the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) enters Mecca with the army by force before the Quraysh come to him and seek protection from him, it will be their total ruin. So I rode on the mule of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and thought, Perhaps I may find a man coming for his needs who will to the people of Mecca and inform them of the position of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), so that they may come to him and seek protection from him. While I was on my way, I heard AbuSufyan and Budayl ibn Warqa' speaking.        I said: O AbuHanzalah!  He recognized my voice and said: AbulFadl?  I replied: Yes.  He said: who is with you, may my parents be a sacrifice for you?  I said: Here are the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his people (with him).        He asked: Which is the way out?  He said: He rode behind me, and his companion returned. When the morning came, I brought him to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he embraced Islam.        I said: Messenger of Allah, AbuSufyan is a man who likes this pride, do something for him.  He said: Yes, he who enters the house of AbuSufyan is safe; he who closes the door upon him is safe; and he who enters the mosque is safe. The people scattered to their houses and in the mosque.
3023 | Wahb bin Munabbih said “I sked Jabir “Did they get any booty on the day of conquest (of Makkah)? He replied, No.
3024 | Abu Hurairah said “When the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Makkah he left Al Zubair bin Al Awwam, Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al Jarrah and Khalid bin Al Walid on the horses and he said “Abu Hurairah call the helpers.” He said”Go this way. Whoever appears before you kill him”. A man called “the Quraish will be no more after today.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “he who entered house is safe, he who throws the weapon is safe. The chiefs of the Quraish intended (to have a resort in the Ka’bah), they entered the Ka’bah and it was full of them. The Prophet (ﷺ) took rounds of Ka’bah and prayed behind the station. He then held the sides of the gate (of the Ka’bah). They (the people) came out and took the oath of allegiance (at the hands) of the Prophet (ﷺ) on Islam.   Abu Dawud said “I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal (say) when he was asked by a man “Was Makkah captured by force?” He said “What harms you whatever it was? He said “Then by peace?” He said, No.
3025 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      Wahb said: I asked Jabir about the condition of Thaqif when they took the oath of allegiance. He said: They stipulated to the Prophet (ﷺ) that there would be no sadaqah (i.e. zakat) on them nor Jihad (striving in the way of Allah). He then heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: Later on they will give sadaqah (zakat) and will strive in the way of Allah when they embrace Islam.
3026 | Narrated Uthman ibn Abul'As:      When the deputation of Thaqif came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he made them stay in the mosque, so that it might soften their hearts. They stipulated to him that they would not be called to participate in Jihad, to pay zakat and to offer prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You may have the concession that you will not be called to participate in jihad and pay zakat, but there is no good in a religion which has no bowing (i.e. prayer).
3027 | Narrated Amir ibn Shahr:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) appeared as a prophet, Hamdan said to me: Will you go to this man and negotiate for us (with him)? If you accept something, we shall accept it, and if you disapprove of something, we shall disapprove of it.        I said: Yes. So I proceeded until I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I liked his motive and my people embraced Islam. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote the document for Umayr Dhu Marran. He also sent Malik ibn Murarah ar-Rahawi to all the (people of) Yemen. So Akk Dhu Khaywan embraced Islam.        Akk was told: Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and obtain his protection for your town and property. He therefore came (to him) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote a document for him:        "In the name of Allah, Most Beneficent, Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Akk Dhu Khaywan. If he is true his land, property and slave, he has the security and the protection of Allah, and Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah. Written by Khalid ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As."
3028 | Narrated Abyad ibn Hammal:      Abyad spoke to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about sadaqah when he came along with a deputation to him.        He replied: O brother of Saba', sadaqah is unavoidable.  He said: We cultivated cotton, Messenger of Allah. The people of Saba' scattered, and there remained only a few at Ma'arib.       He therefore concluded a treaty of peace with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to give seventy suits of cloth, equivalent to the price of the Yemeni garments known as al-mu'afir, to be paid every year on behalf of those people of Saba' who remained at Ma'arib.       They continued to pay them till the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died.       The governors after the death of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) broke the treaty concluded by Abyad by Hammal with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to give seventy suits of garments.       AbuBakr then revived it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had done till AbuBakr died. When AbuBakr died, it was discontinued and the sadaqah was levied.
3029 | Ibn ‘Abbas said that the Prophet (ﷺ) gave three instructions saying “Expel the polytheists from Arabia, reward deputations as I did”. Ibn ‘Abbas said “He either did not mention the third or I have been caused to forget it. Al Humaidi said on the authority of Sufyan that Sulaiman said “I do not know whether Sa’id mentioned the third and I forgot or he himself did not mention it.”
3030 | Jabir bin ‘Abd Allah said that he was told by ‘Umar bin Al Khattab that he heard the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) say “I will certainly expel the Jews and the Christians from Arabia and I shall leave only Muslims in it.”
3031 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by ‘Umar through a different chain of narrators.” He said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said to the same effect. The former version is ore perfect.”
3032 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Two qiblahs in one land are not right.
3033 | Sa’id bin Abd Al ‘Aziz said “Arabia lies between Al Wadi to the extremes of the Yemen extending to the frontiers of Al Iraq and the sea.”   Abu Dawud said “This tradition was read out to Al Harith bin Miskin while I was a witness”. Ashhab bin ‘Abd Al Aziz reported it to you on the authority of Malik who said ‘Umar expelled the people of Najran, but he did not expel (them) from Taima. For it did not fall within the territory of Arabia. As for Al Wadi, I think the Jews were not expelled from there. They did not think it a part of the land of Arabia.
3034 | Malik said “’Umar expelled the Jews of Najran and Fadak.”
3035 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying “Iraq will prevent its measure (qafiz) and dirham. Syria will prevent its measure (mudi) and dinar. Egypt will prevent its measure (irdabb) and dinar. Then you will return to the position where you started. Zuhair said this three times. The flesh and blood of Abu Hurairah witnessed it.
3036 | Abu Hurairah reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “Whatever town you come to and stay in , your portion is in it, but whatever town disobeys Allaah and His Apostle a fifth of it goes to Allaah and His Apostle and what remains is yours.”
3037 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik ; Uthman ibn AbuSulayman:      The Prophet (ﷺ) sent Khalid ibn al-Walid to Ukaydir of Dumah. He was seized and they brought him to him (i.e. the Prophet). He spared his life and made peace with him on condition that he should pay jizyah (poll-tax).
3038 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      When the Prophet (ﷺ) sent him to the Yemen, he ordered to take from everyone who had reached puberty one dinar or its equivalent in Mu'afiri garment of Yemen origin.
3039 | A simiar tradition from the Prophet(ﷺ) has also been transmitted by Mu’adh through a different chain of narrators.
3040 | ‘Ali said “If I survive for the Christians of Banu Taghlib I shall kill fighters and captivate children for I had written a document between them and the Prophet(ﷺ) to the effect that they would not make their children Christian.   Abu Dawud said “This is rejected (munkar) tradition and it has reached me from Ahmad (bin Hanbal) that he used to reject this tradition seriously.   Abu ‘Ali said “Abu Dawud did not present this (tradition) in this second reading.”
3041 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) concluded peace with the people of Najran on condition that they would pay to Muslims two thousand suits of garments, half of Safar, and the rest in Rajab, and they would lend (Muslims) thirty coats of mail, thirty horses, thirty camels, and thirty weapons of each type used in battle. Muslims will stand surely for them until they return them in case there is any plot or treachery in the Yemen. No church of theirs will be demolished and no clergyman of theirs will be turned out. There will be no interruption in their religion until they bring something new or take usury. Isma'il said: They took usury.   Abu Dawud said: If they violate any provision of the treaty, they will be deemed as bringing something new.
3042 | Ibn ‘Abbas said “When the Prophet of the Persians dies, Iblis (satan) led them to Mazdaism.”
3043 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      Amr ibn Aws and AbulSha'tha' reported that Bujalah said: I was secretary to Jaz' ibn Mu'awiyah, the uncle of Ahnaf ibn Qays.        A letter came to us from Umar one year before his death, saying: Kill every magician, separate the relatives of prohibited degrees from the Magians, and forbid them to murmur (before eating). So we killed three magicians in one day, and separated from a Magian husband his wife of a prohibited degree according to the Book of Allah.        He prepared abundant food and called them, and placed the sword on his thigh. They ate (the food) but did not murmur. They threw (on the ground) one or two mule-loads of silver. Umar did not take jizyah from Magians until AbdurRahman ibn Awf witnessed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had taken jizyah from the Magians of Hajar.
3044 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A man belonging to Usbadhiyin of the people of Bahrayn, who were the Magians of Hajar, came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and remained with him (for some time), and then came out. I asked him: What have Allah and His Messenger of Allah decided for you? He replied: Evil. I said: Silent. He said: Islam or killing. AbdurRahman ibn Awf said: He accepted jizyah from them. Ibn Abbas said: The people followed the statement of AbdurRahman ibn Awf, and they left that which I heard from the Usbadhi.
3045 | ‘Urwa bin Al Zubair said “Hisham bin Halim bin Hizam found a man who was the governor of Hims making some Copts stand in the sun for the payment of jizyah. He said “What is this?” I heard the Apostle (ﷺ) as saying “Allaah Most High will punish those who punish the people in this world.”
3046 | Narrated Ubaydullah:      Harb ibn Ubaydullah told on the authority of his grandfather, his mother's father, that he had it on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Tithes are to be levied on Jews and Christians, but not on Muslims.
3047 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Harb bin ‘Ubaid Allah from the Prophet (ﷺ) to the same effect through a different chain of narrators. This version has the word kharaj(land tax) instead of ‘ushr (tithes).
3048 | A man reported from Bakr bin Wa’il on the authority of his maternal uncle as saying, I said “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) may I levy tithe on my people.?” He replied “Tithes are to be levied on Jews and Christians.”
3049 | Narrated A man of Banu Taghlib:      Harb ibn Ubaydullah ibn Umayr ath-Thaqafi told on the authority of his grandfather, a man of Banu Taghlib: I came to the Prophet (ﷺ), embraced Islam, and he taught me Islam. He also taught me how I should take sadaqah from my people who had become Muslim. I then returned to him and said: Messenger of Allah, I remembered whatever you taught me except the sadaqah. Should I levy tithe on them? He replied: No, tithes are to be levied on Christians and Jews.
3050 | Narrated Al-Irbad ibn Sariyah as-Sulami:      We alighted with the Prophet (ﷺ) at Khaybar, and he had his companions with him. The chief of Khaybar was a defiant and abominable man.        He came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Is it proper for you, Muhammad, that you slaughter our donkeys, eat our fruit, and beat our women?        The Prophet (ﷺ) became angry and said: Ibn Awf, ride your horse, and call loudly: Beware, Paradise is lawful only for a believer, and that they (the people) should gather for prayer.        They gathered and the Prophet (ﷺ) led them in prayer, stood up and said: Does any of you, while reclining on his couch, imagine that Allah has prohibited only that which is to be found in this Qur'an? By Allah, I have preached, commanded and prohibited various matters as numerous as that which is found in the Qur'an, or more numerous. Allah has not permitted you to enter the houses of the people of the Book without permission, or beat their women, or eat their fruits when they give you that which is imposed on them.
3051 | Narrated A man of Juhaynah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Probably you will fight with a people, you will dominate them, and they will save themselves and their children by their property. The version of Sa'id has You will then conclude peace with them. The agreed version goes: Then do no take anything from them more than that, for it is not proper for you.
3052 | Narrated A number of Companions of the Prophet:      Safwan reported from a number of Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the authority of their fathers who were relatives of each other. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Beware, if anyone wrongs a contracting man, or diminishes his right, or forces him to work beyond his capacity, or takes from him anything without his consent, I shall plead for him on the Day of Judgment.
3053 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Jizyah is not to be levied on a Muslim.
3054 | Muhammad bin Kathir said “Sufyan was asked to explain the tradition mentioned above.” He said “When he embraces Islam, no jizyah will be levied on him.”
3055 | Narrated Abdullah al-Hawzani:      I met Bilal, the Mu'adhdhin of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at Aleppo, and said: Bilal, tell me, what was the financial position of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?        He said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and feed him.        A man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body of merchants.        When he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian.  I said: I am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said harsh words to me.  He asked me: Do you know how many days remain in the completion of this month?  I replied: The time is near.  He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned to his family. I sought permission from him and he gave me permission.        I said: Messenger of Allah, may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (ﷺ) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I intended to be on my way.        All of a sudden I saw a man running towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So I went till I reached him. I found four mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought permission.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling on the ground?        I replied: Yes.  He said: You may have these mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and pay off your debt. I did so.        He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting there. I greeted him.        He asked: What benefit did you have from your property?  I replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Nothing remains now.        He asked: Did anything remain (from that property)?  I said: Yes.  He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some comfort from it. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)?        I said: I still have it, no one came to me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed the night in the mosque.        He then narrated the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)?        I replied: Allah has given you comfort from it, Messenger of Allah.  He said: Allah is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die while it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his wives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his place where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you asked me.
3056 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Mu’awiyah through a different chain of narrators to the same effect as narrated by Abu Taubah. This version has “I have nothing to pay from me. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) thereupon kept silence and this displeased me.”
3057 | Narrated Iyad ibn Himar:      I presented a she-camel to the Prophet (ﷺ). He asked: Have you embraced Islam? I replied: No. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I have been prohibited to accept the present of polytheists.
3058 | Narrated Alqamah ibn Wa'il:      The Prophet (ﷺ) bestowed land in Hadramawt as fief.
3059 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by ‘Alqamah bin Wa’il through a different chain of narrators.”
3060 | Narrated Amr ibn Hurayth:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) demarcated a house with a bow at Medina for me. He said: I shall give you more. I shall give you more.
3061 | Narrated Rabi'ah ibn AbuAbdurRahman:      Rabi'ah reported on the authority of more than one person saying: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) assigned as a fief to Bilal ibn al-Harith al-Muzani the mines of al-Qabaliyyah which is in the neighbourhood of al-Fur', and only zakat is levied on those mines up to the present day.
3062 | Narrated Amr ibn Awf al-Muzani:      The Prophet (ﷺ) assigned as a fief to Bilal ibn al-Muzani the mines of al-Qabaliyyah both  which lay on the upper side and which lay on the lower side, and (the land) which was suitable for cultivation at Quds. He did not give him (the land which involved) the right of a Muslim. The Prophet (ﷺ) wrote a document for him. It goes: "In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) assigned to Bilal ibn Harith al-Muzani. He gave him the mines of al-Qabaliyyah, both which lay on the upper side and which lay on the lower side, and (the land) which is suitable for cultivation at Quds. He did not give him the right of any Muslim."    Abu Uwais said: A similar tradition has been narrated to me by Thawr b. Zaid, client of Banu al-Dail b. Bakr b. Kinahah from 'Ikrimah on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas.
3063 | Narrated Amr ibn Awf al-Muzani:      The Prophet (ﷺ) assigned as a fief to Bilal ibn Harith al-Muzani the mines of al-Qabaliyyah, both those which lay on the upper side those and which lay on the lower side. The narrator, Ibn an-Nadr, added: "also Jars and Dhat an-Nusub." The agreed version reads: "and (the land) which is suitable for cultivation at Quds". He did not assign to Bilal ibn al-Harith the right of any Muslim. The Prophet (ﷺ) wrote a document to him:        "This is what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) assigned to Bilal ibn al-Harith al-Muzani. He gave him the mines of al-Qabaliyyah both those which lay on the upper and lower side, and that which is fit for cultivation at Quds. He did not give him the right of any Muslim."        The narrator AbuUways said: A similar tradition has been transmitted to me by Thawr ibn Zayd from Ikrimah on the authority of Ibn Abbas from the Prophet (ﷺ). Ibn an-Nadr added: Ubayy ibn Ka'b wrote it.
3064 | Narrated Abyad ibn Hammal:      Abyad went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him for assigning him (the mines of) salt as fief. (The narrator Ibn al-Mutawakkil said: which was in Ma'arib.)       So he assigned it to him as a fief. When he returned, a man in the meeting asked: Do you know what you have assigned him as a fief? You have assigned him the perennial spring water. So he took it back from him. He asked him about protecting land which had arak trees growing in it. He replied: He could have such as was beyond the region where the hoofs (of camels) went.    The narrator Ibn al-Mutwakkil said: "that is the camel hoofs."
3065 | Muhammad bin Al hasan Al Mukhzumi said “The sentence “that which is not reached by the Camel hoofs” means that the Camels eat (the arak trees) within the reach of their heads. So the land (where the arak trees are growing) may be protected beyond such a region.
3066 | Narrated Abyad ibn Hammal:      He asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for giving him some land which had arak trees growing in it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is no (permission for) protecting a land which has arak trees growing in it. He said: These arak trees are within the boundaries of my field. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no (permission for) protecting a land which has arak trees growing in it.       The narrator Faraj said: By the phrase 'within the boundaries of my field' he meant the land which had crop growing in it and was surrounded on four sides.
3067 | Narrated Sakhr ibn al-Ayla al-Ahmasi:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raided Thaqif. When Sakhr heard this, he proceeded on his horse along with some horsemen to support the Prophet (ﷺ). He found the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) had returned and he did not conquer (Ta'if).       On that day Sakhr made a covenant with Allah and had His protection that he would not depart from that fortress until they (the inhabitants) surrendered to the command of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He did not leave them until they had surrendered to the command of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        Sakhr then wrote to him: To proceed: Thaqif have surrendered to your command, Messenger of Allah, and I am on my way to them. They have horses with them.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then ordered prayers to be offered in congregation. He then prayed for Ahmas ten times: O Allah, send blessings the horses and the men of Ahmas.        The people came and Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said to him: Prophet of Allah, Sakhr took my paternal aunt while she embraced Islam like other Muslims.        He called him and said: Sakhr, when people embrace Islam, they have security of their blood and property. Give back to Mughirah his paternal aunt.        So he returned his aunt to him and asked the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ): What about Banu Sulaym who have run away for (fear of) Islam and left that water? He said: Prophet of Allah, allow me and my people to settle there.        He said: Yes. So he allowed him to settle there. Banu Sulaym then embraced Islam, and they came to Sakhr. They asked him to return their water to them. But he refused.        So they came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Prophet of Allah, we embraced Islam and came to Sakhr so that he might return our water to us. But he has refused.        He (the Prophet) then came to him and said: When people embrace Islam, they secure their properties and blood. Return to the people their water.        He said: Yes, Prophet of Allah. I saw that the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was reddening at that moment, being ashamed of taking back from him the slave-girl and the water.
3068 | Narrated Saburah ibn Ma'bad al-Juhani:      The Prophet (ﷺ) alighted at a place where a mosque has been built under a large tree. He tarried there for three days, and then proceeded to Tabuk. Juhaynah met him on a wide plain. He asked them: who are the people of Dhul-Marwah? They replied: Banu Rifa'ah of Juhaynah. He said: I have given this (land) to Banu Rifa'ah as a fief. Therefore, they divided it. Some of them sold (their share) and others retained and worked on it.        (Sub-narrator Ibn Wahab said: I then asked AbdulAziz about this tradition. He narrated a part of it to me and did not narrate it in full.
3069 | Narrated Asma' daughter of AbuBakr:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) assigned to az-Zubayr palm-trees as a fief.
3070 | Narrated Qaylah bint Makhramah:      Abdullah ibn Hasan al-Anbari said: My grandmothers, Safiyyah and Duhaybah, narrated to me, that hey were the daughters of Ulaybah and were nourished by Qaylah, daughter of Makhramah. She was the grandmother of their father.       She reported to them, saying: We came upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). My companion, Hurayth ibn Hassan, came to him as a delegate from Bakr ibn Wa'il. He took the oath of allegiance of Islam for himself and for his people.       He then said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), write a document for us, giving us the land lying between us and Banu Tamim at ad-Dahna' to the effect that not one of them will cross it in our direction except a traveller or a passer-by.        He said: Write down ad-Dahna' for them, boy. When I saw that he passed orders to give it to him, I became anxious, for it was my native land and my home.        I said: Messenger of Allah, he did not ask you for a true border when he asked you. This land of Dahna' is a place where the camels have their home, and it is a pasture for the sheep. The women of Banu Tamim and their children are beyond it.        He said: Stop, boy! A poor woman spoke the truth: a Muslim is a brother of a Muslim. Each one of them may benefit from water and trees, and they should cooperate with each other against Satan.
3071 | Narrated Asmar ibn Mudarris:      I came to the Prophet (ﷺ), and took the oath of allegiance to him. He said: If anyone reaches a water which has not been approached before by any Muslim, it belongs to him. The people, therefore, went out running and marking (on the land).
3072 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Prophet (ﷺ) gave az-Zubayr the land as a fief up to the reach of his horse when he runs. He, therefore, made his horse run until it stopped. He then threw his flog. Thereupon he said: Give him (the land) up to the point where his flog has reached.
3073 | Narrated Sa'id ibn Zayd:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone brings barren land into cultivation, it belongs to him, and the unjust vein has no right.
3074 | Narrated Urwah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone brings barren land into cultivation,  it belong to him. He then transmitted a similar tradition mentioned above (No. 3067).    He ('Urwah) said: One who transmitted this tradition to me said that two persons brought their dispute to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). One of them grew palm trees in the land of the other. He decided to return the land to its owner of the palm-trees to remove his palm-trees. He said: I saw when their roots were being struck with axes. The trees were fully grown up, but they were removed from there.
3075 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Ibn Ishaq through a different chain of narrators and to the same effect. Instead of the phrase “one who transmitted this tradition to me” this version has “A man from among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and probably he was Abu Sa’id Al Khudri. I saw the man striking at the roots of the palm trees.”
3076 | Narrated Urwah:      I testify that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) decided that the land is the land of Allah, and the servants are the servants of Allah. If anyone brings barren land into cultivation, he has more right to it.        This tradition has been transmitted to us from the Prophet (ﷺ) by those who transmitted the traditions about prayer from him.
3077 | Narrated Samurah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone surrounds a land with a wall, it belongs to him.
3078 | Hisham said “The unjust vein means that a man implants a tree in the land of another man so that they may be entitled to it. Malik said “The unjust vein means that a man takes (a thing) digs a pit and implants a tree without (his) right.
3079 | Abu Humaid Al Sa’idi said “I went to Tabuk on an expedition along with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). When he reached Wadi Al Qura, he found a woman in her garden. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said to his Companions “Assess (the quantity o fruits). The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) assessed ten wasqs.” He said to the woman “Count the produce of it. We then came to Tabuk.” The monarch of Ailah presented a white mule as a gift to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). He presented a cloak as a gift o him and wrote a document for his land at sea coast. When we came to Wadi Al Qura he said to the woman “How much is the produce of your garden?” She replied “Ten wasqs which the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) had assessed.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “I am going quickly to Madeenah if any of you intend to go quickly with me , he should make haste.”
3080 | Narrated Zaynab:      She was picking lice from the head of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while the wife of Uthman ibn Affan and the immigrant women were with him.

3081 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      He who put the necklace of jizyah in his neck abandoned the way followed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
3082 | Narrated AbudDarda':      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone takes land by (paying) its jizyah, he renounces his immigration; and if anyone takes off the disgrace of an unbeliever from his neck he turns away his back from Islam. He (the narrator) said: Thereafter Khalid ibn Ma'dan heard this tradition from me, and he said: Has Shubayb narrated it to you? I said: Yes. He said! When you come to him, ask him to write this tradition to me. He said: He then wrote it for him. When I came, Khalid ibn Ma'dan asked me for the paper and I gave it to him. When he read (the paper), he abandoned the lands he had in his possession the moment he heard this.   Abu Dawud said: This Yazid b. Khumair al-Yazani is not the disciple of Shu'bah.
3083 | Al Sa’b bin Jaththamah reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “There is no (permission for) protected land except for Allaah and His Prophet.    Ibn Shihab said “It has reached me that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) protected Naqi’.”
3084 | Narrated As-Sa'b ibn Jaththamah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) protected Naqi and said: There is no (permission for) protected land except for Allah Most High.
3085 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A fifth is payable on buried treasure.
3086 | Al hasan said “Rikaz means treasure buried in pre Islamic times.”
3087 | Narrated Duba'ah daughter of az-Zubayr ibn AbdulMuttalib:      Al-Miqdad went to Baqi' al-Khabkhabah for a certain need. He found a mouse taking out a dinar from a hole. It then continued to take out dinars one by one until it took out seventeen dinars. It then took out a red purse containing a dinar. There were thus eighteen dinars. He took them to the Prophet (ﷺ), informed him and said to him: Take its sadaqah. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: Did you extend your hand toward the hole? He replied: No. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: May Allah bless you in it.
3088 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      When we went out along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to at-Ta'if we passed a grave. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: This is the grave of AbuRighal. He was in this sacred mosque (sanctuary) protecting himself (from punishment). When he came out, he suffered the same punishment which his people suffered at this place, and he was buried in it. The sign of it is that a golden bough was buried with him. If you dig it out, you will find it with him. The people hastened to it and took out the bough.
3089 | Narrated Amir ar-Ram:      We were in our country when flags and banners were raised. I said: What is this?        The (the people) said: This is the banner of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So I came to him. He was (sitting) under a tree. A sheet of cloth was spread for him and he was sitting on it. His Companions were gathered around him. I sat with them.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned illness and said: When a believer is afflicted by illness and Allah cures him of it, it serves as an atonement for his previous sins and a warning to him for the future.        But when a hypocrite becomes ill and is then cured, he is like a camel which has been tethered and then let loose by its owners, but does not know why they tethered it and why they let it loose.        A man from among those around him asked: Messenger of Allah, what are illnesses? I swear by Allah, I never fell ill.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Get up and leave us. You do not belong to our number. When we were with him, a man came to him. He had a sheet of cloth and something in his hand.        He turned his attention to him and said: Messenger of Allah, when I saw you, I turned towards you. I saw a group of trees and heard the sound of fledglings. I took them and put them in my garment. Their mother then came and began to hover round my head. I showed them to her, and she fell on them. I wrapped them with my garment. They are now with me.        He said: Put them away from you. So I put them away, but their mother stayed with them.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to his companions: Are you surprised at the affection of the mother for her young?        They said: Yes, Messenger of Allah.  He said: I swear by Him Who has sent me with the Truth, Allah is more affectionate to His servants than a mother to her young ones. Take them back put them and where you took them from when their mother should have been with them. So he took them back.
3090 | Narrated Muhammad ibn Khalid as-Sulami:      on his father's authority said his grandfather reported: He was a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: When Allah has previously decreed for a servant a rank which he has not attained by his action, He afflicts him in his body, or his property or his children.    Abu Dawud said: Ibn Nufail added in his version: "He then enables him to endure that." The agreed version goes: "So that He may bring him to the rank previously decreed from him by Allah."
3091 | Narrated Abu Musa:I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) many times say: When a servant of Allah is accustomed to do a good work, then becomes ill or goes on journey, what was accustomed to do when he was well and staying at home will be recorded for him.
3092 | Narrated Umm al-Ala:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) visited me while I was sick. He said: Be glad, Umm al-Ala' for Allah removes the sins of a Muslim for his illness as fire removes the dross of gold and silver.
3093 | Narrated 'Aishah: I said: Messenger of Allah, I know the severest verse in the Qur'an. He asked: What is that verse. A'ishah? She replied: Allah's words: "If anyone does evil, he will be requited for it." He said: Do you know A'ishah, that when a believer is afflicted with a calamity or a thorn, it serves as an atonement for his evil deed. He who is called to account will be punished. She said: Does Allah not say: "He truly will recieve an easy reckoning." He said: This is the presentation, A'ishah. If anyone criticized in reckoning, he will be punished.   Abu Dawud said: This is the version of Ibn Bashshar. He said: Ibn Abi Mulaikah narrated to us.
3094 | Narrated Usamah b. Zaid:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to visit 'Abd Allah b. Ubayy during his illness of which he died. When he entered upon him, he realised death on him. He said: I used to forbid you from the love of Jews. He ('Abd Allah) said: As'ad b. Zurarah hated them. So what (the benefited) ? When he died, his son came and said: Prophet of Allah, 'Abd Allah b. Ubayy has died, give me your shirt, so that I shroud him in it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took off his shirt and gave it to him.
3095 | Narrated Anas :A young Jew became ill. The Prophet (ﷺ) went to visit him. He sat down by his head and said to him: Accept Islam.

3192 | Narrated 'Uqbah bin 'Amir:There were three times at which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to forbid us to pray or bury our dead - when the sun begins to rise till it is fully up, when the sun is at its height midway till it passes the meridian, and when the sun draws near to setting till it sets, or as he said.
3193 | Yahya ibn Subayh said:Ammar client of al-Harith ibn Nawfal told me that he attended the funeral of Umm Kulthum, and her son. The body of the boy was placed near the imam. I objected to it. Among the people there were Ibn Abbas, AbuSa'id al-Khudri, AbuQatadah and AbuHurayrah. They said: This is the sunnah (established practice of the Prophet).
3194 | Nafi' AbuGhalib said:I was in the Sikkat al-Mirbad. A bier passed and a large number of people were accompanying it.        They said: Bier of Abdullah ibn Umayr. So I followed it. Suddenly I saw a man, who had a thin garment on riding his small mule. He had a piece of cloth on his head to protect himself from the sun.  I asked: Who is this important man? People said: This is Anas ibn Malik.       When the bier was placed, Anas stood and led the funeral prayer over him while I was just behind him, and there was no obstruction between me and him. He stood near his head, and uttered four takbirs (Allah is Most Great). He neither lengthened the prayer nor hurried it. He then went to sit down. They said: AbuHamzah, (here is the bier of) an Ansari woman. They brought her near him and there was a green cupola-shaped structure over her bier. He stood opposite her hips and led the funeral prayer over her as he had led it over the man. He then sat down.        Al-Ala' ibn Ziyad asked: AbuHamzah, did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say the funeral prayer over the dead as you have done, uttering four takbirs (Allah is Most Great) over her, and standing opposite the head of a man and the hips of a woman?        He replied: Yes.  He asked: AbuHamzah, did you fight with the Messenger of Allah?  He replied: Yes. I fought with him in the battle of Hunayn. The polytheists came out and invaded us so severely that we saw our horses behind our backs. Among the people (i.e. the unbelievers) there was a man who was attacking us, and striking and wounding us (with his sword). Allah then defeated them. They were then brought and began to take the oath of allegiance to him for Islam.        A man from among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said: I make a vow to myself that if Allah brings the man who was striking us (with his sword) that day, I shall behead him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kept silent and the man was brought (as a captive).        When he saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he said: Messenger of Allah, I have repented to Allah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stopped (for a while) receiving his oath of allegiance, so that the other man might fulfil his vow. But the man began to wait for the order of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for his murder. He was afraid of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to kill him. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that he did not do anything, he received his oath of allegiance.  The man said: Messenger of Allah, what about my vow?  He said: I stopped (receiving his oath of allegiance) today so that you might fulfil your vow.  He said: Messenger of Allah, why did you not give any signal to me?  The Prophet (ﷺ) said: It is not worthy of a Prophet to give a signal.        AbuGhalib said: I asked (the people) about Anas standing opposite the hips of a woman. They told me that this practice was due to the fact that (in the days of the Prophet) there were no cupola-shaped structures over the biers of women. So the imam used to stand opposite the hips of a woman to hide her from the people.   Abu Dawud said: The saying of the Prophet (ﷺ) "I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say: There is no god bu Allah" abrogated this tradition of fulfilling the vow by his remark: "I have repented".

3200 | Ali ibn Shammakh said:I was present with Marwan who asked AbuHurayrah: Did you hear how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray over the dead? He said: Even with the words that you said. (The narrator said: They exchanged hot words between them before that.)       Abu Hurairah said: O Allah, Thou art its Lord. Thou didst create it, Thou didst guide it to Islam, Thou hast taken its spirit, and Thou knowest best its inner nature and outer aspect. We have come as intercessors, so forgive him.   Abu Dawud said: Shu'bah made a mistake in mentioning the name of 'Ali b. Shammakh. He said in his version: 'Uthman b. Shammas.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad b. Ibrahim al-Mawsili say that Ahmad b. Hanbal said: In every meeting which I attended with Hammad b. Zaid he forbade to narrate this traditions from 'Abd al-Warith and Ja'far b. Sulaiman.
3201 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed over a dead person, he said: O Allah, forgive those of us who are living and those of us who are dead, those of us who are present and those of us who are absent, our young and our old, our male and our female. O Allah, to whomsoever of us Thou givest life grant him life as a believer, and whomsoever of us Thou takest in death take him in death as a follower of Islam. O Allah, do not withhold from us the reward (of faith) and do not lead us astray after his death.

(AbdurRahman in his version said: "In Thy protection and in Thy nearer presence, so guard him from the trial in the grave) and the punishment in Hell. Thou art faithful and worthy of praise. O Allah, forgive him and show him mercy. Thou art the forgiving and the merciful one." AbdurRahman said: "On the authority of Marwan ibn Janah."
3203 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:A negress (or a youth) used to sweep the mosque. The Prophet (ﷺ) missed him, and when he asked about him the people told him that he had died. He said: Why have you not informed me ? He said: Lead me to his grave. So they led him and he prayed over him.

It I were not in the land which I am, I would come to him and carry his shoes.
3206 | Narrated Al-Muttalib:      When Uthman ibn Maz'un died, he was brought out on his bier and buried. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered a man to bring him a stone, but he was unable to carry it.

The narrator Kathir told that al-Muttalib remarked: The one who told me about the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I still seem to see the whiteness of the forearms of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he rolled up his sleeves. He then carried it and placed it at his head saying: I am marking my brother's grave with it, and I shall bury beside him those of my family who die.

3212 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to the funeral of a man of the Ansar, but when we reached the grave, the niche in the side had not yet been made, so the Prophet (ﷺ) sat down facing the qiblah, and we sat down along with him.

Umar said to him: The Ka'bah does not need your property. Make atonement for your oath and speak to your brother. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: An oath or vow to disobey the Lord, or to break ties of relationship or about something over which one has no control is not binding on you.
3273 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: A vow is binding in those things by which the pleasure of Allah is sought, and an oath to break ties of relationship is not binding.
3274 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: An oath or a vow about something over which a human being has no control, and to disobey Allah, and to break ties of relationship is not binding. If anyone takes an oath and then considers something else better than it, he should give it up, and do what is better, for leaving it is its atonement.   Abu Dawud said: All sound traditions from the Prophet (ﷺ) say: "He should make atonement for his oath," except those versions which are not reliable.   Abu Dawud said: I said to Ahmad: Yahya b. Sa'id (al-Qattan) has transmitted this tradition from Yahya b. 'Ubaid Allah. He (Ahmad b. Hanbal) said: But he gave it up after that, and he was competent for doing it. Ahmad said: His (Yahya b. 'Ubaid Allah's) tradition are munkar (rejected) and his father is not known.
3275 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Two men brought their dispute to the Prophet (ﷺ). The Prophet (ﷺ) asked the plaintiff to produce evidence, but he had no evidence. So he asked the defendant to swear. He swore by Allah "There is no god but He."       The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Yes, you have done it, but you have been forgiven for the sincerity of the statement: "There is no god but Allah."   Abu Dawud said: This tradition means that he did not command him to make atonement
3276 | Narrated Abu Burdah:On the authority of his father that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: I swear by Allah that if Allah wills I shall swear on an oath and then consider something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing the thing that is better. Or he said (according to another version): But doing the thing that is better and making atonement for my oath.
3277 | Narrated 'Abd al-Rahman b. Samurah: The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me: 'Abd al-Rahman b. Samurah, when you swear an oath and consider something else to be better than it, do the thing that is beter and make atonement for your oath.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad (b. Hanbal) permitting to make atonement before breaking the oath.
3278 | A similar tradition has been transmitted by 'Abd al-Rahman b. Samurah through a different chain if narrators. This version has:"Make atonement for your oath and then do the thing that is better."    Abu Dawud said: The version of this tradition transmitted by Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, 'Adi b. Hatim and Abu Hurairah are variant. Some of them indicate breaking the oath before making atonement, and other making atonement before breaking the oath.
3279 | Narrated Safiyyah bint Huyayy:      Ibn Harmalah said: Umm Habib gave us a sa' and told us narration from the nephew of Safiyyah on the authority of Safiyyah that it was the sa' of the Prophet (ﷺ).       Anas ibn Ayyad said: I tested it and found its capacity two and half mudd according to the mudd of Hisham.
3280 | Narrated Muhammad b. Muhmmad b. Khattab Abu 'Umar :We had a makkuk which was called Makkuk Khalid. Its capacity was two measurements according to the measurements of Harun. The narrator said: The sa' of Khalid was the sa' of Hisham b. 'Abd al-Malik.
3281 | Narrated Umayyah b. Khalid: When Khalid al-Qasri was made ruler (of Hijaz and Kufah), he doubled the measure of sa'. The sa' then measured sixteen rotls.   Abu Dawud said: Muhammad b. Muhammad b. Khattab was slain by Negroes in confinement. He said while signing with his hand: "in this way". Abu Dawud extended his hand and turned his palms towards earth and said: I saw him in the dream and asked him: How did Allah deal with you ? He replied: He admitted to Paradise. I said: Your detention did not harm you.
3282 | Narrated Mu'awiyah b. al-Hakam al-Sulami:I said: Messenger of Allah, I have a slave girl whom I slapped. This grieved the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I said to him: Should I not emancipate her? He said: Bring her to me. He said: Then I brought her. He asked: Where is Allah ? She replied: In the heaven. He said: Who am I ? She replied: You are the Messenger of Allah. He said: Emancipate her, she is a believer.
3283 | Narrated Ash-Sharid ibn Suwayd ath-Thaqafi:      Sharid's mother left a will to emancipate a believing slave on her behalf. So he came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, my mother left a will that I should emancipate a believing slave for her, and I have a black Nubian slave-girl. He mentioned a tradition about the test of the girl.    Abu Dawud said: Khalid b. 'Abd Allah narrated this tradition direct from the Prophet (ﷺ). He did not mention the name of al-Sharid.
3284 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:A man brought the Prophet (ﷺ) a black slave girl. He said: Messenger of Allah, emancipation of believing slave is due to me. He asked her: Where is Allah ? She pointed to the heaven with her finger. He then asked her: Who am I ? She pointed to the Prophet (ﷺ) and to the heaven, that is to say: You are the Messenger of Allah. He then said: Set her free, she is a believer.
3285 | Narrated Ikrimah ibn AbuJahl:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I swear by Allah, I shall fight against the Quraysh; I swear by Allah, I shall fight against the Quraysh; I swear by Allah, I shall fight against the Quraysh. He then said: "If Allah wills."   Abu Dawud said: A number of persons have narrated this tradition from Sharik, from Simak, from 'Ikrimah, from Ibn 'Abbas who reported from the Prophet (ﷺ): "But he did not fight against them."
3286 | Narrated 'Ikrimah: The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: I swear by Allah,  I shall fight against the Quraish. The then said: If Allah wills. He again said: I swear by Allah, I shall fight against the Quraish if Allah wills. He again said: I swear by Allah, I shall fight against the Quraish. He then kept silence. Then he said: If Allah wills.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Walid b. Muslim said on the authority of Sharik: He then said: But he did not fight against them.
3287 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade to make a vow. He said: It has not effect against fate, it is only from the miserly that it is means by which something is extracted.   Musaddad said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: A vow does not avert anything (i.e. has no effect against fate).
3288 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: A vow does not provide for the son of Adam anything which I did not decree for him, but a vow draws it. A Divine decree is one which I have destined, it is extracted from a miser. He is given what he was not given before.
3289 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: If anyone vows to obey Allah, let him obey Him, but if anyone vows to disobey Him, let him not disobey Him.
3290 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: No vow must be taken to do an act of disobedience, and the atonement for it is the same as for an oath.
3291 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by al-Zuhri through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.   Abu Dawud said:I heard Ahmad b. Shabbuyah say: Ibn al-Mubarak said about this tradition that Abu Salamah had transmitted it. This indicates that al-Zuhri did not hear it from Abu Salamah. Ahmad b. Muhammad said: This is verified by what Ayyub b. Sulaiman narrated to us.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: I have corrupted this tradition for us. He was asked: Do you think that it is correct that this tradition has been corrupted? Has any person other than Ibn Abi Uwais transmitted it ? He replied: Ayyub was similar to him in respect of reliability, and Ayyub transmitted it.
3292 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: No vow must be taken to do an act of disobedience, and the atonement for it is the same as for an oath.   Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Marwazi said: The correct chain of this tradition is: 'Ali b. al-Mubarak, from Yahya b. Abi Kathir, from Muhammad b. al-Zubair, from his father, on the authority of 'Imran b. Husain from the Prophet (ﷺ)   Abu Dawud said: By this he (al-Marwazi) means that the narrator Sulaiman b. Arqam had some misunderstanding about this tradition. Al-Zuhri narrated it from him and then transmitted it (omitting his name) from Abu Salamah on the authority of 'Aishah.   Abu Dawud said: Baqiyyah has transmitted it from al-Auza'i from Yahya, from Muhammad b. al-Zubair with a similar chain of Ibn al-Mubarak.
3293 | Narrated Uqbah ibn Amir:      Uqbah consulted the Prophet (ﷺ) about his sister who took a vow to perform hajj barefooted and bareheaded. So he said: Command her to cover her head and to ride, and to fast three days.
3294 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Abu Sa'id al-Ru'aini with the same chain as narrated by Yahya (b. Sa'id) and to the same effect.
3295 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A man came to Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, my sister has taken a vow to perform hajj on foot. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Allah gets no good from the affliction your sister imposed on herself, so let her perform hajj riding and make atonement for her oath.
3296 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:That the sister of 'Uqbah b. 'Amir took vow to walk on foot to the Ka'bah. Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered her to ride and slaughter a sacrificial animal.
3297 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: That when the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed that the sister of 'Uqbah b. 'Amir had taken a vow to perform Hajj on foot, he said: Allah is not in need of her vow. So ask her to ride.   Abu Dawud said: Sa'ib b. 'Arubah has transmitted a similar tradition. Khalid has also transmitted a similar tradition on the authority of 'Ikrimah from the Prophet (ﷺ).
3298 | Narrated 'Ikrimah: The tradition about the sister of 'Uqbah b. 'Amir as narrated by Hisham, but he made no mention of the sacrificial animal. In his version he said: Ask your sister to ride.   Abu Dawud said: Khalid narrated it from 'Ikrimah to the same effect as narrated by Hisham.
3299 | Narrated 'Uqbah bin 'Amir al-Juhani:My sister took a vow to walk on foot to the House of Allah (i.e. Ka'bah). She asked me to consult the Prophet (ﷺ) about her. So I consulted the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: Let her walk and ride.
3300 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:While the Prophet (ﷺ) was preaching a man was standing in the sun. He asked about him. They said: He is Abu Isra'il who has taken a vow to stand and not to sit, or go into shade, or speak, but to fast. Thereupon he said: Command him to speak, to go into the shade, sit and complete his fast.
3301 | Narrated Anas b. Malik : The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw a man that he was supported between his sons. He asked about him, and (the people) said: He has taken a vow to walk (on foot). Thereupon he said: Allah has no need that this man should punish himself, and he ordered him to ride.   Abu Dawud said: 'Amr b. Abi 'Amir has also narrated a similar tradition from al-A'raj on the authority of Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ).

3304 | Narrated Uqbah ibn Amir al-Juhani:      Uqbah said to the Prophet (ﷺ): My sister has taken a vow that she will walk to the House of Allah (the Ka'bah). Thereupon he said: Allah will not do anything of the walking of your sister to the House of Allah (i.e. the Ka'bah).
3305 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:     A man stood on the day of Conquest (of Mecca) and said: Messenger of Allah, I have vowed to Allah that if He grants conquest of Mecca at your hands, I shall pray two rak'ahs in Jerusalem.  He replied: Pray here. He repeated (his statement) to him and he said: Pray here. He again repeated (his statement) to him. He (the Prophet) replied: Pursue your own course, then.   Abu Dawud said: A similar tradition has been narrated by 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf from the Prophet (ﷺ).
3306 | The tradition mentioned above (No.3299) has also been transmitted by Umar ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf on the authority of his father and the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ).       This version has:"The Prophet (ﷺ) said: By Him Who sent Muhammad with truth, if you prayed here, this would be sufficient for you like the prayer in Jerusalem."   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by al-Ansari, from Ibn-Juraij. He said: Ja'far b. 'Umar and 'Amr b. Hayyah. He said: They transmitted from 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf and from the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ).
3307 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:Sa'd b. 'Ubadah asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): My Mother has died and she could not fulfill her vow which she had taken. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Fulfill it on her behalf.
3308 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A woman made a voyage and vowed that she would fast one month if Allah made her reach her destination with peace and security. Allah made her reach her destination with security but she died before she could fast. Her daughter or sister (the narrator doubted) came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So he commanded to fast on her behalf.
3309 | Narrated Buraidah:A woman came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I gave a slave girl to my mother, but she died and left the salve-girl. He said: Your reward became certain for you, and she (the slave-girl) returned to you as inheritance. She said: She died and one month's fast was due from her. He (the narrator) then mentioned the tradition similar to the one mentioned by 'Amr b. 'Awn.
3310 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:A woman came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said (to him) that one month's fast was due from her mother who had died. May I fulfill them on her behalf? He asked: Suppose some debt was due from your mother, would you pay it ? She replied: Yes. He said: So the debt due to Allah is the one which most deserves to be paid.
3311 | Narrated 'Aishah:The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: If anyone dies when some fast due from him has been unfulfilled, his heir must fast on his behalf.
3312 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather said: A woman came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, I have taken a vow to play the tambourine over you.       He said: Fulfil your vow.       She said: And I have taken a vow to perform a sacrifice in such a such a place, a place in which people had performed sacrifices  in pre-Islamic times.       He asked: For an Idol?       She replied: No.       He asked: For an image?       She replied: No.       He said: Fulfil your vow.
3313 | Narrated Thabit ibn ad-Dahhak:      In the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) a man took a vow to slaughter a camel at Buwanah. So he came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I have taken a vow to sacrifice a camel at Buwanah.       The Prophet (ﷺ) asked: Did the place contain any idol worshipped in pre-Islamic times?       They (the people) said: No.       He asked: Was any pre-Islamic festival observed there?       They replied: No.       The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Fulfil your vow, for a vow to do an act of disobedience to Allah must not be fulfilled, neither must one do something over which a human being has no control.
3314 | Narrated Maymunah, daughter of Kardam:      I went out with my father to see the hajj performed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I fixed my eyes on him. My father came near him while he was riding his she-camel. He had a whip like the whip of scribes. I heard the bedouin and the people say: The whip, the whip. My father came near him and held his foot. She said: He admitted his Prophethood and stood and listened to him.        He said: Messenger of Allah, I have made a vow that if a son is born to me, I shall slaughter a number of sheep at the end of Buwanah in the dale of hill.        The narrator said: I do not know (for certain) that she said: Fifty (sheep).        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Does it contain any idol?        He said: No. Then he said: Fulfil your vow that you have taken for Allah. He then gathered them (i.e. the sheep) and began to slaughter them. A sheep ran away from them.        He searched for it saying: O Allah, fulfil my vow on my behalf. So he succeeded (in finding it) and slaughtered it.
3315 | A similar tradition has also been transmitted in brief by Maimunah daughter of Kardam son of Sufyan on the authority of her father through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:(The Prophet asked): Does it contain an idol or was a festival of pre-Islamic times celebrated there ? He replied: No. I said: This mother of mine has taken a vow and walking (is binding on her). May I fulfill it on her behalf ? Sometimes the narrator Bashshar said: May we fulfill in on her behalf ? He said: Yes.
3316 | 'Imran b. Husain said:'Adba belonged to a man of Banu 'Aqil. It used to go ahead of pligrims. The man was then captivated. He was brought in chains to the Prophet (ﷺ). The Prophet (ﷺ) was riding on a donkey with a blanket on him. He said: Muhammad, why do you arrest me and capture the one (i.e. the she-camel) which goes ahead of the pilgrims. He replied: We are arresting you on account of the crime committed by your allies Thaqid. Thaqif captivated two persons from among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ). He said (whatever he said) I am a Muslim, or he said: I have embraced Islam. When the Prophet (ﷺ) went ahead, he called him: O Muhammed, O Muhammed. Abu Dawud said: I learnt it from the version of the narrator Muhammad b. 'Isa. The Prophet (ﷺ) was compassionate and kind hearted. So he returned to him, and asked: What is the matter with you ? He replied: I am a Muslim. He said: Had you said it when the matter was in your hand, you would have succeeded completely. Abu Dawud said: I then returned to the version of the narrator Sulaiman (b. Harb). He said: Muhammad, I am hungry, so feed me. I am thirsty, so give me water. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: This is your need, or he said: This is his need (the narrator is doubtful). Later on the man was taken back (by Thaqif) as a ransom for the two men (of the Companions of the Prophet). The Prophet (ﷺ) retained 'Adba for his journey. The narrator said: The polytheists raided the pasturing animals of Medina and they took away 'Adba. When they took away 'Adba, they also captivated a Muslim woman. They used to leave their camels in the fields for rest at night. One night they slept and the (Muslim) woman stood up. Any camel on which she put her hand brayed until she came to 'Adba. She came to a she-camel which was docile and experienced. She then rode on her and vowed to Allah that if He saved her, she would sacrifice it. When she came to Medina, the people recognized the she-camel of the Prophet (ﷺ). The Prophet (ﷺ) was then informed about it and he sent for her. She was brought to him and she informed him about her vow. He said: It is a bad return that you have given it. Allah has not saved you, on its (back) that you now sacrifice it. A vow to do an act of disobedience must not be fulfilled, or to do something over which one has no control.   Abu Dawud said: This woman was the wife of Abu Dharr.
3317 | Narrated Ka'b ibn Malik:      I said: Messenger of Allah, to make my repentance complete I should divest myself of my property as sadaqah (alms) for Allah and His Apostle. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Retain some of your property, for that will be better for you. So he said: I shall retain the portion I have at Khaybar.
3318 | Narrated Ka'b bin Malik:To the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when his repentance was accepted: I should divest myself of my property. He then mentioned a similar tradition up to the words, "better for you".
3319 | Narrated Ka'b ibn Malik:      Ka'b ibn Malik said to AbuLubabah; or someone else whom Allah wished; or to the Prophet (ﷺ): To make my repentance complete I should depart from the house of my people in which I fell into sin, and that I should divest myself of all my property as sadaqah (alms). He said: A third (of your property) will be sufficient for you.
3320 | This tradition has also been transmitted by Ibn Ka'b b. Malik through a different chain of narrators. This version has:"He then mentioned the tradition to the same effect. This versions attributes this story to Abu Lubabah."   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Yunus from Ibn Shihab from some of the children of al-Sa'ib son of Abu Lubabah. A similar tradition has also been transmitted by al-Zabidi from al-Zuhri from Husain b. al-Sa'ib son of Abu Lubabah.
3321 | Narrated Ka'b ibn Malik:      I said: Messenger of Allah, to make my atonement complete I should divest myself of my all property as sadaqah (alms) for Allah and His apostle. He said: No. I said: The half of it. He said: No. I said: Then a third of it. He said: Yes. I said: I shall retain the portion I have at Khaybar.
3322 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone takes a vow but does not name it, its atonement is the same as that for an oath, if anyone takes a vow to do an act of disobedience, its atonement is the same as that for an oath, if anyone takes a vow he is unable to fulfill, its atonement is the same as that for an oath, but if anyone takes a vow he is able to fulfill, he must do so.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Waki' and others on the authority of 'Abd Allah b. Sa'id b. Abi al-Hind, but they traced it no farther back than Ibn 'Abbas.
3323 | Narrated 'Uqbah bin 'Amir: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: The atonement for a vow is the same as for an oath.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by 'Amr b. al-Harith from Ka'b b. 'Alqamah, from Ibn Shamasah on the authority of 'Uqbah.
3324 | A similar tradition has also been transmitted by 'Uqbah b. 'Amir from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators.
3325 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar:That 'Umar said: Messenger of Allah, I took a vow in pre-Islamic times that I would stay in the sacred mosque (Masjid Haram) as a devotion (i'tikaf). The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Fulfill your vow.
3326 | Narrated Qays ibn AbuGharazah:      In the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) we used to be called brokers, but the Prophet (ﷺ) came upon us one day, and called us by a better name than that, saying: O company of merchants, unprofitable speech and swearing takes place in business dealings, so mix it with sadaqah (alms).
3327 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Qais b. Abi Gharazah through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version has:"Lying and swearing have a place on i." 'Abd Allah al-Zuhri said: "Unprofitable speech and lying."
3328 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A man seized his debtor who owed ten dinars to him. He said to him: I swear by Allah, I shall not leave you until you pay off (my debt) to me or bring a surety. The Prophet (ﷺ) stood as a surety for him.       He then brought as much (money) as he promised. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked: From where did you acquire this gold? He replied: From a mine. He said: We have no need of it; there is no good in it. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) paid (the debt) on his behalf.
3329 | Narrated Al-Nu'man b. Bashir:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: What is lawful is clear and what is unlawful is clear, but between them are certain doubtful things. I give you an example for this. Allah has a preserve, and Allah's preserve is the things He has declared unlawful. He who pastures (his animals) round the preserve will soon fall into it. He who falls into doubtful things will soon be courageous.
3330 | Narrated Al-Nu'man b. Bashir:I heard Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: But between them are certain doubtful things which many people do not recognize. He who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and his honor blameless, but he who falls into doubtful things falls into what is unlawful.
3331 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A time is certainly coming to mankind when only the receiver of usury will remain, and if he does not receive it, some of its vapour will reach him. Ibn Isa said: Some of its dust will reach him.
3332 | Asim ibn Kulayb quoted his father's authority for the following statement by one of the Ansar:We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to a funeral, and I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the grave giving this instruction to the grave-digger:        Make it wide on the side of his feet, and make it wide on the side of his head. When he came back, he was received by a man who conveyed an invitation from a woman. So he came (to her), to it food was brought, and he put his hand (i.e. took a morsel in his hand); the people did the same and they ate. Our fathers noticed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was moving a morsel around his mouth.        He then said: I find the flesh of a sheep which has been taken without its owner's permission.        The woman sent a message to say: Messenger of Allah, I sent (someone) to an-Naqi' to have a sheep bought for me, but there was none; so I sent (a message) to my neighbour who had bought a sheep, asking him to send it to me for the price (he had paid), but he could not be found. I, therefore, sent (a message) to his wife and she sent it to me.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Give this food to the prisoners.
3333 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) cursed the one who accepted usury, the one who paid it, the witness to it, and the one who recorded it.
3334 | Narrated Sulaiman b. 'Amr:      On the authority of his father: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say in the Farewell Pilgrimage: "Lo, all claims to usury of the pre-Islamic period have been abolished. You shall have your capital sums, deal not unjustly and you shall not be dealt with unjustly.       Lo, all claims for blood-vengeance belonging to the pre-Islamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood-vengeance I remit is al-Harith ibn AbdulMuttalib, who suckled among Banu Layth and killed by Hudhayl."       He then said: O Allah, have I conveyed the message? They said: Yes, saying it three times. He then said: O Allah, be witness, saying it three times.
3335 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:I heard Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Swearing produces a ready sale for a commodity but blots out the blessing. The narrator Ibn al-Sarh said: "for earning". He also narrated this tradition from Sa'id b. al-Musayyab on the authority of Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ).
3336 | Narrated Suwayd ibn Qays:      I and Makhrafah al-Abdi imported some garments from Hajar, and brought them to Mecca. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us walking, and after he had bargained with us for some trousers, we sold them to him. There was a man who was weighing for payment. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: Weigh out and give overweight.
3337 | The tradition mentioned above (No. 3330) has also been transmitted by AbuSafwan ibn Umayrah through a different chain of narrators.       This version has:Abu Safwan said: I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at Mecca before his immigration. He then narrated the rest of the tradition, but he did not mention the words "who was weighing for payment".    Abu Dawud sad: Qais also transmitted it as Sufyan said: The version of Sufyan is authoritative.
3338 | Narrated Ibn Abi Rizmah:I heard my father say: A man said to Shu'bah: Sufyan opposed you (i.e. narrated a tradition which differs from your version). He replied: You racked my mind. I have been told that Yahya b. Ma'in said: If anyone opposes Sufyan, the version of Sufyan will be acceptable.
3339 | Shu'bah said:The memory of Sufyan was stronger than mine.
3340 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: (The standard) weight is the weight of the people of Mecca, and the (standard) measure is the measure of the people of Medina.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Firyabi and Abu Ahmad have also transmitted from Sufyan in a similar way, and he (Ibn Dukain) agreed with them on the text. The version of Abu Ahmad has: "from Ibn 'Abbas" instead of Ibn 'Umar. It has also been transmitted by al-Walid b. Muslim from Hanzalah. This version has: "the weight of Medina and the measure of Mecca."   Abu Dawud said: There is a variation in the text of the version of this tradition narrated by Malik b. Dinar from 'Ata' from the Prophet (ﷺ).
3341 | Narrated Samurah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us and said: Is here any one of such and such tribe present? But no one replied.       He again asked: Is here any one of such and such tribe present? But no one replied.       He again asked: Is here any one of such and such tribe?       Then a man stood and said: I am (here), Messenger of Allah.       He said: What prevented you from replying the first two times? I wish to tell you something good.       Your companion has been detained (from entering Paradise) on account of his debt. Then I saw him that he paid off all his debt on his behalf and there remained no one to demand from him anything.   Abu Dawud said: The name of the narrator Sam'an is Sam'an b. Mushannaj.
3342 | Narrated AbuMusa al-Ash'ari:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: After the grave sins which Allah has prohibited the greatest sin is that a man dies while he has debt due from him and does not leave anything to pay it off, and meets Him with it.
3343 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would not say funeral prayer over a person who died while the debt was due from him. A dead Muslim was brought to him and he asked: Is there any debt due from him? They (the people)  said: Yes, two dirhams. He said: Pray yourselves over your companion.       Then AbuQatadah al-Ansari said: I shall pay them, Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then prayed over him.       When Allah granted conquests to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he said: I am nearer to every believer than himself, so if anyone (dies and) leaves a debt, I shall be responsible for paying it; and if anyone leaves property, it goes to his heirs.
3344 | A similar tradition has also been transmitted by Ibn 'Abbas though a different chain of narrators. This version says:"He (the Prophet) purchased a calf from a caravan, but he had no money with him. He then sold it with some profit and gave the profit in charity to the poor and widows of Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib. He then said: I shall not buy anything after this but only when I have money with me.
3345 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Delay in payment (of debt) by a rich man is injunctive, but when one of you is referred to a wealthy man, he should accept the reference.
3346 | Narrated Abu Rafi':The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) borrowed a young camel, and when the camels of the sadaqah (alms) came to him, he ordered me to pay the man his young camel. I said: I find only an excellent camel in its seventh year. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Give it to him, for the best person is he who discharges his debt in the best manner.
3347 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) owed me a debt and gave me something extra when he paid it.
3348 | Narrated 'Umar:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Gold for gold is interest unless both hand over on the spot ; wheat for wheat is interest unless both hand over on the spot ; dates for dates is interest unless both hand over on the spot ; barley for barley is interest unless both hand over on the spot.
3349 | Narrated Ubadah ibn as-Samit:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Gold is to be paid for with gold, raw and coined, silver with silver, raw and coined (in equal weight), wheat with wheat in equal measure, barley with barley in equal measure, dates with dates in equal measure, salt by salt with equal measure; if anyone gives more or asks more, he has dealt in usury. But there is no harm in selling gold for silver and silver (for gold), in unequal weight, payment being made on the spot. Do not sell them if they are to be paid for later. There is no harm in selling wheat for barley and barley (for wheat) in unequal measure, payment being made on the spot. If the payment is to be made later, then do not sell them.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by Sa'id b. Abi 'Arubah, Hisham al-Dastawa'i and Qatadah from Muslim b. Yasar through his chain.
3350 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by 'Ubadah b. al-Samit through a different chain of transmitters with some alternation. This version adds:"He said: If these classes differ, sell as you wish if payment is made on the spot."
3351 | Narrated Fudalah ibn Ubayd:      The Prophet (ﷺ) was brought a necklace in which there were gold and pearls.       (The narrators AbuBakr and (Ahmad) Ibn Mani' said: The pearls were set with gold in it, and a man bought it for nine or seven dinars.)       The Prophet (ﷺ) said: (It must not be sold) till the contents are considered separately. The narrator said: He returned it till the contents were considered separately. The narrator Ibn Asa said: By this I intended trade.    Abu Dawud said: The word hijarah (stone) was recorded in his note-book before, but he changed it and narrated tijarah (trade).
3352 | Narrated Fudalah bin 'Ubaid:At the battle of Khaibar I bought a necklace in which there were gold and pearls for twelve dinars. I separated them and found that its worth was more than twelve dinars. So I mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ) who said: It must not be sold till the contents are considered separately.
3353 | Narrated Fudalah bin 'Ubaid:We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the battle of Khaibar. We were selling to the Jews one uqiyah of gold for one dinar. The narrators other than Qutaibah said: "for two or three dinars." Then both the versions agreed. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do not sell gold except with equal weight.
3354 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      I used to sell camels at al-Baqi for dinars and take dirhams for them, and sell for dirhams and take dinars for them. I would take these for these and give these for these. I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who was in the house of Hafsah. I said: Messenger of Allah , take it easy, I shall ask you (a question): I sell camels at al-Baqi'. I sell (them) for dinars and take dirhams and I sell for dirhams and take dinars. I take these for these, and give these for these. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: There is no harm in taking them at the current rate so long as you do not separate leaving something to be settled.
3355 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Simak (b. Harb) with a different chain of narrators and to the same effect. The first version is more perfect. It does not mention the words "at the current rate".
3356 | Narrated Samurah (ibn Jundub):      The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade selling animals for animals when payment was to be made at a later date.
3357 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded him to equip an army, but the camels were insufficient. So he commanded him to keep back the young camels of sadaqah, and he was taking a camel to be replaced by two when the camels of sadaqah came.
3358 | Narrated Jabir:The Prophet (ﷺ) bought a slave for two slaves.
3359 | Zayd Abu 'Ayyash asked Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas about the sale of the soft and white kind of wheat for barley. Sa'd said:Which of them is better? He replied: Soft and white kind of wheat. So he forbade him from it and said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sawa) say, when he was asked about buying dry dates for fresh. The Messenger of Allah (sawa) said: Are fresh dates diminished when they become dry? The (the people) replied: Yes. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade that.    Abu Dawud said: A similar tradition has also been transmitted by Isma'il b. Umayyah.
3360 | Narrated Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade to sell fresh dates for dry dates when payment is made at a later date.   Abu Dawud said: The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Sa'd (b. Abi Waqqas) from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators in a similar way.
3361 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar:The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade the sale of fruits on the tree for fruits by measure, and sale of grapes for raisins by measure, and sale of harvest for wheat by measure.
3362 | Narrated Zaid b. Thabit:The Prophet (ﷺ) gave license for the sale of 'araya for dried dates and fresh dates.
3363 | Narrated Sahl b. Abi Khathmah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade the sale of fruits for dried dates, but gave license regarding the 'araya for its sale on the basis of a calculation of their amount. But those who buy them can eat them when fresh.
3364 | Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave license regarding the sale of 'araya when the amount was less then five wasqs or five wasqs. Dawud b. al-Husain was doubtful.   Abu Dawud said: The tradition by Jabir indicates up to four wasqs.
3365 | 'Abd Rabbihi b. Sa'id al-Ansari said:'Ariyyah means that a man gives another man a palm-tree on loan, or it means that reserves one or two palm-trees from his property for his personal use, then he sells for dried dates.
3366 | Ibn Ishaq said:'Araya means that a man lends another man some palm-trees, but he (the owner) feels inconvenient that the man looks after the trees (by frequent visits). He (the borrower) sells them (to the owner) by calculation.
3367 | Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade the sale of fruits till they were clearly in good condition, forbidding it both to the seller and to the buyer.
3368 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade selling palm-trees till the dates began to ripen, and ears of corn till they were white and were safe from blight, forbidding it both to the buyer and to the seller.
3369 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade to sell spoils of war till they are appointed, and to sell palm trees till they are safe from every blight, and a man praying without tying belt.
3370 | Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdullah :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade the sale of fruits until they are ripened (tushqihah). He was asked: What do you mean by their ripening (ishqah)? He replied: They become red or yellow, and they are eaten.
3371 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade the sale of grapes till they became black and the sale of grain till it had become hard.
3372 | Yunus said:I asked Abu Zinad about the sale of fruits before they were clearly in good condition, and what was said about it.       He replied: Urwah ibn az-Zubayr reports a tradition from Sahl ibn Abi Hathmah on the authority of Zayd ibn Thabit who said: The people used to sell fruits before they were clearly in good condition. When the people cut off the fruits, and were demanded to pay the price, the buyer said: The fruits have been smitten by duman, qusham and murad fruit diseases on which they used to dispute. When their disputes which were brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) increased, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to them as an advice: No, do not sell fruits till they are in good condition, due to a large number of their disputes and differences.
3373 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade the sale of fruits till they were clearly in good condition , and (ordered that) they should not be sold but for dinar or dirham except Araya.
3374 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade selling fruits years ahead, and commanded that unforeseen loss be remitted in respect of what is affected by blight.    Abu Dawud said: The attribution of the tradition regarding the effect of blight is one-third of the produce to the Prophet (ﷺ) is not correct. This is the opinion of the people of Medina.
3375 | Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdullah :The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade sale of fruits for a number of years. One of the two narrators (Abu al-Zubair and Sa'id b. Mina') mentioned the words "sale for years" (bai' al-sinin instead of al-mu'awamah).
3376 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade the type of sale which involves risk (or uncertainty) and a transaction determined by throwing stones.
3377 | Narrated Abu Sa’id Al Khudri :The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade two types of business transactions and two ways of dressing. The two types of business transactions are mulamasah and munabadhah. As regards the two ways of dressing, they are the wrapping of the samma', and that when a man wraps himself up in a single garment while sitting in such a way that he does not cover his private parts or there is no garment on his private parts.
3378 | The tradition mentioned above has also been reported by Abu Sa'id al-Khudri from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:"Wearing the samma' means that a man puts his garment over his left shoulder and keeps his right side uncovered. Munabadhah means that a man says (to another): If I throw this garment to you, the sale will be certain. Mulamasah means that a man touches it (another's garment) with his hand and neither he unfolds it nor turns it over. When he touched it, the sale becomes binding.
3379 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Abu Said al-Khudri through a different chain of narrators from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to the same effect as narrated by both Sufyan and 'Abd al-Razzaq.
3380 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade the transaction called habal al-habalah.
3381 | A similar tradition has also been narrated by Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of transmitters. He said:Habal al-habalah means that a she-camel delivers an offspring and then the offspring which it delivers becomes pregnant.
3382 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      A time is certainly coming to mankind when people will bite each other and a rich man will hold fast, what he has in his possession (i.e. his property), though he was not commanded for that. Allah, Most High, said: "And do not forget liberality between yourselves." The men who are forced will contract sale while the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade forced contract, one which involves  some uncertainty, and the sale of fruit before it is ripe.
3383 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) having said: Allah, Most High, says: "I make a third with two partners as long as one of them does not cheat the other, but when he cheats him, I depart from them."
3384 | Narrated Urwah ibn AbulJa'd al-Bariqi:      The Prophet (ﷺ) gave him a dinar to buy a sacrificial animal or a sheep. He bought two sheep, sold one of them for a dinar, and brought him a sheep and dinar. So he invoked a blessing on him in his business dealing, and he was such that if had he bought dust he would have made a profit from it.
3385 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by 'Urwat al-Bariqi through a different chain of narrators. The wordings of this version are different from those of the previous one.
3386 | Narrated Hakim ibn Hizam:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent with him a dinar to buy a sacrificial animal for him. He bought a sheep for a dinar, sold it for two and then returned and bought a sacrificial animal for a dinar for him and brought the (extra) dinar to the Prophet (ﷺ). The Prophet (ﷺ) gave it as alms (sadaqah) and invoked blessing on him in his trading.
3387 | Narrated 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar:  I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If any of you can become like the man who had a faraq of rice, he should become like him. They (the people) asked: Who is the man who had a faraq of rice with him, Messenger of Allah ? Thereupon he narrated the story of the cave when a hillock fell on them (three persons), each of them said: Mention any best work of yours. The narrator said: The third of them said: O Allah, you know that I took a hireling for a faraq of rice. When the evening came, I presented to him his due (i.e. his wages). But he refused to take it and went away. I then cultivated it until I amassed cows and their herdsmen for him. He then met me and said: Give me my dues. I said (to him): Go to those cows and their herdsmen and take them all. He went and drove them away.
3388 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      I Ammar, and Sa'd became partners in what we would receive on the day of Badr. Sa'd then brought two prisoners, but I and Ammar did not bring anything.
3389 | Amr ibn Dinar said:I heard Ibn Umar say: We did not see any harm in sharecropping till I heard Rafi' ibn Khadij say: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has forbidden it. So I mentioned it to Tawus. He said: Ibn Abbas told me that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had not forbidden it, but said: It is better for one of you to lend to his brother than to take a prescribed sum from him.
3390 | Narrated 'Urwah b. al-Zubair:      That Zayd ibn Thabit said: May Allah forgive Rafi' ibn Khadij. I swear by Allah, I have more knowledge of Hadith than him. Two persons of the Ansar (according to the version of Musaddad) came to him who were disputing with each other. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If this is your position, then do not lease the agricultural land. The version of Musaddad has: So he (Rafi' ibn Khadij) heard his statement: Do not lease agricultural lands.
3391 | Narrated Sa'd:      We used to lease land for what grew by the streamlets and for what was watered from them.  The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade us to do that, and commanded us to lease if for gold or silver.
3392 | Narrated Hanzlah b. Qais al-Ansari: I asked Rafi' b. Khadij about the lease of land for gold and silver (i.e. for dinars and dirhams). There is no harm in it, for the people used to let out land in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for what grew by the current of water and at the banks of streamlets and at the places of cultivation. So sometimes this (portion) perished and that (portion) was saved, and sometimes this remained intact and that perished. There was no (form of) lease among the people except this. Therefore, he forbade it. But if there is something which is secure and known, then there is no harm in it. The tradition of Ibrahim is more perfect. Qutaibah said: "from Hanzalah on the authority of Rafi' ".   Abu Dawud said: A similar tradition has been transmitted by Yahya b. Sa'id from Hanzalah.
3393 | Hanzalah ibn Qays said that he asked Rafi' ibn Khadij about the lease of land. He replied:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade the leasing of land. I asked: (Did he forbid) for gold and silver (i.e. dinars and dirhams)? He replied: If it is against  gold and silver, then there is no harm in it.
3394 | Narrated Salim bin 'Abdullah b. 'Umar: Ibn 'Umar used to let out his land till it reached him that Rafi' b. Khadij al-Ansari narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade let out land. So 'Abd Allah (b. 'Umar) said: Ibn Khadij, what do you narrate from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about leasing the land? Rafi' replied to 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar: I heard both of my uncles were present in the battle of Badr say, and they narrated it to the members of the family, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade leasing land. 'Abd Allah said: I swear by Allah, I knew that land was leased in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). 'Abd Allah then feared that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) might have created something new in that matter, so he gave up leasing land.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by Ayyub, 'Ubaid Allah, Kathir b. Farqad, Malik from Nafi' on the authority of Rafi' from the Prophet (ﷺ). It has also been transmitted by al-Auzai' from Hafs b. 'Inan al-Hanafi from Nafi' from Rafi' who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Similarly, it has been transmitted by Zaid b. Abi Unaisah from al-Hakkam from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar that he went to Rafi' and asked: Have you heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say? He replied: Yes. Similarly, it has also been transmitted by 'Ikrimah b. 'Ammar from Abu al-Najashi, from Rafi' b. Khadij who said: I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say. It has also been transmitted by al-Auza'i from Abu al-Najashi from Rafi' b. Khadij from his uncle Zuhair b. Rafi' from the Prophet (ﷺ).   Abu Dawud said: The name of Abu al-Najashi is 'Ata b. Suhaib.
3395 | Narrated Rafi' b. Khadij:We used to employ people to till land for a share of it produce. He then maintained that, one of his uncles came to him and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade us from a work which beneficial to us. But obedience to Allah and His Apostle (ﷺ) is more beneficial to us. We asked : What is that ? He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If anyone has land, he should cultivate it, or lend it to his brother for cultivation. He should not rent it for a third or a quarter (of the produce) or for specified among of produce.
3396 | Ayyub said:Ya'la b. Hakim wrote to me: I heard Sulaiman b. Yasar narrating the tradition to the same effect as narrated by 'Ubaid Allah and through the same chain.
3397 | Narrated Rafi' ibn Khadij:      AbuRafi' came to us from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade us from a work which benefited us; but obedience to Allah and His Apostle (ﷺ) is more beneficial to us. He forbade that one of us cultivates land except the one which he owns or the land which a man lends him (to cultivate).
3398 | Narrated Usaid b. Zuhair: Rafi' b. Khadij came to us and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbids you from a work which is beneficial to you ; and obedience to Allah and His Prophet (ﷺ) is more beneficial to you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbids you from renting land for share of its produce and he said: If anyone if not in need of his land he should lend it to his brother or leave it.   Abu Dawud said: Shu'bah and Mufaddal b. Muhalhal have narrated it from Mansur in similar way. Shu'bah said (in his version): Usaid, nephew of Rafi' b, Khadij.
3399 | AbuJa'far al-Khatmi said:My uncle sent me and his slave to Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab. We said to him, there is something which has reached us about sharecropping. He replied: Ibn Umar did not see any harm in it until a tradition reached him from Rafi' ibn Khadij. He then came to him and Rafi'  told him that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to Banu Harithah and saw crop in the land of Zuhayr. He said: What an excellent crop of Zuhayr is! They said: It does not belong to Zuhayr. He asked: Is this not the land of Zuhayr? They said: Yes, but the crop belongs to so-and-so. He said: Take your crop and give him the wages. Rafi' said: We took our crop and gave him the wages. Sa'id (ibn al-Musayyab) said: Lend your brother or employ him for dirhams.
3400 | Narrated Rafi' ibn Khadij:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade muhaqalah and muzabanah. Those who cultivate land are three: a man who has (his own) land and he tills it: a man who has been lent land and he tills the one lent to him; a man who employs another man to till land against gold (dinars) or silver (dirhams).
3401 | Abu Dawud said:I read out (this tradition) to Sa'id b. Ya'qub al-Taliqini, and I said to him: Ibn al-Mubarak transmitted (this tradition) to you from Sa'id Abi Shuja' who said: 'Uthman b. Sahl b. Rafi' b. Khadij narrated it to me saying: I was an orphan being nourished under the guardianship of Rafi' b. Khadij and I performed Hajj with him. My brother 'Imran b. Sahl then came to me and said: We rented out land to so-and-so for two hundred dirhams. He said: Leave it, for the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade renting land.
3402 | Narrated Rafi' ibn Khadij:      Rafi' had cultivated a land. The Prophet (ﷺ) passed him when he was watering it. So he asked him: To whom does the crop belong, and to whom does the land belong? He replied: The crop is mine for my seed and labour. The half (of the crop) is mine and the half for so-and-so. He said: You conducted usurious transaction. Return the land to its owner and take your wages and cost.
3403 | Narrated Rafi' ibn Khadij:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone sows in other people's land without their permission, he has no right to any of the crop, but he may have what it cost him.
3404 | Narrated Jabir b. 'Abd Allah :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade muhaqalah, muzabanah, mukhabarah, and mu'awanah. One of the two narrators from Hammad said the word mu'awamah, and other said: "selling many years ahead". The agreed version then goes: and thunya, but gave license for 'araya.
3405 | Narrated Jabir b. 'Abd Allah :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade muzabanah, muhaqalah and thunya except it is known.
3406 | Narrated Jabir b. 'Abd Allah :I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If any of you does not leave mukhabarah, he should take notice of war from Allah and His Apostle (ﷺ).
3407 | Narrated Zaid b. Thabit:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade mukhabarah. I asked: What is mukhabarah ? He replied: That you have the land (for cultivation) for half, a third, or a quarter (of the produce).
3408 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made an agreement with the people of Khaibar to work and cultivate in return for half of the fruits or produce.
3409 | Narrated Ibn 'Umar:The Prophet (ﷺ) handed over the Jews of Khaibar the palm trees and the land of Khaibar on condition that they should employ what belonged to them in working on them, and that he should have half of the fruits.
3410 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) conquered Khaibar, and stipulated that all the land, gold and silver would belong to him. The people of Khaibar said: we know the land more than you ; so give it to us on condition that you should have half of the produce and we would have the half. He then gave it to them on that condition. When the time of picking the fruits of the palm-trees came, he sent 'Abd Allah b. Rawahah to them, and he assessed the among of the fruits of the palm-trees. This is what the people of Medina call khars (assessment). He used to say: In these palm-trees there is such-and-such amount (of produce). They would say: You assessed more to us, Ibn Rawahah (than the real amount). He would say: I first take the responsibility of assessing the fruits of the palm-trees and give you half of (the amount) I said. They would say: This is true, and on this (equity) stand the heavens and the earth. We agreed that we should take (the amount which) you said.
3411 | The tradition mentioned above has also been narrated by Ja'far b. Burqan through his chain and to the same effect. This version has:He said: He assessed, and after the words of kull safara' wa baida', he said: that is, gold and silver will belong to him.
3412 | Narrated Miqsam:When the Prophet (ﷺ) conquered Khaibar. He then narrated it like the tradition of Zaid (b. Abu al-Zarqa'). This version has: He then assessed the produce of the palm-trees and said: I take the job of picking the fruit myself, and I shall give you half of (the amount) I said.
3413 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to send Abdullah ibn Rawahah (to Khaybar), and he would assess the amount of dates when they began to ripen before they were eaten (by the Jews). He would then give choice to the Jews that they have them (on their possession) by that assessment or could assign to them (Muslims) by that assignment, so that the (amount of) zakat could be calculated before the fruit became eatable and distributed (among the people).
3414 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      When Allah bestowed Khaybar on His Prophet (ﷺ) as fay' (as a result of conquest without fighting), the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) allowed (them) to remain there as they were before, and apportioned it between him and them. He then sent Abdullah ibn Rawahah who assessed (the amount of dates) upon them.
3415 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      Ibn Rawahah assessed them (the amount of dates) at forty thousand wasqs, and when Ibn Rawahah gave them option, the Jews took the fruits in their possession and twenty thousand wasqs of dates were due from them.
3416 | Narrated Ubaydah ibn as-Samit:      I taught some persons of the people of Suffah writing and the Qur'an. A man of them presented to me a bow. I said: It cannot be reckoned  property; may I shoot with it in Allah's path? I must come to the Apostle of of Allah (ﷺ) and ask him (about it). So I came to him and said : Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), one of those whom I have been teaching writing and the Qur'an has presented me a bow, and as it cannot be reckoned property, may I shoot with it in Allah's path? He said: If you want to have a necklace of fire on you, accept it.
3417 | A similar tradition has also been transmitted by 'Ubadah b. al-Samit through a different chain of narrators, but the former tradition is more perfect.

They gave him all sorts of treatment, but nothing gave him relied. One of them said: Would that you had gone to those people who encamped with you ; some of them might have something which could give you relief to your companion.

I said to her: Do not entrust him to a supper, nor to a goldsmith, nor to a butcher.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by 'Abd al-A'la from Ibn Ishaq who said: Abu Majidah is a man of Banu Sahm narrating from 'Umar b. al-Khattab.

Hanbal): What is hoarding (hukrah) ? He replied: That on which people live.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Auza'i said: A muhtakir (one who hoards) is one who withholds supply of goods in the market.

The man refused to hand it over (the horse) to him.        He said: AbuBarzah, the companion of the Prophet (ﷺ), is to decide between me and you. They went to AbuBarzah in the corner of the army. They related this story to him.        He said: Do you agree that I make a decision between you on the basis of the decision of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?

3513 | Narrated Jabir:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: There is the right of option regarding everything which is shared, whether a dwelling or a garden. It is not lawful to sell before informing one's partner, but if he sells without informing him, he has the greatest right to it.

If the buyer dies, then the owner of the property is equal to the creditors.
3521 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Abu Bakr b. 'Adb al-Rahman b. al-Harith b. Hisham from Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators to the same effect as narrated by Malik.

This version has:If he paid something from its price, then he will be equal to the creditors in the remaining price. If a man dies and he has the very property of a man (i.e. seller), he is equal to the creditors whether he (the buyer) pays him (the price) or not.    Abu Dawud said: Malik's version of this tradition is sounder.

3527 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: There are people from the servants of Allah who are neither prophets nor martyrs; the prophets and martyrs will envy them on the Day of Resurrection for their rank from Allah, the Most High.        They (the people) asked: Tell us, Messenger of Allah, who are they?  He replied: They are people who love one another for the spirit of Allah (i.e. the Qur'an), without having any mutual kinship and giving property to one. I swear by Allah, their faces will glow and they will be (sitting) in (pulpits of) light. They will have no fear (on the Day) when the people will have fear, and they will not grieve when the people will grieve.        He then recited the following Qur'anic verse: "Behold! Verily for the friends of Allah there is no fear, nor shall they grieve."

Abu Dawud said: Hammad b. Abi Sulaiman added in his version: "When you need." But this (addition) is munkar (not authoritative).
3530 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, I have property and children, and my father finishes my property.

I said (to the man: Take one thousand (dirhams) which they have taken from you (by cheating). He said: No, my father has told me that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Pay the deposit to him who deposited it with you, and do not betray him who betrays you.

He said him: I have given my son al-Nu'man a gift, and 'Umrah has asked me to call you as witness to it. He asked him: Have you children other than him?  He said: I replied: Yes. He again asked: Have you given the rest of them the same as you have given al-Nu'man ? He said: No. Some of these narrators said in their version (that the Prophet said:) This in injustice. The others said in their version (that the Prophet said:) This is under force. So call some other person than me as witness to it. Mughirah said in his version: (The Prophet asked): Are you not pleased with the fact that all of them may be equal in virtue and grace ? He replied: Yes. He said: Then call some other person than me as witness to it. Mujahid mentioned in his version: They have right to you that you should do justice to them, as you have right to them that they should do good to you.   Abu Dawud said: In the version of al-Zuhri some (narrators) said: (Have you given) to all your sons ? and some (narrators) said: Your children.

Sulaiman also narrated the tradition like that of Malik.

When two litigants sit in front of you, do not decide till you hear what the other has to say as you heard what the first had to say; for it is best that you should have a clear idea of the best decision. He said: I had been a judge (for long); or he said (the narrator is doubtful): I have no doubts about a decision afterwards.
3583 | Umm Salamah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:"I am only a human being, and you bring your disputes to me, some perhaps being more eloquent in their plea than others, so that I give judgement on their behalf according to what I hear from them.

Banu an-Nadir used to pay half blood-money if they killed any-one from Banu Qurayzah. When Banu Qurayzah killed anyone from Banu an-Nadir, they would pay full blood-money. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made it equal between them.
3592 | Some companions of Mu'adh ibn Jabal said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) intended to send Mu'adh ibn Jabal to the Yemen, he asked: How will you judge when the occasion of deciding a case arises?        He replied: I shall judge in accordance with Allah's Book.  He asked: (What will you do) if you do not find any guidance in Allah's Book?  He replied: (I shall act) in accordance with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        He asked: (What will you do) if you do not find any guidance in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and in Allah's Book?        He replied: I shall do my best to form an opinion and I shall spare no effort.

Abdullah said:        That was just the work of the Devil who was picking it with his hand, and when he uttered the spell on it, he desisted. All you need to do is to say as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say: Remove the harm, O Lord of men, and heal. Thou art the Healer. There is no remedy but Thine which leaves no disease behind.

3889 | Anas reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying :No spell is to be used except for the evil eye, or sting of  poisonous insects, or bleeding. The narrator al-‘Abhas did mention the words “evil eye”. The is the version of Sulaiman b. Dawud.

I then came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him of it.        He asked: Is it only this? The narrator, Musaddad, said in his other version: Did you say anything other than this?  I said: No.  He said: Take it, for by my life, some accept if for a worthless chain, but you have done so for a genuine one.
3897 | Kharijah b. al-Salt quoted his parental uncle as saying that he passed (some people) :He recited Surat al-Fatihah over him for three days morning and evening. Whenever he finished it, he collected some of his saliva and spat it out, and he seemed as if he were set free from a bond. They gave him something as payment. He then came to the Prophet (ﷺ).

3899 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      A man who was stung by a scorpion was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: Had he said the word: "I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of what He created, "he would not have been stung, or he said, "It would not have harmed him."

I shall apply charm ; but we asked you for hospitality and you denied it to us. I shall not apply charm until you give me some payment. So they promised to give some sheep to him. He came to him and recited Surat al-Fatihah over him and spat till he was cured, and ha seemed as if he were set free from a bond. So they gave him the payment that was agreed between them. They said : Apportion them. The man who applied charm said : Do not do it until we approach the Apostle of allah (ﷺ) said: From where did you learn that it was a charm ? you have done right. Apportion them, and give me a share along with you.
3901 | Narrated Alaqah ibn Sahar at-Tamimi:      We proceeded from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and came to a clan of the Arabs.        They said: We have been told that you have brought what is good from this man. Have you any medicine or a charm, for we have a lunatic in chains?        We said: Yes. Then they brought a lunatic in chains.  He said: I recited Surat al-Fatihah over him for three days, morning and evening. Whenever I finished it, I would collect my saliva and spit it out, and he seemed as if he were set free from a bond. He said: They gave me some payment, but I said: No, not until I ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        He (the Prophet) said: Accept it, for, by my life, some accept it for a worthless charm, but you have done so for a genuine one.
3902 | Narrated A'ishah:the wife of Prophet (ﷺ) said: When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) suffered from some pain, he recited mu'awwadhat in his heart and blew (them over him). When the pain became severe, I recited (them) over him and wiped him with his hand in the hope of its blessing.

They said: Allah and His Apostle know best. He said: This morning there were among mt servants one who believes in me and one who disbelieves. The one who said: "We have been given rain by Allah's grace and mercy" is the one who believes in me and disbelieves in the star ; but the one who said: "We have been given rain by such and such a rain star," is the one who disbelieves in me and believes in the star.
3907 | Narrated Qabisah:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Augury from the flight of birds, taking evil omens and the practice of pressomancy pertain to divination. Tarq: It is used in the sense of divination in which women threw stones. 'Iyafah: It means geomancy by drawing lines.
3908 | Narrated Muhammed b. Ja'far:On the authority of 'Awf: 'Iyafah means to makes the birds fly by threatening them. Tarq means lines drawn on the earth.
3909 | Narrated Mu'awiyah b. al-Hakam al-Sulami:I said: Messenger of Allah! among us there are men who practice divination by drawing lines. He said: There was a Prophet who drew lines, so if anyone does it as he drew lines, that is right.
3910 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Taking omens is polytheism; taking omens is polytheism. He said it three times. Every one of us has some, but Allah removes it by trust (in Him).
3911 | Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying : There is no infection, no evil, omen or serpent, in a hungry belly and no hamah. A nomadic Arab asked: How is it that when camels are in the sand as if they were gazelles and a mangy camel comes among them and it gives them mange ? He replied: Who infected the first one ?    Ma'mar, quoting al-Zuhri said: A man told me that Abu Hurairah narrated to him saying that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: A diseased camel should not be brought with a healthy camel to drink water. He said: The man then consulted him and said: Did you not tell us that Prophet (ﷺ) had said: There is no infection, no serpent in a hungry belly and no hamah? He replied: I did not transmit it to you. Al-Zuhri said: Abu Salamah said: He had narrated it and I did not hear that Abu Hurairah had ever forgotten any tradition except this one.      Note: The majority of scholars interpret this to mean that these things in and of themselves do not transmit or cause harm through supernatural or hidden means but that Allah is ultimately in control and any fearful superstition around these is false.
3912 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: There is no infection, no hamah, no other promising rain, and no serpent in a hungry belly.
3913 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no ghoul.

3915 | Muhammad b. al-Musaffa said to us on the authority of Baqiyyah. He said:I asked Muhammad b. Rashid about the meaning of the word hamah. He replied: The pre-Islamic Arabs used to say: When anyone dies and is buried, a bird comes forth from his grave. I asked: What did he mean by safar ? He said: I heard that the pre-Islamic Arabs used to take evil omen from safar. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no safar. Muhammad (b. Rashid) said: We heard someone say: It is a pain in the stomach. They said that it was infection. Hence he said: There is no safar.
3916 | Narrated Anas:The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: There is no infection* and no evil omen, and I like a good omen. Good omen means a good word.  * The majority of scholars interpret this to mean that these things in and of themselves do not transmit or cause harm through supernatural or hidden means but that Allah is ultimately in control and any fearful superstition around these is false.
3917 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) heard a word, and he liked it, he said: We took your omen from your mouth.
3918 | Narrated 'Ata:People said: safar is a pain within the belly. I asked: What is hamah ? He said: People said (believed) that hamah which is an owl or a nightbird and which shrieks is the spirit of men. It is not the spirit of men. It is an animal.
3919 | Narrated Urwah ibn Amir al-Qurashi:      When taking omens was mentioned in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ), he said: The best type is the good omen, and it does not turn back a Muslim. If one of you sees anything he dislikes, he should say: O Allah, no one brings good things except Thee, and no one averts evil things except Thee and there is no might and power but in Allah.
3920 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) did not take omens from anything, but when he sent out an agent he asked about his name. If it pleased him, he was glad about it, and his cheerfulness on that account was visible in his face. If he disliked his name, his displeasure on that account was visible in his face. When he entered a village, he asked about its name, and if it pleased him, he was glad about it, and his cheerfulness on that account was visible in his face. But if he disliked its name, his displeasure on that account was visible in his face.
3921 | Narrated Sa'd ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no hamah, no infection and no evil omen; if there is in anything an evil omen, it is a house, a horse, and a  woman.
3922 | It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"An omen is in a dwelling, a woman or a horse."   Abu Dawud said: This tradition was read out to al-Harith b. Miskin and I was witness. It was said to him that Ibn Qasim told him that Malik was asked about evil omen in a horse and in a house. He replied: There are many houses in which people lived and perished and again others lived therein and they also perished. This is its explanation so far as we know. Allah knows best.   Abu Dawud said: 'Umar (ra) said: A mat in a house better than a woman who does not give birth to a child.
3923 | Yahya ibn Abdullah ibn Buhayr said that he was informed by one who had heard Farwah ibn Musayk tell that he said:Messenger of Allah! we have land called Abyan, which is the land where we have our fields and grow our crops, but it is very unhealthy.

3924 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      A man said: Messenger of Allah! we were in an abode in which our numbers and our goods were many and changed to an abode in which our numbers and our goods became few. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Leave it, for it is reprehensible.

3927 | Narrated 'Amr b. Shu'aib:      On his father's authority, told that his grandfather reported the Prophet (ﷺ) said: If any slave entered into an agreement to buy his freedom for one hundred uqiyahs and he pays them all but ten, he remains a slave (until he pays the remaining ten); and if a slave entered into an agreement to purchase his freedom for one hundred dinars, and he pays them all but ten dinars, he remains a slave (until he pays the remaining ten).   Abu Dawud said: This narrator 'Abbas al-Jariri is not the same person. They said: It is misunderstanding. He is some other narrator.
3928 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to us: If one of you has a slave, and he enters into an agreement to purchase his freedom, and can pay the full price, she must veil herself from him.
3929 | 'Urwah quoting from 'Aishah said that Barirah came to her seeking her help to purchase her freedom, and she did not pay anything for her freedom. 'Aishah said to her:Return to your people ; if you like that I make payment for the purchase of your freedom on your behalf and I shall have the right to inherit from you, I shall do so. Barirah mentioned it to her people, but they refused and said: If she wants to purchase your freedom for reward from Allah, she may do so, but the right to inherit from her shall be ours. She mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Purchase her (freedom) and set her free, for the right of inheritance belongs to only to the one who set a person free. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then stood up and said: If anyone makes a condition which is not in Allah's Book, he has no right to it, even if he stipulates it hundred times. Allah's condition is more valid and binding.
3930 | 'Aishah said:Barirah came seeking my help to purchase her freedom. She said: I have arranged with my people to buy my freedom for nine 'uqiyahs: one to be paid annually. So help me. She ('Aishah) said: If your people are willing that I should count them ('uqiyahs) out to them all at one time and set you free and that I shall have the right to inherit from you, I shall do so. She then went to her people. The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition like the version of al-Zuhri. He added to the wordings of the Prophet (ﷺ) in the last: What is the matter with people that one of you says: Set free, O so-and-so, and the right of inheritance belongs to me. The right of inheritance belongs to the one who has set a person free.
3931 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      Juwayriyyah, daughter of al-Harith ibn al-Mustaliq, fell to the lot of Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammas, or to her cousin. She entered into an agreement to purchase her freedom. She was a very beautiful woman, most attractive to the eye.        Aisha said: She then came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asking him for the purchase of her freedom. When she was standing at the door, I looked at her with disapproval. I realised that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would look at her in the same way that I had looked.        She said: Messenger of Allah, I am Juwayriyyah, daughter of al-Harith, and something has happened to me, which is not hidden from you. I have fallen to the lot of Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammas, and I have entered into an agreement to purchase of my freedom. I have come to you to seek assistance for the purchase of my freedom.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Are you inclined to that which is better?  She asked: What is that, Messenger of Allah?  He replied: I shall pay the price of your freedom on your behalf, and I shall marry you.        She said: I shall do this.  She (Aisha) said: The people then heard that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had married Juwayriyyah. They released the captives in their possession and set them free, and said: They are the relatives of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) by marriage. We did not see any woman greater than Juwayriyyah who brought blessings to her people. One hundred families of Banu al-Mustaliq were set free on account of her.    Abu dawud said: This evidence shows that a Muslim ruler may marry a slave woman himself.
3932 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      Safinah said: I was a slave of Umm Salamah, and she said: I shall emancipate you, but I stipulate that you must serve the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as long as you live. I said: Even if you do not make a stipulation, I shall not leave the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She then emancipated me and made the stipulation with me.
3933 | Narrated Abu al-Malih:      On his father's authority (this is AbulWalid's version): A man emancipated a share in a slave and the matter was mentioned to the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: Allah has no partner.       Ibn Kathir added in his version: The Prophet (ﷺ) allowed his emancipation.
3934 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      A man emancipated his share in a slave. The Prophet (ﷺ) allowed his (full) emancipation, and required him to pay the rest of his price.
3935 | Qatadah narrated with his chain of narrators:The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If a man emancipates a slave shared by him with another man, his emancipation rests with him (who emancipated his share). This is the version of Ibn Suwaid.
3936 | Qatadah narrated with his chain of narrators. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:If anyone emancipates his share in a slave, he emancipates him (completely) by his property if he has property. The narrator Ibn al-Muthanna did not mention al-Nadr b. Anas. This is the version of Ibn Suwaid.
3937 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone emancipates a share in his slave, he should completely emancipate him if he has money; but if he has none, then slave will be required to work (to pay for his freedom), but he must not be overburdened.
3938 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone emancipates his share in a slave, he is to be completely emancipated by his money if he has money.

I said: Give me some advice.  He said: Do not abuse anyone. He said that he did not abuse a freeman, or a slave, or a camel or a sheep thenceforth.

When he was not praying he was occupied in glorifying Allah and exalting Him until he went to his family. Once he passed us when we were with AbudDarda'.        AbudDarda' said to him: Tell us a word which benefits us and does not harm you.        He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent out a contingent and it came back.

He said: Take it from me and I am a boy of the tribe Ghifar. What do you think about his statement?        He replied: I think his reward was lost.  Another man heard it and said: I do not think that there is any harm in it.  They quarrelled until the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) heard it, and he said: Glory be to Allah! There is no harm if he is rewarded and praised. I saw that AbudDarda' was pleased with it and began to raise his hand to him and say: Did you hear it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?        He said: Yes. He continued to repeat it to him so often that I thought he was going to kneel down. He said: On another day he again passed us.        AbudDarda' said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and does not harm you.        He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to us: One who spends on (the maintenance of) horses (for jihad) is like the one who spreads his hand to give alms (sadaqah) and does not withhold it.

AbudDarda' said to him: (tell us) a word which benefits us and does not harm you.        He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: You are coming to your brethren; so tidy your mounts and tidy your dress, until you are like a mole among the people.

Perhaps he said: "even to the extent of thong of my sandal (shirak na'li)", or he he said: "to the extent of strap of my sandal (shis'i na'li)". Is it pride? He replied: No, pride is disdaining what is true and despising people.

A man asked him: Do you think it a calamity?  He replied: Why should I not consider it a calamity when it is a fact that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to take him on his lap, saying: This belongs to me and Husayn belongs to Ali?        The man of Banu Asad said: (He was) a live coal which Allah has extinguished.  Al-Miqdam said: Today I shall continue to make you angry and make you hear what you dislike.

Khalid said: Mu'awiyah then ordered to give him what he did not order to give to his two companions, and gave a stipend of two hundred (dirhams) to his son. Al-Miqdam then divided it among his companions, and the man of Banu Asad did not give anything to anyone from the property he received.

He said: I swear by Allah, if you read it, you would have found it. He then read: What the Apostle has brought you accept, and what he has forbidden refrain from it. She said: I find some of these thing in you wife. He said: Enter (the house) and see. She said: I then entered (the house) and came out. He asked: What did you see ?

4202 | 'Amr b. Shu'aib, on his father's authority, told that his grandfather reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Do not pluck out grey hair.

4211 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      When a man who had dyed himself with henna passed by the Prophet (ﷺ), he said: How fine this is! When another man who had dyed himself with henna and katam passed by, he said: This is better than that. Then another man who had dyed himself with yellow dye, passed by, he said: This is better than all that.
4212 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: At the end of time there will be people who will use this black dye like the crops of doves who will not experience the fragrance of Paradise.
4213 | Narrated Thawban:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went on a journey, the last member of his family he saw was Fatimah, and the first he visited on his return was Fatimah. Once when he returned from an expedition she had hung up a hair-cloth, or a curtain, at her door, and adorned al-Hasan and al-Husayn with silver bracelets. So when he arrived, he did not enter. Thinking that he had been prevented from entering by what he had seen, she tore down the curtain, unfastened the bracelets from the boys and cut them off.        They went weeping to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and when he had taken them from them, he said: Take this to so and so's family. Thawban. In Medina, these are my family, and I did not like them to enjoy their good things in the present life. Buy Fatimah a necklace or asb, Thawban, and two ivory bracelets.

The people then took signet-rings of gold. When he saw that they had taken them (like his ring) he threw it away and said: I shall never wear it. He then fashioned a silver ring and engraved on it "Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah". Then Abu Bakr wore it after him, then 'Umar wore it after Abu Bakr, and the 'Uthman wore it after 'Umar till it fell down in a well called Aris.   Abu Dawud said: The people did not disagree on 'Uthman till the signet-rin fell down from his hand.
4219 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Ibn 'Umar through a different chain of narrators from the Prophet (ﷺ).

4222 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) disliked ten things: Yellow colouring, meaning khaluq, dyeing grey hair, trailing the lower garment, wearing a gold signet-ring, a woman decking herself before people who are not within the prohibited degrees, throwing dice, using spells except with the Mu'awwidhatan, wearing amulets, withdrawing the penis before the semen is discharged, in the case of a woman who is wife or not a wife, and having intercourse with a woman who is suckling a child; but he did not declare them to be prohibited.   Abu Dawud said: Only the transmitters of Basrah have transmitted this tradition.
4223 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he was wearing a signet-ring of yellow copper. He said to him: How is it that I notice the odour of idols in you? So he threw it away, and came wearing an iron signet ring. He (the Prophet) said: What is it that I see you wearing the adornment of the inhabitants of Hell? So he threw it away. He asked: Messenger of Allah, what material I must use? He said: Make it of silver, but do not weigh it as much as a mithqal,   The narrator Muhammad did not say: " 'Abd Allah b. Muslim," and al-Hasan did not say: "al-Sulami al-Marwazi."
4224 | Iyas b. al-Harith b. al-Mu'aiqib quoting his grandfather said and his grandfather from his mother's side was Abu Dhubab:The signet-ring of the Prophet (ﷺ) was of iron polished with silver. Sometimes it remained in my possession. Al-Mu'ayqib was in charge of the signet-ring of the Prophet (ﷺ).
4225 | Narrated Ali:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Say: O Allah, guide me, and set me right. Remember by guidance (hidayah) the showing of the straight path, and remember by setting right (sadad) the setting right of an arrow. Then pointing to the middle finger and the one next to it, he said: He forbade me to wear a signet-ring on this finger of mine or on this (Asim was doubtful). He forbade me to wear qassiyyah (qasi garments) and mitharah. Abu Burdah said: We asked 'Ali: What is qasiyyah ? He said: These are garments imported to us from Syria or Egypt. They are stripped and marked like citrons. And mitharah was a thing made by women for their husbands.
4226 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) used to wear the signet-ring on his right hand.

4228 | Nafi' said that Ibn 'Umar used to wear his signet-ring on his left hand.
4229 | Muhammad ibn Ishaq said:I saw as-Salt ibn Abdullah ibn Nawfal ibn AbdulMuttalib wearing the signet-ring on his right small finger. I asked: What is this?

4232 | AbdurRahman ibn Tarafah said that his grandfather Arfajah ibn As'ad who had his nose cut off at the battle of al-Kilab got a silver nose, but it developed a stench, so the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered him to get a gold nose.
4233 | The tradition mentioned above (No. 4220) has also been transmitted by Arfajah ibn As'ad through a different chain to the same effect.       Yazid said:I asked AbulAshhab: Did AbdurRahman ibn Tarafah meet his grandfather Arfajah? He replied: Yes.
4234 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by 'Arfajah through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.
4235 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) got some ornaments presented by Negus as a gift to him. They contained a gold ring with an Abyssinian stone. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turning his attention from it took it by means of a stick or his finger, then called Umamah, daughter of Abul'As and daughter of his daughter Zaynab, and said: Wear it, my dear daughter.
4236 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone wants to put a ring of fire on one he loves, let him put a gold ring on him: if anyone wants to put a necklace of fire on one he loves, let him put a gold necklace on him, and if anyone wants to put a bracelet of fire on one he loves let him put a gold bracelet on him. Keep to silver and amuse yourselves with it.
4237 | Narrated A sister of Hudhayfah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying : You women folk, have in silver something with which you adorn yourselves. I assure you that any woman of you who adorns herself with gold which she displays will be punished for it.

4239 | Narrated Mu'awiyah ibn AbuSufyan:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade to ride on panther skins and to wear gold except a little.    Abu Dawud said: The narrator Abu Qilabah did not meet Mu'awiyah.
4240 | Narrated Hudhaifa:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood among us (to give us an address) and he left out nothing that would happen up to the last hour without telling of it. Some remembered it and some forgot,  and these Companions of his have known it. When something of it which I have forgotten happens, I remembered it, just as a man remembers another's face when he is a away and recognizes him when he sees him.
4241 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: four (majestic) trials (fitnahs) will take place among this community, and in their end there will be destruction.
4242 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      When we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he talked about periods of trial (fitnahs), mentioning many of them.        When he mentioned the one when people should stay in their houses, some asked him: Messenger of Allah, what is the trial (fitnah) of staying at home?        He replied: It will be flight and plunder. Then will come a test which is pleasant. Its murkiness is due to the fact that it is produced by a man from the people of my house, who will assert that he belongs to me, whereas he does not, for my friends are only the God-fearing. Then the people will unite under a man who will be like a hip-bone on a rib. Then there will be the little black trial which will leave none of this community without giving him a slap, and when people say that it is finished, it will be extended. During it a man will be a believer in the morning and an infidel in the evening, so that the people will be in two camps: the camp of faith which will contain no hypocrisy, and the camp of hypocrisy which will contain no faith. When that happens, expect the Antichrist (Dajjal) that day or the next.
4243 | Narrated Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman:      I swear by Allah, I do not know whether my companions have forgotten or have pretended to forgot. I swear by Allah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not omit a leader of a wrong belief (fitnah)--up to the end of the world--whose followers reach the number of three hundred and upwards but he mentioned to us his name, his father's name and the name of his tribe.
4244 | Narrated Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman:      Subay' ibn Khalid said: I came to Kufah at the time when Tustar was conquered. I took some mules from it. When I entered the mosque (of Kufah), I found there some people of moderate stature, and among them was a man whom you could recognize when you saw him that he was from the people of Hijaz.        I asked: Who is he?  The people frowned at me and said: Do you not recognize him? This is Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, the companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        Then Hudhayfah said: People used to ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about good, and I used to ask him about evil. Then the people stared hard at him.        He said: I know the reason why you dislike it. I then asked: Messenger of Allah, will there be evil as there was before, after this good which Allah has bestowed on us?        He replied: Yes.  I asked: Wherein does the protection from it lie?  He replied: In the sword.  I asked: Messenger of Allah, what will then happen?        He replied: If Allah has on Earth a caliph who flays your back and takes your property, obey him, otherwise die holding onto the stump of a tree.        I asked: What will come next?  He replied: Then the Antichrist (Dajjal) will come forth accompanied by a river and fire. He who falls into his fire will certainly receive his reward, and have his load taken off him, but he who falls into his river will have his load retained and his reward taken off him.        I then asked: What will come next?  He said: The Last Hour will come.
4245 | The traditions mentioned above has also been transmitted by Khalid b. Khalid al-Yashkuri through different chain of narrators. This version has:I (Hudhaifah) asked : Will any be spared after the use of the sword ? He replied: There will be remnant with specks in its eye and an illusory truce. He then transmitted the rest of the tradition. Qatadah applied this to the apostasy during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr.   The word aqdha' (sing. qadhan) means specks, hudnah means truce and dakhan means malice.
4246 | Narrated Hudhayfah:      The tradition mentioned above (No. 4232) has also been transmitted through a different chain of narrators by Nasr ibn Asim al-Laythi who said: We came to al-Yashkuri with a group of the people of Banu Layth.        He asked: Who are these people?  We replied: Banu Layth. We have come to you to ask you about the tradition of Hudhayfah. He then mentioned the tradition and said: I asked: Messenger of Allah, will there be evil after this good?        He replied: There will be trial (fitnah) and evil.  I asked: Messenger of Allah, will there be good after this evil?  He replied: Learn the Book of Allah, Hudhayfah, and adhere to its contents. He said it three times.        I asked: Messenger of Allah, will there be good after this evil?  He replied: An illusory truce and a community with specks in its eye.  I asked: Messenger of Allah, what do you mean by an illusory community?        He replied: The hearts of the people will not return to their former condition.  I asked: Messenger of Allah, will there be evil after this good?  He replied: There will be wrong belief which will blind and deafen men to the truth in which there will be summoners at the gates of Hell. If you, Hudhayfah, die adhering to a stump, it will be better for you than following any of them.
4247 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Hudhaifah through a different chain of narrators from the Prophet (ﷺ). This version says:He said: If you do not find a caliph in those days, then flee away until you die, even of you die holding on (to a stump of a tree). I asked: What will come next ? He replied: If a man wants the mare to bring forth a foal, it will not deliver in till the Last Hour comes.
4248 | Narrated Abdullah b. 'Amr:The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: If a man takes an oath of allegiance to a leader, and puts his hand on his hand and does it with the sincerity of his heart, he should obey him as much as possible. If another man comes and contests him, then behead the other one. The narrator 'Abd al-Rahman said: I asked: Have you heard this from the Messenger of Allah ? He said: My ears heard it and my heart retained it. I said: Your cousin Mu'awiyah orders us that we should do this and do that. He replied: Obey him in the acts of obedience to Allah, and disobey him in the acts of disobedience to Allah.
4249 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying: Woe to Arabs because of evil which has drawn near! He will escape who restrains his hand.
4250 | Abu Dawud said:Ibn 'Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: The Muslims will soon be besieged up to Medina, so that their most distant frontier outpost will be Salah.
4251 | Al-Zuhri said:Salah is near Khaibar.
4252 | Narrated Thawban:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Allah, the Exalted, folded for me the earth, or he said (the narrator is doubtful): My Lord folded for me the earth, so much so that I saw its easts and wests (i.e. the extremities). The kingdom of my community will reach as far as the earth was floded for me. The two treasures, the red and the white, were bestowed on me. I prayed to my Lord that He may not destroy my community by prevailing famine, and not give their control to an enemy who annihilates then en masse except from among themselves. My Lord said to me: Muhammad, If I make a decision, it is not withdrawn ; and I shall not destroy them by prevailing famine, and I shall not give their control to an enemy, except from among themselves, who exterminates them en masse, even if they are stormed from all sides of the earth ; only a section of them will destroy another section, and a section will captive another section. I am afraid about my community of those leaders who will lead astray. When the sword is used among my people, it will not be withdrawn from them till the Day of Resurrection, and the Last Hour will not come before the tribes of my people attach themselves to the polytheists and tribes of my people worship idols. There will be among my people thirty great liars each of them asserting that he is (Allah's) prophet, where as I am the seal of the Prophet  s after whom (me) there will be no prophet ; and a section of my people will continue to hold to the truth - (according to the Ibn Isa's version: (will continue to dominate) - the agreed version goes: "and will not be injured by those who oppose them, till Allah's command comes."
4253 | Narrated AbuMalik al-Ash'ari:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Allah  has protected you from three things: that your Prophet should not invoke a curse on you and should all perish, that those who follow what is false should not prevail over those who follow the truth, and that you should not all agree in an error.
4254 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The mill of Islam will go round till the year thirty-five, or thirty-six, or thirty-seven; then if they perish, they will have followed the path of those who perished before them, but if their religion is maintained, it will be maintained for seventy years. I asked: Does it mean seventy years which remain or seventy years which are gone by? He replied: It means (seventy years) that are gone by.   Abu Dawud said: Those who recorded Khirash, the name of a narrator, are wrong. (The correct name is Hirash)
4255 | Narrated Abu Hurairah :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: The time will become short, knowledge will be decreased, civil strife (fitan) will appear, niggardliness will be case into people's heart, and harj will be prevalent. He was asked: Messenger of Allah! what is it: He replied: Slaughter, slaughter.
4256 | Narrated AbuBakrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There will be a period of commotion in which the one who lies down will be better than the one who sits, and the one who sits is better than the one who stands, and the one who stands is better than the one who walks, and the one who walks is better than the one who runs (to it).        He asked: What do you command me to do, Messenger of Allah?  He replied: He who has camels should remain with his camels, he who has sheep should remain with his sheep, and he who has land should remain with his land.        He asked: If anyone has more of these, (what should he do)?        He replied: He should take his sword, strike its edge on a stone, and then escape if he can.
4257 | Narrated Sa'd ibn AbuWaqqas:      I asked: Messenger of Allah! tell me if someone enters my house and extends his hands to kill me (what should I do?) The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied: Be like the two sons of Adam. The narrator Yazid (ibn Khalid) then recited the verse: "If thou dost stretch they hand against me to slay me." [5:28]
4258 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud ; Khuraym ibn Fatik:      The tradition mentioned above (No. 4243) has also been transmitted by Ibn Mas'ud through a different chain of narrators.        Ibn Mas'ud said: I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: He then mentioned a portion of the tradition narrated by AbuBakrah (No. 4243).        This version adds: He (the Prophet) said: All their slain will go to Hell.  I (Wabisah) asked: When will this happen Ibn Mas'ud?        He replied: This is the period of turmoil (harj) when a man will not be safe from his associates.        I asked: What do you command me (to do) if I happen to live during that period?  He replied: You should restrain your tongue and hand and stay at home.        When Uthman was slain, I recollected this tradition. I then rode (on a camel) and came to Damascus. There I met Khuraym ibn Fatik and mentioned this tradition to him. He swore by Allah, there was no god but He, he had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), as Ibn Mas'ud transmitted it to me (Wabisah).
4259 | Narrated AbuMusa al-Ash'ari:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Before the Last Hour there will be commotions like pieces of a dark night in which a man will be a believer in the morning and an infidel in the evening, or a believer in the evening and infidel in the morning. He who sits during them will be better than he who gets up and he who walks during them is better than he who runs. So break your bows, cut your bowstrings and strike your swords on stones. If people then come in to one of you, let him be like the better of Adam's two sons.
4260 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      AbdurRahman ibn Samurah said: I was holding the hand of Ibn Umar on one of the ways of Medina. He suddenly came to a hanging head. He said: Unhappy is the one who killed him. When he proceeded, he said: I do not consider him but unfortunate. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If anyone goes to a man of my community in order to kill him, he should say in this way, the one who kills will go to Hell and the one who is killed will go to Paradise.    Abu Dawud said: Al-Thawri has transmitted it from 'Awn from 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sumair or Sumairah ; and Laith b. Abu Sulaim transmitted it from 'Awn from 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sumairah.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Hasan b. 'Ali said to me: Abu al-Walid transmitted this tradition to us from Abu 'Awanah, and said: It (the name Ibn Samurah) is in my notebook Ibn Sabrah. The people also transmitted it as Samurah and Sumairah. These are wordings of Abu al-Walid.
4261 | Narrated AbuDharr:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: O AbuDharr.  I replied: At thy service and at thy pleasure, Messenger of Allah.  He then mentioned the tradition in which he said: What will you do when there the death of the people (in Medina) and a house will reach the value of a slave (that is, a grave will be sold for a slave).        I replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. Or he said: What Allah and His Apostle choose for me.        He said: You must show endurance. Or he said; you may endure. He then said to me: What will you do, AbuDharr, when you see the Ahjar az-Zayt covered with blood?        I replied: What Allah and His Apostle choose for me.        He said: You must go to those who are like-minded.        I asked: Should I not take my sword and put it on my shoulder?  He replied: you would then associate yourself with the people.  I then asked: What do you order me to do?  You must stay at home.  I asked: (What should I do) if people enter my house and find me?        He replied: If you are afraid the gleam of the sword may dazzle you, put the end of your garment over your face in order that (the one who kills you) may bear the punishment of your sins and his.    Abu Dawud said: No one mentioned al-Mush'ath in the chain of this tradition except Hammad b. Zaid.
4262 | Narrated AbuMusa al-Ash'ari:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Before you there will be commotions like pieces of a dark night in which a man will be a believer in the morning and an infidel in the evening. He who sits during them will be better than he who gets up, and he who gets up during them is better than he who walks, and he who walks during them is better than he who runs. They (the people) said: What do you order us to do? He replied: Keep to your houses.
4263 | Narrated Al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad:      I swear by Allah, I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: The happy man is he who avoids dissensions: happy is the man who avoids dissensions; happy is the man who avoids dissensions: but how fine is the man who is afflicted and shows endurance.
4264 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There will be civil strife (fitnah) which will render people deaf, dumb and blind regarding what is right. Those who contemplate it will be drawn by it, and giving rein to the tongue during it will be like smiting with the sword.
4265 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There will be civil strife which wipe out the Arabs, and their slain will go to Hell. During it the tongue will be more severe than blows of the sword.    Abu Dawud said: Al-Thawri transmitted it from Laith, from Tawus on the authority of Al-A'jam.
4266 | 'Abd Allah b. 'Abd al-Quddus mentioned in his version:Ziyad, one who has white ears.
4267 | Narrated Abu Sa’id Al Khudri :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: A Muslim's best property will soon be sheep which he will take to the tops of the mountains and the places where the rain falls, fleeing with his religion from the civil strife (fitan).
4268 | Ahnaf b. Qais said:I came out with the intention of (participating in) fighting. Abu Bakrah met me and said: Go back, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: When two Muslims face each other with their swords, the killer and the slain will go to Hell. He asked: Messenger of Allah, this is the killer (so naturally he should go to Hell), but what is the matter with the slain ? He replied: He intended to kill his companion.
4269 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted briefly by al-Hasan through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.
4270 | Narrated AbudDarda' and Ubadah ibn as-Samit:      Khalid ibn Dihqan said: When we were engaged in the battle of Constantinople at Dhuluqiyyah, a man of the people of Palestine, who was one of their nobility and elite and whose rank was known to them, came forward. He was called Hani ibn Kulthum ibn Sharik al-Kinani. He greeted Abdullah ibn Zakariyya who knew his rank.        Khalid said to us: Abdullah ibn AbuZakariyya told us: I heard Umm ad-Darda' say: I heard AbudDarda' say: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: It is hoped that Allah may forgive every sin, except in the case of one who dies a polytheist, or one who purposely kills a believer.        Hani ibn Kulthum ar-Rabi' then said: I heard Mahmud ibn ar-Rabi' transmitting a tradition from Ubadah ibn as-Samit who transmitted from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who said: If a man kills a believer unjustly, Allah will not accept any action or duty of his, obligatory or supererogatory.       Khalid then said to us: Ibn AbuZakariyya transmitted a tradition to us from Umm ad-Darda' on the authority of AbudDarda' from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who said: A believer will continue to go on quickly and well so long as he does not shed unlawful blood; when he sheds unlawful blood, he becomes slow and heavy-footed.       A similar tradition has been transmitted by Hani ibn Kulthum from Mahmud ibn ar-Rabi' on the authority of Ubadah ibn as-Samit from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
4271 | Khalid b. Dihqan said:I asked Yahya b. Yahya al-Ghassani about the word i'tabata bi qatlihi spoken by him (as mentioned in the previous tradition). He said: It means those people who fight during the period of commotion (fitnah), and one of them kills (the other people) presuming that he is in the right, so he does not beg pardon of Allah of that (sin).   Abu Dawud said: And he said: The word fa'tabata means "he shed blood profusely"
4272 | Narrated Zayd ibn Thabit:      The verse "If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell to abide therein for ever" was revealed six months after the verse "And those who invoke not with Allah any other god, nor slay such life as Allah has made sacred, except for just cause in Surat al-Furqan.
4273 | Sa'id bin Jubair said:I asked Ibn 'Abbas (about the verse relating to intentional homicide in Surat An-Nisa') He said: When the verse "Those who invoke not with Allah any other god, nor slay such life as Allah had made sacred, except for just cause" was revealed, the polytheists of Mecca said: We have killed the soul prohibited by Allah, invoked another god along with Allah for worship, and committed shameful deeds. So Allah revealed the verse "unless he repents, believes, and works righteous deeds, for Allah will change the evil of such persons into good." This is meant for them. As regards the verse "if a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell" He said: If a man knows the command of Islam and intentionally kills a believer, his repentance wil not be accepted. I then mentioned it to Mujahid. He said: "Except the one who is ashamed (of his sin)."
4274 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Sa'id b. Jubair from Ibn 'Abbas through a different chain of narrators. Ibn 'Abbas said:The verse: "Those who invoke not with Allah" applied to polytheists. He said: About them another verse, "Say: O my servants who have transgressed against their souls" was also revealed.
4275 | Ibn 'Abbas said:No other verse has repealed the verse "If a man kills a believer intentionally"
4276 | About the verse "If a man kills a believer intentionally" Abu Mijlaz said:This is his recompense. If Allah wishes to disregard him, He may do do.
4277 | Narrated Sa'id ibn Zayd:      We were with the Prophet (ﷺ). He mentioned civil strife (fitnah) and expressed its gravity. We or the people said: Messenger of Allah, if this happens to us it will destroy us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said; No. It is enough for you that you would be killed. Sa'id said: I saw that my brethren were killed.
4278 | Narrated AbuMusa:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: This people of mine is one to which mercy is shown. It will have no punishment in the next world, but its punishment in this world will be trials, earthquakes and being killed.
4279 | Narrated Jabir ibn Samurah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The religion will continue to be established till there are twelve caliphs over you, and the whole community will agree on each of them. I then heard from the Prophet (ﷺ) some remarks which I could not understand. I asked my father: What is he saying: He said: all of them will belong to Quraysh.
4280 | Narrated Jabir b. Samurah:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: This religion will continue to be strong till the time of twelve caliphs. The people then uttered: Allah is more great and uproared. He then silently a word which I could not understand. So I said to my father: What did he say, father ? He said: All of them will belong to Quraish.
4281 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Jabir b. Samurah through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:When he came back to his home. the Quraish came to him and said: Then what will happen ? He said: Then turmoil will prevail.
4282 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If only one day of this world remained.

Sufyan's version says: The world will not pass away before the Arabs are ruled by a man of my family whose name will be the same as mine.   Abu Dawud said: The version of 'Umar and Abu Bakr is the same as that of Sufyan.
4283 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If only one day of this time (world) remained, Allah would raise up a man from my family who would fill this earth with justice as it has been filled with oppression.
4284 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The Mahdi will be of my family, of the descendants of Fatimah. Abdullah ibn Ja'far said: I heard AbulMalih praising Ali ibn Nufayl and describing his good qualities.

4286 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Disagreement will occur at the death of a caliph and a man of the people of Medina will come flying forth to Mecca. Some of the people of Mecca will come to him, bring him out against his will and swear allegiance to him between the Corner and the Maqam. An expeditionary force will then be sent against him from Syria but will be swallowed up in the desert between Mecca and Medina. When the people see that, the eminent saints of Syria and the best people of Iraq will come to him and swear allegiance to him between the Corner and the Maqam.        Then there will arise a man of Quraysh whose maternal uncles belong to Kalb and send against them an expeditionary force which will be overcome by them, and that is the expedition of Kalb. Disappointed will be the one who does not receive the booty of Kalb. He will divide the property, and will govern the people by the Sunnah of their Prophet (ﷺ) and establish Islam on Earth. He will remain seven years, then die, and the Muslims will pray over him.    Abu Dawud said: Some transmitted from Hisham "nine years" and some "seven years".
4287 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Qatadah through a different chain of narrators. This version has "nine years".   Abu Dawud said:The other narrators mentioned "nine years" from Hisham except Mu'adh.
4288 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Umm Salamah from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators. The tradition of Mu'adh is more perfect.
4289 | Umm salamah reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying about the swallowing up an army by the earth. I asked:How will a man who comes against his will (be swallowed up by the earth), Messenger of Allah ? He replied:  All will be swallowed up, but each will be raised according to his intention on the Day of Resurrection.
4290 | Abu Dawud said:Abu Ishaq told that Ali looked at his son al-Hasan and said: This son of mine is a sayyid (chief) as named by the Prophet (ﷺ), and from his loins will come forth a man who will be called by the name of your Prophet (ﷺ) and resemble him in conduct but not in appearance. He then mentioned the story about his filling the earth with justice.
4290 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:     The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A man called al-Harith ibn Harrath will come forth from Ma Wara an-Nahr. His army will be led by a man called Mansur who will establish or consolidate things for Muhammad's family as Quraysh consolidated them for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Every believer must help him, or he said: respond to his sermons.
4291 | Narrated Abu Hurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Allah will raise for this community at the end of every hundred years the one who will renovate its religion for it.   Abu Dawud said: 'Abd al-Rahman bin Shuriah al-Iskandarani has also transmitted this tradition, but he did not exceed Shrahil.
4292 | Dhu Mikhbar said:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: you will make a secure peace with the Byzantines, then you and they will fight an enemy behind you, and you will be victorious, take booty, and be safe. You will then return and alight in a meadow with mounds and one of the Christians will raise the cross and say: The cross has conquered. One of the Muslims will become angry and smash it, and the Byzantines will act treacherously and prepare for the battle.
4293 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Hassan b. ’Atiyyah through a different chain of narrators. This version add:The Muslims will then make for their weapons and will fight, and Allah will honor that body with martryrdom.    Abu Dawud said: But al-Walid has narrated this tradition from Dhu Mikhbar from the Prophet (ﷺ).   Abu Dawud said: Rawh, Yahya bin Hamzah and Bishr bin Bakr has also transmitted it from al-Awza'i as mentioned by 'Isa.
4294 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The flourishing state of Jerusalem will be when Yathrib is in ruins, the ruined state of Yathrib will be when the great war comes, the outbreak of the great war will be at the conquest of Constantinople and the conquest of Constantinople when the Dajjal (Antichrist) comes forth.

He replied: No, you will be numerous at that time: but you will be scum and rubbish like that carried down by a torrent, and Allah will take fear of you from the breasts of your enemy and last enervation into your hearts.  Someone asked: What is wahn (enervation). Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): He replied: Love of the world and dislike of death.

4303 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (May peace be upon him)  as saying:The last hour will not come before the Muslims fight with the Turks, a people whose faces look as if they were shields covered with skin, and who will wear sandals of hair.

At the end of time the descendants of Qantura' will come with broad faces and small eyes and alight on the bank of the river.

4308 | Salih ibn Dirham said:We went on the pilgrimage and met a man who asked us: Is there a town near you called al-Ubullah?  We said: Yes.

I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: The first of the signs to appear will be the rising of the sun in its place of setting and the coming forth of the beast against mankind in the forenoon. Whichever of them comes first will soon be followed by the other. ’Abd Allah who used to read the scriptures (Torah, Gospel) said: I think the first of them will be the rising of the sun in its place of setting.
4311 | Hudhaifah b. Asid al-Ansari said :We were sitting in the shade of the chamber of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) discussing (something) and when we mentioned the last hour, our voices rose high.

The last of that will be the emergence of a fire from Yemen, from the lowest part of Aden, and drive mankind to their place of assembly.
4312 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:The last hour will not come before rising of the sun in its place of setting. When it rises (there) and the people see it, those who are on it (the earth) will believe.

4313 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:The Euphrates is soon to uncover a treasure of gold, but those who are present must not take any of it.

He will have with him a sea of water and a river of fire, and what you see as fire will be water and what you sea as water will be fire.

Abu Mas’ud al-Badri said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say in this way.
4316 | Anas b. Malik reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:No prophet was sent who had not warned his people about the one-eyed. Between his eyes will be written “infidel” (kafir).

4320 | Narrated Ubadah ibn as-Samit:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I have told you so much about the Dajjal (Antichrist) that I am afraid you may not understand. The Antichrist is short, hen-toed, woolly-haired, one-eyed, an eye-sightless, and neither protruding nor deep-seated. If you are confused about him, know that your Lord is not one-eyed.   Abu Dawud said: 'Amr bin Al-Aswad was appointed a judge.
4321 | Al-nawwas b. Sim’an al-Kilabi said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned the Dajjal (Antichrist)  saying: If he comes forth while I am among you I shall be the one who will dispute with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth when I am not among you, a man must dispute on his own behalf, and Allah will take my place in looking after every Muslim. Those of you who live up to his time should recite over him the opening verses of Surat al – Kahf, for they are your protection from his trial. We asked: How long will he remain on the earth ? He replied : Forty days, one like a year, one like a month, one like a week, and rest of his days like yours. We asked : Messenger of Allah, will one day’s prayer suffice us in this day which will be like a year ? He replied : No, you must make an estimate of its extent. Then Jesus son of Marry will descend at the white minaret to the east of Damascus. He will then catch him up at the date of Ludd and kill him.
4322 | A similar tradition has been transmitted by Abu Umamah from the prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators. In this version he mentioned the prayers to the same effect.

4324 | Narrated Abu Hurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no prophet between me and him, that is, Jesus (ﷺ). He will descent (to the earth). When you see him, recognise him: a man of medium height, reddish fair, wearing two light yellow garments, looking as if drops were falling down from his head though it will not be wet. He will fight the people for the cause of Islam. He will break the cross, kill swine, and abolish jizyah. Allah will perish all religions except Islam. He will destroy the Antichrist and will live on the earth for forty years and then he will die. The Muslims will pray over him.
4325 | Narrated Fatimah, daughter of Qays:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) once delayed the congregational night prayer.        He came out and said: The talk of Tamim ad-Dari detained me. He transmitted it to me from a man who was on of of the islands of the sea. All of a sudden he found a woman who was trailing her hair. He asked: Who are you?        She said: I am the Jassasah. Go to that castle. So I came to it and found a man who was trailing his hair, chained in iron collars, and leaping between Heaven and Earth.        I asked: Who are you?  He replied: I am the Dajjal (Antichrist). Has the Prophet of the unlettered people come forth now?  I replied: Yes.  He said: Have they obeyed him or disobeyed him?  I said: No, they have obeyed him.  He said: That is better for them.
4326 | Fatimah, daughter of Qais, said:I heard the crier of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) calling : Assemble for the prayer. I Then came out and prayed along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit laughing, and he said : Everyone should remain where he had said his prayer. He then asked : Do you know why I have assembled you? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He (ﷺ) said: I did not call you together fors some alarming news or for something good. Rather, I called you all because Tamim al-Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something which agrees with what I was telling you about the Dajjal. He told me that he sailed with thirty men of Lakhm and Judham and that they were storm-tossed for a month. They drew near to an island when the sun was setting. They sat in a boat nearest to them and entered the island where they were met by a very hairy beast. They said: Woe to you! What can you be ? It replied : I am the Jassasah. Go to this man in the monastery, for he is anxious to get news of  you. He said :  When it named a man to us we were afraid of it lest it should be a she-devil. So we went off quickly and entered the monastery, where we found a man with the hugest and strongest frame we had ever seen with his hands chained to his neck. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. He asked them about the palm-trees of Baisan and the spring of Zughar  and about the unlettered prophet. He said: I am the messiah (the Antichrist) and will be soon given permission to emerge. And the Prophet (ﷺ) said: He is in the Syrian sea or the Yemeni sea: No, on the contrary, it is towards the east that he is. He said it twice and pointed his hand to the east. She said: I memorized this (tradition) from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and she narrated the tradition.
4327 | Fatimah, daughter of Qais, said:The prophet (ﷺ) offered the noon prayer and ascended the pulpit. Before this day he did not ascend it except on Friday. He then narrated this story. Abu Dawud said: Ibn Sudran belongs to Basrah. He was drowned in the sea along with Ibn Miswar, and no one could escape except him.
4328 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said one day from the pulpit: When some people were sailing in the sea, their food was finished. An island appeared to them. They went out seeking bread. They were met by the Jassasah (the Antichrist's spy).        I said to AbuSalamah: What is the Jassasah?  He replied: A woman trailing the hair of her skin and of her head.  She said: In this castle. He then narrated the rest of the (No. 4311) tradition. He asked about the palm-trees of Baysan and the spring of Zughar.  He said: He is the Antichrist.  Ibn Salamah said to me: There is something more in this tradition, which I could not remember. He said: Jabir testified that it was he who was Ibn Sayyad.        I said: He died.  He said: Let him die.  I said: He accepted Islam.  He said: Let him accept Islam.  I said: He entered Medina.  He said: Let him enter Medina.
4329 | Ibn ‘Umar said :The prophet (ﷺ) passed by Ibn Sa’Id along with some of his companions. ‘Umar b. al-Kattab was among them. He was playing with boys near the fortress of Banu Maghalah.

Before he was aware,  the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  gave him a pat on the back and said : Do you testify that you are the Messenger of Allah Ibn Sayyad then looked at him and said: I testify that you are the Apostle of Gentiles. Ibn Sayyad then said the prophet (ﷺ) then asked him : What comes to you ? He replied: One who speaks the truth and one who lies come to me. The prophet (may peace upon him) said: You are confused. The Messenger of Allah (may peace upon him) said to him: I have concealed something (in my hand) and he concealed the verse “the day when the sky will bring forth smoke (dukhan) clearly visible Ibn Sayyad said: It is smoke (dukhan) .The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Away with you, You cannot get farther than your rank. ‘Umar said: “Messenger of Allah, permit me to cut off his head. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If he is the one (the Dajjal), you will not be given power over him, and if he is not, you will not do well in killing him.
4330 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Nafi' told that Ibn Umar used to say: I swear by Allah that I do not doubt that Antichrist is Ibn Sayyad.
4331 | Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir told that he saw Jabir ibn Abdullah swearing by Allah that Ibn as-Sa'id was the Dajjal (Antichrist). I expressed my surprise by saying:You swear by Allah! He said: I heard Umar swearing to that in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not make any objection to it.
4332 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      We saw the last of Ibn Sayyad at the battle of the Harrah.
4333 | Narrated Abu Hurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The Last Hour will not come before there come forth thirty Dajjals (fraudulents), everyone presuming himself that he is an apostle of Allah.

4336 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The first defect that permeated Banu Isra'il was that a man (of them) met another man and said: O so-and-so, fear Allah, and abandon what you are doing, for it is not lawful for you. He then met him the next day and that did not prevent him from eating with him, drinking with him and sitting with him. When they did so. Allah mingled their hearts with each other.        He then recited the verse: "curses were pronounced on those among the children of Isra'il who rejected Faith, by the tongue of David and of Jesus the son of Mary"...up to "wrongdoers".        He then said: By no means, I swear by Allah, you must enjoin what is good and prohibit what is evil, prevent the wrongdoer, bend him into conformity with what is right, and restrict him to what is right.
4337 | A similar tradition (to the No. 4322) has also been transmitted by Ibn Mas'ud through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.       This version adds:"Or Allah will mingle your hearts together and curse you as He cursed them."    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by al-Muharibi, from al-'Ala bin al-Musayyab, from 'Abd Allah bin 'Amr bin Murrah, from Salim al-Aftas, from Abu Ubaidah, from 'Abd Allah; and it is been transmitted by Khalid al-Tahhan, from al-'Ala, from 'Amr bin Murrah from Abu 'Ubaidah.
4338 | Narrated Abu Bakr:      You people recite this verse "You who believe, care for yourselves; he who goes astray cannot harm you when you are rightly-guided," and put it in its improper place.       Khalid's version has: We heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: When the people see a wrongdoer and do not prevent him, Allah will soon punish them all. Amr ibn Hushaym's version has: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If acts of disobedience are done among any people and do not change them though the are able to do so, Allah will soon punish them all.   Adu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by Abu Usamah and a group transmitters similar to the version narrated by Khalid. The version of Shu'bah has: "If acts of obedience are done among any people who are more numerous than those who do them...."
4339 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If any man is among a people in whose midst he does acts of disobedience, and, though they are able to make him change (his acts), they do not change, Allah will smite them with punishment before they die.
4340 | Abu sa’Id al-Khudri said:I head the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If any one you sees something objectionable, he should change it with his hand if he can change it with his hand. (The narrator Hammad broke the rest of the tradition which was completed by Ibn al-‘Ala’.) But if he cannot (do so), he should do it with his tongue, and if he cannot (do so with) his tongue he should do it in his heart, that being the weakest form of faith.
4341 | Abu Umayyah ash-Sha'bani said:I asked AbuTha'labah al-Khushani: What is your opinion about the verse "Care for yourselves".        He said: I swear by Allah, I asked the one who was well informed about it; I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it.        He said: No, enjoin one another to do what is good and forbid one another to do what is evil.        But when you see niggardliness being obeyed, passion being followed, worldly interests being preferred, everyone being charmed with his opinion, then care for yourself, and leave alone what people in general are doing; for ahead of you are days which will require endurance, in which showing endurance will be like grasping live coals. The one who acts rightly during that period will have the reward of fifty men who act as he does.        Another version has: He said (The hearers asked:) Messenger of Allah, the reward of fifty of them?        He replied: The reward of fifty of you.
4342 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: How will you do when that time will come? Or he said: A time will soon come when the people are sifted and only dregs of mankind survive and their covenants and guarantees have been impaired and they have disagreed among themselves and become thus, interwining his fingers. They asked: What do you order us to do, Messenger of Allah? He replied: Accept what you approve, abandon what  you disapprove, attend to your own affairs and leave alone the affairs of the generality.   Abu dawud said: A similar tradition has been transmitted by 'Abd Allah bin 'Amr from the Prophet (ﷺ) through different chain.
4343 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      When we were around the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he mentioned the period of commotion (fitnah) saying: When you see the people that their covenants have been impaired, (the fulfilling of) the guarantees becomes rare, and they become thus (interwining his fingers). I then got up and said: What should I do at that time, may Allah make me ransom for you? He replied: Keep to your house, control your tongue, accept what you approve, abandon what you disapprove, attend to your own affairs, and leave alone the affairs of the generality.
4344 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The best fighting (jihad) in the path of Allah is (to speak) a word of justice to an oppressive ruler.
4345 | Narrated Al-'Urs bin 'Amirat al-Kindi:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When sin is done in the earth, he who sees it and disapproves of it will be taken like one who was not present, but he who is not present and approves of it will be like him who sees.
4346 | A similar tradition has also been transmitted by ‘Adl from the prophet (ﷺ) though a different chain of narrators. This version has :He who sees it and disapproves of it will be like him who was not present.
4347 | A man from among the companions of the prophet (ﷺ) reported him as saying:The people will not perish until their sins and faults become abundant, and there remains no excuse for them.
4348 | ‘Abd Allah b.  ‘Umar said :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in the night prayer one night towards the end of his life. When he uttered the salutation, he got up and said : Have you seen this night of yours ? No one of those who are on the surface of the earth will survive at the ends of one hundred years. Ibn ‘Umar said: The people fell into fallacy by this statement of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the traditions they used to narrate concerning one hundred years. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No one of those who are present today on the surface of the earth will survive, meaning when that century comes to and end.
4349 | Narrated Abu Tha'labat al-Khushani:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Allah will not fail to detain this community for less than half a day.
4350 | Narrated Sa'd ibn AbuWaqqas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I hope my community will not fail to maintain their position in the sight of their Lord if He delays them half a day. Sa'd was asked: How long is half a day? He said: It is five hundred years.
4351 | ‘Ikrimah said:‘Ali burned some people who retreated from Islam. When Ibn ‘Abbas was informed of it, he said: If it had been I, I would not have burned them, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do not inflict Allah’s punishment on anyone, but would have had killed them on account of the statement of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Apostle said: Kill those who change their religion. When ‘Ali was informed about it he said: How truly Ibn ‘Abbas said!
4352 | `Abd Allah (b. Mas`ud) reported the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) as saying:The blood of a Muslim man who testifies that there is no god but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah should not be lawfully shed but only for one of three reasons: married fornicator, soul for soul, and one who deserts his religion separating himself from the community.
4353 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) Said:  The blood of a Muslim man who testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Apostle  should not lawfully be shed except only for one of three reasons: a man who committed fornication after marriage, in which case he should be stoned; one who goes forth to fight with Allah and His Apostle, in which case he should be killed or crucified or exiled from the land; or one who commits murder for which he is killed.
4354 | Abu Burdah said on the authority of Abu Musa :I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) while two men who were Ash’ arIs were with me. One of them was on my right and the other on my left side. Bothe of them asked him for employment. The prophet (ﷺ) was silent. He asked : What do you say Abu Musa, or ‘Abd Allah b. Qais (Abu Musa’s name)? I replied: By him who has sent you with truth, they did not inform me of what they had in their hearts, and I did not know that they would ask for an employment. He said  : I have  the scene before my eyes that he had his toothstick below his lip  which receded. He (the prophet) said: We will never or will not put in charge of our work anyone who asks for it. But go, ye, Abu Musa, or ‘Abd Allah b. Qais. He then sent him as a Governor of the Yemen, After him he sent Muadh b. Jabal. When Muadh came to him, he said: come down , and he put a cushion for him.  He saw that a man was chained with him. He asked : What is this? He replied: He was a Jew and he accepted Islam. He then converted to his religion, an evil religion. He said: I will not sit until he is killed according to the decision of Allah and his Apostle (ﷺ). He said: Yes, be seated. He said: I will not sit until he is killed according to the decision of Allah and his Apostle (peace be upon him). He said it three times. He then commanded for it and he was killed. Both of them then discussed the question of prayer and vigilance at night. One of them, probably Muadh, said : So far as I am concerned, I sleep and I keep vigilance: I keep vigilance and I sleep: I hope for the same reward for my sleep as for my vigilance.
4355 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      AbuMusa said: Mu'adh came to me when I was in the Yemen. A man who was Jew embraced Islam and then retreated from Islam. When Mu'adh came, he said: I will not come down from my mount until he is killed. He was then killed. One of them said: He was asked to repent before that.
4356 | Abu Burdah said:A man who turned back from Islam was brought to Abu Musa. He invited him to repent for twenty days or about so. Muadh then came and invited him (to embrace Islam) but he refused. So he was beheaded.
4357 | The tradition mention above has also been transmitted by Abu Musa through a different chain if narrators. But there is no mention of demand of repentance.
4358 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Abdullah ibn AbuSarh used to write (the revelation) for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Satan made him slip, and he joined the infidels. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded to kill him on the day of Conquest (of Mecca). Uthman ibn Affan sought protection for him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave him protection.
4359 | Narrated Sa'd ibn AbuWaqqas:      On the day of the conquest of Mecca, Abdullah ibn Sa'd ibn AbuSarh hid himself with Uthman ibn Affan.        He brought him and made him stand before the Prophet (ﷺ), and said: Accept the allegiance of Abdullah, Messenger of Allah! He raised his head and looked at him three times, refusing him each time, but accepted his allegiance after the third time.        Then turning to his companions, he said: Was not there a wise man among you who would stand up to him when he saw that I had withheld my hand from accepting his allegiance, and kill him?        They said: We did not know what you had in your heart, Messenger of Allah! Why did you not give us a signal with your eye?        He said: It is not advisable for a Prophet to play deceptive tricks with the eyes.
4360 | Jarir reported the prophet (ﷺ) as saying:When a slave runs away and reverts to polytheism, he may lawfully be killed.
4361 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:      A blind man had a slave-mother who used to abuse the Prophet (ﷺ) and disparage him. He forbade her but she did not stop. He rebuked her but she did not give up her habit. One night she began to slander the Prophet (ﷺ) and abuse him. So he took a dagger, placed it on her belly, pressed it, and killed her. A child who came between her legs was smeared with the blood that was there. When the morning came, the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed about it.        He assembled the people and said: I adjure by Allah the man who has done this action and I adjure him by my right to him that he should stand up. Jumping over the necks of the people and trembling the man stood up.        He sat before the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah! I am her master; she used to abuse you and disparage you. I forbade her, but she did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not abandon her habit. I have two sons like pearls from her, and she was my companion. Last night she began to abuse and disparage you. So I took a dagger, put it on her belly and pressed it till I killed her.        Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Oh be witness, no retaliation is payable for her blood.
4362 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      A Jewess used to abuse the Prophet (ﷺ) and disparage him. A man strangled her till she died. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) declared that no recompense was payable for her blood.
4363 | Narrated AbuBakr:      AbuBarzah said: I was with AbuBakr. He became angry at a man and uttered hot words. I said: Do you permit me, Caliph of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), that I cut off his neck? These words of mine removed his anger; he stood and went in. He then sent for me and said: What did you say just now? I said: (I had said:) Permit me that I cut off his neck. He said: Would you do it if I ordered you? I said: Yes. He said: No, I swear by Allah, this is not allowed for any man after Muhammad (ﷺ).    Abu Dawud said: This is Yazid's version. Ahmad bin Hanbal said: That is, Abu Bakr has no powers to slay a man except for three reasons which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had mentioned: disbelief after belief, fornication after marriage, or killing a man without (murdering) any man by him. The Prophet (ﷺ) had powers to kill.
4364 | Anas b. Malik said:Some people of ‘Ukl or ‘Urainah’ came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and found Madinah unhealthy. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered them to go to the camels (of the sadaqah) and ordered them to drink some of their urine and milk. They went there when they became well, they killed the herdsman of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and drove off the camels. The news about them reached the prophet (ﷺ) early in the morning. So he sent people in pursuit of them, and they were brought when they day had risen high. He ordered and their hands and feet were cut off and nails were drawn into their eyes, and they were thrown out of Harrah. They begged for water but were not supplied water. Abu Qilabah said: They were people who had stolen, killed, apostatized after their faith and fought against Allah and his Apostle (ﷺ).
4365 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by the narrator Ayyub through different chain. This version has :So he (the prophet) order nails to be heated and had them blinded with them, and he had their hands and feet cut off, and did not cauterise them to stop the flow of blood.
4366 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Anas. B. Malik through a different chain of narrators. This version says :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent some people who were experts in tracking in pursuit of them and they were brought (to him). Allah , the Exalted, then revealed the verse about it : “ The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and his Apostle and strive for mischief through the land.
4367 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Anas. B. Malik through a different chain of narrators. This version has :Anas said : I saw one of them biting the earth with this mouth (teeth) on account of thirst and this they died.
4368 | A similar tradition has also been transmitted by Anas bin Malik through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:He then forbade disfiguring. This version does not mention the words “ from opposite sides” . This tradition has been narrated by Shu’bah from Qatadah and Salam bin Miskin from Thabit on the authority of Anas. They did not mention the words “from opposite side”. I did not find these words “their hands and feet were cut off from opposite sides”. In any version except in the version of Hammad bin Salamah.
4369 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:      Some people raided the camels of the Prophet (ﷺ), drove them off, and apostatised. They killed the herdsman of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who was a believer. He (the Prophet) sent (people) in pursuit of them and they were caught. He had their hands and feet cut off, and their eyes put out.

4370 | Narrated AbuzZinad:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) cut off (the hands and feet of) those who had stolen his camels and he had their eyes put out by fire (heated nails), Allah reprimanded him on that (action), and Allah, the Exalted, revealed: "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Apostle  and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution or crucifixion."
4371 | Muhammad bin Sirin  said :This happened before the prescribed punishments(hudud) were revealed, meaning the tradition of Anas.
4372 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The verse "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Apostle, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite side or exile from the land...most merciful" was revealed about polytheists. If any of them repents before they are arrested, it does not prevent from inflicting on him the prescribed punishment which he deserves.
4373 | ‘A’ishah said:The Quraish were anxious about the Makhzumi woman who had committed theft, They said : Who will speak to the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) about her ? Then they said: Who will be bold enough for it but Uasmah bin Zaid,  the prophet’s (ﷺ) friend! So Usamah spoke to him, and the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said : Are you interceding regarding one of the punishments prescribed by  Allah ? He then got up and gave an address, saying : What destroyed your predecessors  was just that when a person of rank among them committed a theft, They left him alone , and when a weak one of them committed a theft, they inflicted the prescribed punishment on him . I swear by Allah that if Fatimah daughter of Muhammad should steal, I would have her hand cut off.
4374 | ’A’ishah said:A Makhzumi woman used to borrow goods and deny having received them, so the prophet (ﷺ) gave orders that her hand should be cut off.

Abu dawud said: Ibn Wahb transmitted this tradition from Yunus on the authority of al-Zuhri, and in this version he said al-Laith has said: A woman committed theft during the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ) on the occasion of the Conquest (of Mecca). It has been transmitted by al-Laith from Yunus on the authority of Ibn Shihab through his chain of narrators. He said in this version: A woman borrowed goods. Mas'ud bin al-Aswad also transmitted a similar tradition from the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: A velvet was stolen from the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

4379 | Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:      When a woman went out in the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) for prayer, a man attacked her and overpowered (raped) her.

They went and seized the man  whom they thought had had intercourse with her and brought him to her.        She said: Yes, this is he. Then they brought him to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        When he (the Prophet) was about to pass sentence, the man who (actually) had assaulted her stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, I am the man who did it to her.        He (the Prophet) said to her: Go away, for Allah has forgiven you. But he told the man some good words (AbuDawud said: meaning the man who was seized), and of the man who had had intercourse with her, he said: Stone him to death.       He also said: He has repented to such an extent that if the people of Medina had repented similarly, it would have been accepted from them.    Abu Dawud said: Asbat bin Nasr has also transmitted it from Simak.
4380 | Narrated AbuUmayyah al-Makhzumi:      A thief who had accepted (having committed theft) was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ), but no good were found with him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said to him: I do not think you have stolen. He said: Yes, I have. He repeated it twice or thrice. So he gave orders. His hand was cut off and he was then brought to him. He said: Ask Allah's pardon and turn to Him in repentance. He said: I ask Allah's pardon and turn to Him in repentance. He (the Prophet) then said: O Allah, accept his repentance.   Abu Dawud said: It has been transmitted by 'Amr b. Asim, from Hammam, from Ishaq b. 'Abd Allah from Abu Ummayyah, a man of the Ansar from the Prophet (ﷺ).
4381 | Abu ‘Umamah said :A man came to the prophet (ﷺ) and said : Messenger of Allah ! I have committed a crime which involves prescribed punishment so inflict it on me .

He said : Yes .He then said : Go off, for Allah, the Exalted, forgave you.
4382 | Azhar ibn Abdullah al-Harari said:Some goods of the people of Kila' were stolen. They accused some men of the weavers (of theft). They came to an-Nu'man ibn Bashir, the companion of the Prophet (ﷺ). He confined them for some days and then set them free.        They came to an-Nu'man and said: You have set them free without beating and investigation. An-Nu'man said: What do you want? You want me to beat them. If your goods are found with them, then it is all right; otherwise, I shall take (retaliation) from your back as I have taken from their backs.  They asked: Is this your decision?  He said: This is the decision of Allah and His Apostle (ﷺ).    Abu Dawud said: By this statement he frightened them ; that is, beating is not necessary except after acknowledgement.
4383 | ‘A’ishah said:The prophet (ﷺ) used to cut off a thief’s hand for a quarter of a dinar and upwards.

4388 | Narrated Rafi' ibn Khadij:      Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Hibban said: A slave stole a plant of a palm-tree from the orchard of a man and planted it in the orchard of his master. The owner of the plant went out in search of the plant and he found it. He solicited help against the slave from Marwan ibn al-Hakam who was the Governor of Medina at that time. Marwan confined the slave and intended to cut off his hand. The slave's master went to Rafi' ibn Khadij and asked him about it.        He told him that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: The hand is not to be cut off for taking fruit or the pith of the palm-tree.        The man then said: Marwan has seized my slave and wants to cut off his hand. I wish you to go with me to him and tell him that which you have heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So Rafi' ibn Khadij went with him and came to Marwan ibn al-Hakam.        Rafi' said to him: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: The hand is not to be cut off for taking fruit or the pith of the palm-tree. So Marwan gave orders to release the slave and then he was released.    Abu Dawud said: Kathar means pith of the palm-tree.
4389 | This tradition has also been transmitted by  Muhammad bin Yahya bin Hibban through a different chain of narrators. This version adds :Marwan gave him some lashes and let him go.
4390 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) was asked about fruit which was bung up and said: If a needy person takes some with his mouth and does not take a supply away in his garment, there is nothing on him, but he who carries any of it is to be fined twice the value and punished, and he who steals any of it after it has been put in the place where dates are dried to have his hand cut off if their value reaches the value of a shield. If he steals a thing less in value than it, he is to be find twice the value and punished.    Abu Dawud said: Jarin means the place where dates are dried.

I sell it to him and make the payment of its price a loan ? He said: Why did you not do so before bringing him to me ?     Abu Dawud said: Za'idah has also transmitted it from Simak from Ju'ayd ibn Hujayr. He said: Safwan slept.

Umar has given orders that she should be stoned.        He said: Take her back. He then came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, do you not know that there are three people whose actions are not recorded: a lunatic till he is restored to reason, a sleeper till he awakes, and a boy till he reaches puberty?        He said: Yes.  He then asked: Why is it that this woman is being stoned?        He said: There is nothing.  He then said: Let her go.  He (Umar) let her go and began to utter: Allah is most great.

This version has: Do you not remember that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has said: There are three whose actions are not recorded: a lunatic whose mind is deranged till he is restored to consciousness, a sleeper till he awakes, and a boy till he reaches puberty?
4402 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      AbuZubyan said: A woman who had committed adultery was brought to Umar. He gave orders that she should be stoned.       Ali passed by just then. He seized her and let her go. Umar was informed of it.  He said: Ask Ali to come to me.  Ali came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There are three (people) whose actions are not recorded: A boy till he reaches puberty, a sleeper till he awakes, a lunatic till he is restored to reason. This is an idiot (mad) woman belonging to the family of so and so. Someone might have done this action with her when she suffered the fit of lunacy.        Umar said: I do not know.  Ali said: I do not know.
4403 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There are three (persons) whose actions are not recorded: a sleeper till he awakes, a boy till he reaches puberty, and a lunatic till he comes to reason.    Abu Dawud said: Ibn Juraij has transmitted it from Al-Qasim b. Yazid on the authority of 'Ali from the Prophet (ﷺ). This version adds: "and an old man who is feeble-minded."
4404 | Narrated Atiyyah al-Qurazi:      I was among the captives of Banu Qurayzah. They (the Companions) examined us, and those who had begun to grow hair (pubes) were killed, and those who had not were not killed. I was among those who had not grown hair.
4405 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by ‘Abd al- Malik b. ‘Umar through a different chain of narrators. This version has:They uncovered my private parts, and when they found that the hair had not begun to grow they put me among the captives.
4406 | Ibn ‘Umar said:He was presented before the prophet (ﷺ) on the day of Uhd when he was fourteen years old, but he did not allow him (to participate in the battle). He was again presented before him on the day of Khandaq when he was fifteen years old, Then he allowed him.
4407 | Nafi ‘said:When I mentioned this tradition to ‘Umar.b.’Abd al-Aziz he said : This prescribed punishment is between the minor and the major.
4408 | Narrated Busr ibn Artat:      Junadah ibn AbuUmayyah said: We were with Busr ibn Artat on the sea (on an expedition). A thief called Misdar who had stolen a bukhti she-camel was brought. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Hands are not to be cut off during a warlike expedition. Had it not been so, I would have cut it off.
4409 | Narrated AbuDharr:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: O AbuDharr: I replied: At your service and at your pleasure, Messenger of Allah! He said: how will you do when death smites people, and a house, meaning a grave, will cost as much as a slave. I said: Allah and His Apostle know best, or he said: What Allah and His Apostle choose for me. He said: Show endurance, or he said: You may show endurance.    Abu Dawud said: Hammad b. Abi Sulaiman said: The hand of one who rifles a grave should be cut off because he had entered the deceased's house.
4410 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      A thief was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ).  He said: Kill him.  The people said: He has committed theft, Messenger of Allah!  Then he said: Cut off his hand. So his (right) hand was cut off.  He was brought a second time and he said: Kill him.  The people said: He has committed theft, Messenger of Allah!  Then he said: Cut off his foot.       So his (left) foot was cut off.       He was brought a third time and he said: Kill him.        The people said: He has committed theft, Messenger of Allah!        So he said: Cut off his hand. (So his (left) hand was cut off.)       He was brought a fourth time and he said: Kill him.        The people said: He has committed theft, Messenger of Allah!        So he said: Cut off his foot. So his (right) foot was cut off.       He was brought a fifth time and he said: Kill him.       So we took him away and killed him. We then dragged him and cast him into a well and threw stones over him.
4411 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Muhariz said:  We asked Fadalah b. 'Ubaid about the hanging the (amputated) hand on the neck of a thief whether it was a sunnan. He said: A thief was brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his hand was cut off. Thereafter he commanded for it, and it was hung on his neck.
4412 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:  When a slave steals, sell him, even though it be for half an uqiyah.
4413 | Ibn ‘Abbas said:The Qur’anic verse goes: “If any of your woman are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them, and if they testify, Confine them to houses until death do chain them or Allah ordains for them some (other) way. Allah then mentioned man after woman and combined them in another verse :  “If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, leave them alone. This command was abrogated by the verse relating to flogging : “The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication – flog  each of them with one hundred stripes.
4414 | Mujahid said:“Apponting a way in the verse (iv.15) means prescribed punishment.    Sufiyan said: “Punish them “refers to unmarried, and “confine them to houses” refers to the women who are married.
4415 | ‘Ubadah b. al-Samit reported the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) as sayings:Receive my teachings, receive my teachings. Allah has appointed a way for those women. If the parties have been married, they shall receive a hundred lashes and stoned to death. If the parties are unmarried, they shall receive a hundred lashes and banished for a year.
4416 | A similar tradition has been transmitted by al-Hasan through a chain of Yahya and to the same effect. This version adds:They shall receive a hundred lashes and toned to death.
4417 | Narrated Ubadah ibn as-Samit:      The tradition mentioned above (No. 4401) has also been transmitted by Ubadah ibn as-Samit through a different chain of narrators.        This version has: The people said to Sa'd ibn Ubadah: AbuThabit, the prescribed punishments have been revealed: if you find a man with your wife, what will you do?        He said: I shall strike them with a sword so much that they become silent (i.e. die). Should I go and gather four witnesses? Until that (time) the need would be fulfilled.        So they went away and gathered with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah! did you not see AbuThabit. He said so-and-so.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The sword is a sufficient witness. He then said: No, no, a furious and a jealous man may follow this course.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Waki' from al-Fadl b. Dilham from al-Hasan, from Qabisah b. Huraith, from Salamah b. al-Muhabbaq, from the Prophet (ﷺ). And this is the chain of the tradition narrated by Ibn al-Muhabbaq to the effect that a man had sexual intercourse with a slave girl of his wife.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Fadl b. Dilham was not the memoriser of traditions. He was a butcher in Wasit.
4418 | ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Abbas said:‘Umar b. al-Khattab gave an address saying: Allah sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with truth and sent down the Books of him, and the verse of stoning was included in what He sent down to him. We read it and memorized it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had people stoned to death and we have done it also since his death. I am afraid the people might say with the passage of time: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Books of Allah, and thus they stray by abandoning a duty which Allah had received. Stoning is a duty laid down (by Allah) for married men and women who commit fornication when proof is established, or if there is pregnancy, or a confession. I swear by Allah, had it not been so that the people might say: ‘Umar made an addition to Allah’s Book, I would have written it (there).
4419 | Narrated Nu'aym ibn Huzzal:      Yazid ibn Nu'aym ibn Huzzal, on his father's authority said: Ma'iz ibn Malik was an orphan under the protection of my father. He had illegal sexual intercourse with a slave-girl belonging to a clan. My father said to him: Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and inform him of what you have done, for he may perhaps ask Allah for your forgiveness. His purpose in that was simply a hope that it might be a way of escape for him.        So he went to him and said: Messenger of Allah! I have committed fornication, so inflict on me the punishment ordained by Allah. He (the Prophet) turned away from him, so he came back and said: Messenger of Allah! I have committed fornication, so inflict on me the punishment ordained by Allah. He (again) turned away from him, so he came back and said: Messenger of Allah! I have committed fornication, so inflict on me the punishment ordained by Allah.        When he uttered it four times, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You have said it four times. With whom did you commit it?        He replied: With so and so.  He asked: Did you lie down with her?  He replied: Yes.  He asked: Had your skin been in contact with hers?  He replied. Yes.  He asked: Did you have intercourse with her?  He said: Yes. So he (the Prophet) gave orders that he should be stoned to death. He was then taken out to the Harrah, and while he was being stoned he felt the effect of the stones and could not bear it and fled. But Abdullah ibn Unays encountered him when those who had been stoning him could not catch up with him. He threw the bone of a camel's foreleg at him, which hit him and killed him. They then went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and reported it to him.        He said: Why did you not leave him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been forgiven by Allah.
4420 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      Muhammad ibn Ishaq said: I mentioned the story of Ma'iz ibn Malik to Asim ibn Umar ibn Qatadah.  He said to me: Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn AbuTalib said to me: Some men of the tribe of Aslam whom I do not blame and whom you like have transmitted to me the saying of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Why did you not leave him alone?       He said: But I did not understand this tradition. So I went to Jabir ibn Abdullah and said (to him): Some men of the tribe of Aslam narrate that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said when they mentioned to him the anxiety of Ma'iz when the stones hurt him: "Why did you not leave him alone?' But I do not know this tradition.        He said: My cousin, I know this tradition more than the people. I was one of those who had stoned the man.  When we came out with him, stoned him and he felt the effect of the stones, he cried: O people! return me to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). My people killed me and deceived me; they told me that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would not kill me. We did not keep away from him till we killed him. When we returned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) we informed him of it.        He said: Why did you not leave him alone and bring him to me? and he said this so that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) might ascertain it from him. But he did not say this to abandon the prescribed punishment. He said: I then understood the intent of the tradition.
4421 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Ma'iz ibn Malik came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said that he had committed fornication and he (the Prophet) turned away from him. He repeated it many times, but he (the Prophet) turned away from him. He asked his people: Is he mad? They replied: There is no defect in him. He asked: Have you done it with her? He replied: Yes. so he ordered that he should be stoned to death. He was taken out and stoned to death, and he (the Prophet) did not pray over him.
4422 | Jabir b. Samurah said:I saw Ma’iz b. Malik when he was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ). He was a small and muscular man. He did not wear the loose outer garment. He made confession about him four times that he committed fornication. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Perhaps you kissed her. He said that this most discarded man has committed fornication. He said: So he had him stoned to death and gave an address, saying: Beware, whenever we go out on an expedition in the path of Allah, one of them (I.e. the people) lags behind with a bleating sound like that of a he-goat, and gives modicum of his milk(i.e. sperm) to one of the women. If Allah gives control over any of them, I shall deter him from them (i.e. women) by punishing him severely.
4423 | Simak said:I heard this tradition from Jabir b. Samurah. But the first version is more perfect. This version has: He repeated twice, Simak said: I narrated to Sa’id b. Jubair. He said: He repeated it four times.
4424 | Shu’bah said:I asked Simak about the meaning of KUTHBAH. He said: A small quantity of milk.
4425 | Ibn ‘Abbas said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked Ma’iz b. Malik : Is what I have heard about you is true? He said: What have you heard about me? He said: I have heard that you have had intercourse with a girl belonging to the family of so and so. He said: Yes. He then testified four times. He (The prophet) then gave order regarding him and he was stoned to death.
4426 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      Ma'iz ibn Malik came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and admitted fornication twice. But he drove him away. He then came and admitted fornication twice. But he drove him away. He then came and admitted fornication twice. He (the Prophet) said: You have testified to yourself four times. Take him away and stone him to death.
4427 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Ma'iz ibn Malik: Perhaps you kissed, or squeezed, or looked. He said: No. He then said: Did you have intercourse with her? He said: Yes. On the (reply) he (the Prophet) gave order that he should be stoned to death. The narrator did not mention "on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas". This is Wahb's version.
4428 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      A man of the tribe of Aslam came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and testified four times against himself that he had had illicit intercourse with a woman, while all the time the Prophet (ﷺ) was turning away from him.        Then when he confessed a fifth time, he turned round and asked: Did you have intercourse with her? He replied: Yes.  He asked: Have you done it so that your sexual organ penetrated hers? He replied: Yes.  He asked: Have you done it like a collyrium stick when enclosed in its case and a rope in a well? He replied: Yes. He asked: Do you know what fornication is?  He replied: Yes. I have done with her unlawfully what a man may lawfully do with his wife.        He then asked: What do you want from what you have said?  He said: I want you to purify me. So he gave orders regarding him and he was stoned to death. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) heard one of his companions saying to another: Look at this man whose fault was concealed by Allah but who would not leave the matter alone, so that he was stoned like a dog. He said nothing to them but walked on for a time till he came to the corpse of an ass with its legs in the air.        He asked: Where are so and so?  They said: Here we are, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)!  He said: Go down and eat some of this ass's corpse. They replied: Messenger of Allah! Who can eat any of this?  He said: The dishonour you have just shown to your brother is more serious than eating some of it. By Him in Whose hand my soul is, he is now among the rivers of Paradise and plunging into them.
4429 | A similar tradition has also been transmitted by Abu Hurrairah through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:The narrator Hasan b. “All said: The transmitters have differed in the wordings (of this tradition) reported to me. Some said: He (Ma’iz) was tied to a tree, and others said: He was made to stand.
4430 | Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah said:A man of the tribe of Asalam came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and made confession of fornication. He (the prophet) turned away from him. When he testified against him four times, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Are you mad? He said: No. he asked: Are you married? He replied: Yes. The Prophet (ﷺ) then commanded regarding him and he was stoned in the place of prayer. Then when the stones hurt him, he fled, but was overtaken and stoned to death. The Prophet (ﷺ) then spoke well of him and did not pray over him.
4431 | Abu Sa’id said:When the Prophet (May peace e upon him) commanded to stone Ma’iz b. Malik, we took him out to Baql. I swear by Allah, we did not tie him, nor did we dig a pit for him. But he was standing before us. The narrator Abu Kamil said: So we threw at him bones, clods of mud and pieces of earthenware. He ran away and we ran after him till he came to a side of the Harrah. He stood there before us and we threw at him big stones of the Harrah until he died. He (the Prophet) did not ask forgiveness for him, nor did he speak ill of him.
4432 | Abu Nadrah said:A man came to Prophet (ﷺ). He then mentioned a similar tradition but not completely. This version has: People began to speak ill of him but he (the Prophet) forbade them. Then they began to ask forgiveness from him, but he forbade them by saying. He is a man who had committed a sin. Allah will call him to account himself.
4433 | Buraidah said. :The Prophet (ﷺ) smelt the breath of Ma’iz.
4434 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      We, the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), used to talk mutually: Would that al-Ghamidiyyah and Ma'iz ibn Malik had withdrawn after their confession; or he said: Had they not withdrawn after their confession, he would not have pursued them (for punishment). He had them stoned after the fourth (confession).
4435 | Narrated Al-Lajlaj al-Amiri:      I was working in the market. A woman passed carrying a child. The people rushed towards her, and I also rushed along with them.        I then went to the Prophet (ﷺ) while he was asking: Who is the father of this (child) who is with you? She remained silent.        A young man by her side said: I am his father, Messenger of Allah!        He then turned towards her and asked: Who is the father of this child with you?        The young man said: I am his father, Messenger of Allah! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then looked at some of those who were around him and asked them about him. They said: We only know good (about him).        The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: Are you married?  He said: Yes. So he gave orders regarding him and he was stoned to death.        He (the narrator) said: We took him out, dug a pit for him and put him in it. We then threw stones at him until he died. A man then came asking about the man who was stoned.        We brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: This man has come asking about the wicked man.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He is more agreeable than the fragrance of musk in the eyes of Allah. The man was his father. We then helped him in washing, shrouding and burying him. (The narrator said:) I do not know whether he said or did not say "in praying over him." This is the tradition of Abdah, and it is more accurate.
4436 | A part of tradition has also been transmitted by al-Lajlaj from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators.
4437 | Narrated Sahl ibn Sa'd:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and confessed before him that he had committed fornication with a woman whom he named. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent for the woman and asked her about it. But she denied that she had committed fornication. So he inflicted the prescribed punishment of flogging on him, and let her go.
4438 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      A man committed fornication with a woman. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered regarding him and the prescribed punishment of flogging was inflicted on him. He was then informed that he was married. So he commanded regarding him and he was stoned to death.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Muhammad b. Bakr al-Barsani from Ibn Juraij as a statement of Jabir, and Abu 'Asim has transmitted it from Ibn Juraid similar to that of Ibn Wahb. He did not mention the Prophet (ﷺ). But he said: A man committed fornication, but did not know that he was married ; so he was flogged. It was then known that he was married, so he was stoned to death.
4439 | Jabir said:A man committed fornication with a woman. It was not known that he was married. So he was flogged. It was then known that he was married, so he was stoned to death.
4440 | Narrated Imran ibn Husayn:      A woman belonging to the tribe of Juhaynah (according to the version of Aban) came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said that she had committed fornication and that she was pregnant. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called her guardian.        Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: Be good to her, and when she bears a child, bring her (to me). When she gave birth to the child, he brought her (to him). The Prophet (ﷺ) gave orders regarding her, and her clothes were tied to her. He then commanded regarding her and she was stoned to death. He commanded the people (to pray) and they prayed over her.        Thereupon Umar said: Are you praying over her, Messenger of Allah, when she has committed fornication?        He said: By Him in Whose hand my soul is, she has repented to such an extent that if it were divided among the seventy people of Medina, it would have been enough for them all. And what do you find better than the fact that she gave her life.        Aban did not say in his version: Then her clothes were tied to her.
4441 | Al-Auza’i said:The word shukkta means tied, meaning her clothes were tied on her.
4442 | ) Buraidah said:A woman of Ghamid came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I have committed fornication. He said: Go back. She returned, and on the next day she came to him again, and said: Perhaps you want to send me back as you did to Ma’iz b. Malik. I swear by Allah, I am pregnant. He said to her: Go back. She then returned and came to him the next day. He said to her: Go back until you give birth to a child. She then returned. When she gave birth to a child, she brought the child to him, and said: Here it is! I have given birth to it. He said: Go back, and suckle him until you wean him. When she had weaned him, she brought him (the boy) to him with something in his hand which he was eating. The boy was then given to a certain man of the Muslims and he (the Prophet) commanded regarding her. So a pit was dug for her, and he gave orders about her and she was stoned to death. Khalid was one of those who were throwing stones at her. He threw a stone at her. When a drop blood fell on his cheeks, he abused her. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: Gently, Khalid. By Him in whose hand my soul is, she has reported to such an extent that if one who wrongfully takes extra tax were to repent to a like extent, he would be forgiven. Then giving command regarding her, prayed over her and she was buried.
4443 | Narrated Zakariya Abi 'Imran:     I heard an old man who transmitted from Abu Bakrah on this father's authority that the Prophet (ﷺ) had a woman stoned and a pit was dug up to her breasts.   Abu Dawud said: A man made me understand it from  'Uthman (b. Abi Shaibah)   Abu Dawud said: Al-Ghassani said: Juhainah, Ghamid and Bariq as the same.
4444 | Abu Dawud said:A similar tradition has been transmitted by Zakariya b. Salim through a different chain of narrators. This version adds: He (the Prophet) then threw a pebble like a gram at her. He then said: Throw at her and avoid her face. When se died, he took her out and prayed over her. About repentance he said similar to the tradition on Buraidah.
4445 | Abu Hurairah and Zaid b. Khalid al-Juhani said:Two men brought a dispute before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). One of them said: Pronounce judgement between us in accordance with Allah’s Book, Messenger of Allah! The other who had more understanding said: Yes, Messenger of Allah! Pronounce judgement between us in accordance with Allah’s Book, and allow me to speak. He (the Prophet) said: Speak, He then said: My son who was a hired servant with this(man) committed fornication with his wife, and when I was told that my son must be stoned to death, I ransomed him with a hundred sheep and a slave girl of mine; but when I asked the learned, they told me that my son should receive a hundred lashes and be banished for a year, and that stoning to death applied only to man’s wife. The apostle of Allah (ﷺ) replied: By him in whose hand my soul is, I shall certainly pronounce judgment between you in accordance with Allah’s Book. Your sheep and your slave girl must be returned to you, and your son shall receive a hundred lashes and be banished for a year. And he commanded Unias al-Aslami go to that man’s wife, and if she confessed, he should stone her to death. She confessed and he stoned her.
4446 | Ibn ‘Umar said:some jews came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and mentioned to him that a man and a women of their number had committed fornication. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked them: What do you find in the Torah about stoning? They replied: We disgrace them and they should be flogged. ‘Abd Allah b. Salam said: You lie; it contains (instruction for) stoning. So they brought the Torah and spread it out, and one of them put his hand over the verse of stoning and read what preceded it and what followed it. ‘Abd Allah b. Salam said to him: Lift your hand. When he did so, the verse of stoning was seen to be in it. They then said: He has spoken the truth, Muhammad, the verse of stoning is in it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then gave command regarding them, and they were stoned to death. ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar said: I saw the man leaning on the woman protecting her from the stones.
4447 | Al-Bara’ b. Azib said:The people passed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with a jew whose face blackened with charcoal and he was being taken around. He adjured them by Allah and asked: What is the prescribed punishment for a fornicator in your Divine book? He (the narrator) said: They referred him to a man of them. The Prophet (ﷺ) adjured him and asked: What is the punishment for a fornication in your Divine Book? He replied: Stoning. But fornication spread among our people of rank, so we disliked that a person of rank should be left alone and the punishment be inflicted on one who is lower in rank than him. So we suspended it for us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then commanded regarding him and he was stoned to death. He then said: O Allah! I am the first to give life to a command of Thy Book which they had killed.
4448 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      The people passed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with a Jew who was blackened with charcoal and who was being flogged.        He called them and said: Is this the prescribed punishment for a fornicator?        They said: Yes.  He then called on a learned man among them and asked him: I adjure you by Allah Who revealed the Torah to Moses, do you find this prescribed punishment for a fornicator in your divine Book?        He said: By Allah, no. If you had not adjured me about this, I should not have informed you. We find stoning to be prescribed punishment for a fornicator in our Divine Book. But it (fornication) became frequent in our people of rank; so when we seized a person of rank, we left him alone, and when we seized a weak person, we inflicted the prescribed punishment on him. So we said: Come, let us agree on something which may be enforced equally on people of higher and lower rank. So we agreed to blacken the face of a criminal with charcoal, and flog him, and we abandoned stoning.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: O Allah, I am the first to give life to Thy command which they have killed. So he commanded regarding him (the Jew) and he was stoned to death.        Allah Most High then sent down: "O Apostle, let not those who race one another into unbelief, make thee grieve..." up to "They say: If you are given this, take it, but if not, beware!...." up to "And if any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) unbelievers," about Jews, up to "And if any do fail to judge by (the right of) what Allah hath revealed, they are no better than) wrong-doers" about Jews: and revealed the verses up to "And if any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel." About this he said: This whole verse was revealed about the infidels.
4449 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Umar:      A group of Jews came and invited the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to Quff. So he visited them in their school.        They said: AbulQasim, one of our men has committed fornication with a woman; so pronounce judgment upon them.  They placed a cushion for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who sat on it and said: Bring the Torah. It was then brought. He then withdrew the cushion from beneath him and placed the Torah on it saying: I believed in thee and in Him Who revealed thee.       He then said: Bring me one who is learned among you. Then a young man was brought. The transmitter then mentioned the rest of the tradition of stoning similar to the one transmitted by Malik from Nafi'(No. 4431).
4450 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      (This is Ma'mar's version which is more accurate.) A man and a woman of the Jews committed fornication.        Some of them said to the others: Let us go to this Prophet, for he has been sent with an easy law. If he gives a judgment lighter than stoning, we shall accept it, and argue about it with Allah, saying: It is a judgment of one of your prophets. So they came to the Prophet (ﷺ) who was sitting in the mosque among his companions.        They said: AbulQasim, what do you think about a man and a woman who committed fornication? He did not speak to them a word till he went to their school.        He stood at the gate and said: I adjure you by Allah Who revealed the Torah to Moses, what (punishment) do you find in the Torah for a person who commits fornication, if he is married?        They said: He shall be blackened with charcoal, taken round a donkey among the people, and flogged. A young man among them kept silent.        When the Prophet (ﷺ) emphatically adjured him, he said: By Allah, since you have adjured us (we inform you that) we find stoning in the Torah (is the punishment for fornication).        The Prophet (ﷺ) said: So when did you lessen the severity of Allah's command? He said:        A relative of one of our kings had committed fornication, but his stoning was suspended. Then a man of a family of common people committed fornication. He was to have been stoned, but his people intervened and said: Our man shall not be stoned until you bring your man and stone him. So they made a compromise on this punishment between them.        The Prophet (ﷺ) said: So I decide in accordance with what the Torah says. He then commanded regarding them and they were stoned to death.        Az-Zuhri said: We have been informed that this verse was revealed about them: "It was We Who revealed the Law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the Prophet who bowed (as in Islam) to Allah's will.
4451 | Abu Hurairah said:A man and a woman of the Jews who were married committed fornication at the time when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to Medina. Stoning was a prescribed punishment for them in accordance with the Torah, but they abandoned it and followed tajbiyyah, meaning, the man was beaten a hundred times with a rope painted with tar and was seated on a donkey with his face towards the tail of the donkey. Their rabbis then assembled and sent some people to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). They said to them: Ask him about the prescribed punishment for fornication. The transmitter then mentioned the rest of the tradition. They version adds: They were not the followers of his religion, and he (the prophet) was to pronounce judgment between them. So he was given a choice in this verse:”If they do come to thee, either judge between them, or decline to interfere.
4452 | Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah said:The Jews brought a man and a woman of them who had committed fornication. He said: Bring me two learned men or yours. So they brought the two sons of Suriya. He adjured them and said: How do you think about the matter if these two persons bear witness to the effect that they have seen his sexual organ in her female organ (penetrated) like a collyrium stick when enclosed in its case, they will be stoned to death. He asked: What is there which prevents you from stoning them: They replied : Our rule has gone, so we disapproved of killing. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then called four witnesses. They brought four witnesses. Who testified that they had seen his sexual organ (penetrated) in her female organ like a collyrium stick when enclosed in its case. The Prophet (ﷺ) then gave orders for stoning them.
4453 | A similar tradition has also been transmitted by Ibrahim and al-Sha’bi from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators. But this version does not mention the words:He called the witnesses who testified.
4454 | A similar tradition has also been transmitted by al-Sha’bi through a different chain of narrators.
4455 | Jabir bin ‘Abd Allah said:The Prophet (ﷺ) had a man and a woman of the Jews who had committed fornication stoned to death.
4456 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      while I was wandering in search of my camels which had strayed, a caravan or some horsemen carrying a standard came forward. The bedouin began to go round me for my position with the Prophet (ﷺ). They came to a domed structure, took out a man from it, and struck his neck. I asked about him. They told me that he had married his father's wife.
4457 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      I met my uncle who was carrying a standard. I asked him: Where are you going? He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has sent me to a man who has married his father's wife. He has ordered me to cut off his head and take his property.
4458 | Narrated An-Nu'man ibn Bashir:      Habib ibn Salim said: A man called AbdurRahman ibn Hunayn had intercourse with his wife's slave-girl. The matter was brought to an-Nu'man ibn Bashir who was the Governor of Kufah. He said: I shall decide between you in accordance with the decision of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). If she made her lawful for you, I shall flog you one hundred lashes. If she did not make her lawful for you, I shall stone you to death. So they found that she had made her lawful for him. He, therefore, flogged him one hundred lashes.   Qatadah said: I wrote to Habib b. Salim; so he wrote this (tradition) to me.
4459 | Narrated An-Nu'man ibn Bashir:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: about a man who had (unlawful) intercourse with his wife's slave girl: If she made her lawful for him, he will be flogged one hundred lashes; if she did not make her lawful for him, I shall stone him.
4460 | Narrated Salamah ibn al-Muhabbaq:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a decision about a man who had intercourse with his wife's slave-girl as follows. If he forced her, she is free, and he shall give her mistress a slave-girl similar to her; if she asked him to have intercourse voluntarily, she will belong to him, and he shall give her mistress a slave-girl similar to her.    Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Yunus b. 'Ubaid, 'Amr b. Dinar, Mansur b. Zadhan and Salam from al-Hasan to the same effect. But yunus and Mansur did not mention Qabisah.
4461 | Narrated Salamah ibn al-Muhabbaq:      A similar tradition (to the No. 4445) has also been transmitted by Salamah ibn al-Muhabbaq from the Prophet (ﷺ).       This version has: If she asked her to have intercourse with her voluntarily, then she and a similar slave-girl would be given to her mistress from his property.
4462 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If you find anyone doing as Lot's people did, kill the one who does it, and the one to whom it is done.   Abu Dawud said: A similar tradition has also been transmitted by Sulaiman b. Bilal from 'Amr b. Abi 'Umar. And 'Abbad b. Mansur transmitted it from 'Ikrimah on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas who transmitted it from the Prophet (ﷺ). It has also been transmitted by Ibn Juraij from Ibrahim from Dawud b. Al-Husain from 'Ikrimah on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas who transmitted it from the Prophet (ﷺ).
4463 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      If a man who is not married is seized committing sodomy, he will be stoned to death.    Abu Dawud said: The tradition of 'Asim proved the tradition of 'Amir b. Abi 'Amr as weak.
4464 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone has sexual intercourse with an animal, kill him and kill it along with him. I (Ikrimah) said: I asked him (Ibn Abbas): What offence can be attributed to the animal/ He replied: I think he (the Prophet) disapproved of its flesh being eaten when such a thing had been done to it.   Abu Dawud said: This is not a strong tradition.
4465 | 'Asim reported from Abu Razin on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas saying:There is no prescribed punishment for one who has sexual intercourse with an animal.   Abu Dawud said: 'Ata is also so. Al Hakam said: I think he should be flogged, but the number should not reach the one of the prescribed punishment. Al-Hasan said: He is like a fornicator.   Abu Dawud said: THe tradition of 'Asim proves the tradition of 'Amr b. Abi 'Amr as weak.
4466 | Narrated Sahl ibn Sa'd:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and made acknowledgment before him that he had committed fornication with a woman whom he named. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent someone to the woman and he asked her about it. She denied that she had committed fornication. So he gave him the prescribed punishment of lashes and left her.
4467 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A man of Bakr ibn Layth came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and made confession four times that he had committed fornication with a woman, so he had a hundred lashes administered to him. The man had not been married. He then asked him to produce proof against the woman, and she said: I swear by Allah, Messenger of Allah, that he has lied. Then he was given the punishment of eighty lashes of falsehood.
4468 | ‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) said:A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I contacted directly a women at the furthest part of the city (i.e., Medina), and I did with her everything except sexual intercourse. So here I am; inflict any punishment you wish. Thereupon ‘Umar said: Allah has concealed your fault; it would have been better if you also had concealed it yourself. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent a men after him. (When he came) he recited the verse: “And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night. . .” up to the end of the verse. A man from the people got up and asked: Is it particular to him, Messenger of Allah, or for the people in general? He replied: It is all the people.
4469 | Abu Hurairah and Zaid b. Khalid al-Juhani said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked about a slave-woman who commits fornication, and she is not married: If she commits fornication, flog her: if she commits fornication again flog her; if only for a rope of hair (dafir).   Ibn Shihab: I do not know whether he (the Prophet) said it is a third or a fourth time.
4470 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:When the slave-woman of any of you commits fornication, he should inflict the prescribed punishment on her, but not hurl reproaches at her. This is to be done up to three times. If she a fourth time, he should flog her, and sell her even if only for a rope of hair.
4471 | This tradition has been transmitted by Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ). This version has:He said each time: He should give her the appropriate beating according to Allah’s Book, but not Hurl reproaches at her. He said a fourth time: If she does it again, he should give her the appropriate beating according to Allah’s Book, and then should sell her even if only for a rope of hair.
4472 | Narrated Abu Umamah b. Sahl Hunaif:      AbuUmamah ibn Sahl ibn Hunayf said that some companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told that one of their men suffered so much from some illness that he pined away until he was skin and bone (i.e. only a skeleton). A slave-girl of someone visited him, and he was cheered by her and had unlawful intercourse with her. When his people came to visit the patient, he told them about it.        He said: Ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the legal verdict for me, for I have had unlawful intercourse with a slave-girl who visited me.        So they mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: We have never seen anyone (so weak) from illness as he is. If we bring him to you, his bones will disintegrate. He is only skin and bone. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded them to take one hundred twigs and strike him once.
4473 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      A slave-girl belonging to the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) committed fornication. He (the Prophet) said: Rush up, Ali, and inflict the prescribed punishment on her. I then hurried up, and saw that blood was flowing from her, and did not stop. So I came to him and he said: Have you finished inflicting (punishment on her)? I said: I went to her while her blood was flowing. He said: Leave her alone till her bleeding stops; then inflict the prescribed punishment on her. And inflict the prescribed punishment on those whom your right hands possess (i.e. slaves).    Abu Dawud said: A similar tradition has been transmitted by Abu al-Ahwas from 'Abd al-A'la, and also by Shu'bah from 'Abd al-A'la. This version has: He said: Do not give her beating until she gives birth to a child. But the former (version) is sounder.
4474 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      When my vindication came down, the Prophet (ﷺ) mounted the pulpit and mentioned that, and recited the Qur'an. Then when he came down from the pulpit he ordered regarding the two men and the woman, and they were given the prescribed punishment.
4475 | The tradition mentioned above (No. 4459) has also been transmitted by Muhammad ibn Ishaq through a different chain of narrators. But he did not mention Aisha.       This version has:He (the Prophet) commanded regarding the two men and the woman who spoke obscenity were Hassan ibn Thabit and Mistah ibn Uthathah. An-Nufayl said: It is said that the woman was Hammah daughter of Jahsh.
4476 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) did not prescribe any punishment for drinking wine. Ibn Abbas said: A man who had drunk wine and become intoxicated was found staggering on the road, so he was taken to the Prophet (ﷺ). When he was opposite al-Abbas's house, he escaped, and going in to al-Abbas, he grasped hold of him. When that was mentioned to the Prophet (ﷺ), he laughed and said: Did he do that? and he gave no command regarding him.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition of al-Hasan b. 'Ali has been transmitted only by the people of Medina.
4477 | Abu Hurairah said:When a man who had drunk wine was brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he said: Beat him. Abu Hurairah said: Some struck him with their hands, some with their garment. When he turned his face, some people said: Allah put you shame! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do not say like that and help the devil to get power over him.
4478 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Ibn al- Had through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. He said after the word “beating”:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said to his Companions:  Reproach him, and they faced him and said: You have not respected Allah, you have not feared Allah and you have not shown shame before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then they released him. Some have also added similar words.
4479 | Anas b. Malik said:The Prophet (ﷺ) gave a beating with palm-branches and sandals for drinking wine and Abu Bakr gave lashes. When ‘Umar came to power, he called upon people and said to them: The people are living now near watering placing, and, according to Musaddad’s version, “near villages and watering places, so what do you say about the punishment for (drinking) wine? ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awf said: We think that you should prescribe the lightest punishment. So he fixed eight lashes for it.   Abu Dawud said: It has also been transmitted by Ibn Al 'Arubah from Qatadah from the Prophet (ﷺ) to the effect that he gave a beating forty times with palm branches and sandals. And Shu'bah narrated it from Qatadah on the authority of Anas from Prophet (ﷺ). This version has: He gave a beating with two palm-branches about forty times.
4480 | Hudayn ibn al-Mundhir ar-Ruqashi, who was AbuSasan, said:I was present with Uthman ibn Affan when al-Walid ibn Uqbah was brought to him. Humran and another man bore witness against him (for drinking wine). One of them testified that he had seen him drinking wine, and the other testified that he had seen him vomiting it.        Uthman said: He could not vomit it, unless he did not drink it. He said to Ali: Inflict the prescribed punishment on him. Ali said to al-Hasan: Inflict the prescribed punishment on him.        Al-Hasan said: He who has enjoyed its pleasure should also bear its burden.  So Ali said to Abdullah ibn Ja'far: Inflict the prescribed punishment on him. He took a whip and struck him with it while Ali was counting.        When he reached (struck) forty (lashes), he said: It is sufficient. The Prophet (ﷺ) gave forty lashes. I think he also said: "And AbuBakr gave forty lashes, and Uthman eighty. This is all sunnah (standard practice). And this is dearer to me."
4481 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and AbuBakr gave forty lashes for drinking wine and Umar made it eighty. And all this is sunnah, the model and standard practice.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Asma'i explaning the maxim, "He who enjoys its cold should bear its heat," said: He who enjoys the easy if it should also take the responsibility of the hard of it.   Abu Dawud said: Hudain b. al-Mundhir Abu Sasan was the leader of his tribe.
4482 | Narrated Mu'awiyah ibn AbuSufyan:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If they (the people) drink wine, flog them, again if they drink it, flog them. Again if they drink it, kill them.
4483 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Ibn ‘Umar through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version has :I think he said for the fifth time: If he drinks it, kill him.   Abu Dawud said: And similarly the word “a fifth time” occurs in the tradition of Abu Ghutaif.
4484 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If he is intoxicated, flog him; again if he is intoxicated, flog him; again if he is intoxicated, flog him if he does it again a fourth time, kill him.       Abu Dawud said: And there is a similar tradition of Umar ibn AbuSalamah, from his father, on the authority of AbuHurayrah, from the Prophet (ﷺ): If he drinks wine, flog him if he does it so again, a fourth time, kill him.  Abu Dawud said: And there is similar tradition of Suhail from Abu Salih on the authority of Abu Hurairah, from the Prophet (ﷺ): It they drink a fourth time, kill them. And there is similar tradition of Ibn Abi Nu'm on the authority of Ibn 'Umar from Prophet (ﷺ). There is also similar tradition of 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr from the Prophet (ﷺ), and from Sharid from the Prophet (ﷺ). And in the tradition of al-Jadli from Mu'awiyah, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: If he does so again third or fourth time, kill him.
4485 | Narrated Qabisah ibn Dhuwayb:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone drinks wine, flog him; if he repeats it, flog him, and if he repeats it, flog him. If he does it again a third or a fourth time, kill him. A man who had drunk wine was brought (to him) and he gave him lashes. He was again brought to him, and he flogged him. He was again brought to him and he flogged him. He was again brought to him and he flogged him. The punishment of killing (for drinking) was  repealed, and a concession was allowed.   Sufyan said: Al-Zuhri transmitted this tradition when Mansur b. al-Mu'tamir amd Mukhawwal b. Rashid were present with him. He said to them: Take this tradition as a present to the people of Iraq.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by al-Sharid b. Suwaid, Sharahbil b. Aws, 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr, 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar, Abu Ghutaif al-Kindi, and Abu Salamah b. 'Abd al-Rahman from Abu Hurairah.
4486 | ’Ali said:I shall not pay blood-money or (he said) : I am not going to pay blood-money for him on whom I inflicted the prescribed punishment except for the one who drank wine, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not prescribe anything definite. It is a thing which we have decided (by agreement) ourselves.
4487 | Narrated AbdurRahman ibn Azhar:      I can still picture myself looking at the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who was among the camps of the Companions seeking the camp of Khalid ibn al-Walid, when a man who had drunk wine was brought before him. He asked the people: Beat him. Some struck him with sandals, some with sticks and some with fresh branches of the palm-tree (mitakhah). Ibn Wahb said: This (mitakhah) means green palm fronds. Then the apostle of Allah (ﷺ) took some dust from the ground and threw it on his face.
4488 | Narrated AbdurRahman ibn al-Azhar:      A man who had drunk wine was brought before the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was in Hunayn. He threw some dust on his face. He then ordered his Companions and they beat him with their sandals and whatever they had in their hands. He then said to them: Leave him,  and they left him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then died, and AbuBakr gave forty lashes for drinking wine, and then Umar in the beginning of his Caliphate inflicted forty stripes and at the end of his Caliphate he inflicted eighty stripes. Uthman (after him) inflicted both punishments, eighty and forty stripes, and finally Mu'awiyah established eighty stripes.
4489 | Narrated AbdurRahman ibn Azhar:      I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the morning of the conquest of Mecca when I was a young boy. He was walking among the people, seeking the camp of Khalid ibn al-Walid. A man who had drunk wine was brought (before him) and he ordered them (to beat him). So they beat him with what they had in their hands. Some struck him with whips, some with sticks and some with sandals. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) threw some dust on his face.        When a man who had drunk wine was brought before AbuBakr, he asked them (i.e. the people) about the number of beatings which they gave him. They numbered it forty. So AbuBakr gave him forty lashes.        When Umar came to power, Khalid ibn al-Walid wrote to him: The people have become addicted to drinking wine and they look down upon the prescribed punishment and its penalty.        He said: They are with you, ask them. The immigrants who embraced Islam in the beginning were with him. He asked them and they agreed on the fact that (a drunkard) should be given eighty lashes.        Ali said: When a man drinks wine, he tells lies. I, therefore, think that he should be prescribed punishment that is prescribed for telling lies..   Abu Dawud said: 'Uqail b. Khalid included in the chain of this tradition: "Abd Allah b. Abd al-Rahman b. al-Azhar from his father" between al-Zuhri and Ibn al-Azhar.
4490 | Narrated Hakim ibn Hizam:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade to take retaliation in the mosque, to recite verses in it and to inflict the prescribed punishments in it.
4491 | Abu Burdah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:No more than ten lashes are to be given, except in the case of one of the punishment prescribed by Allah, the Exalted.
4492 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Abu Burdah al-Ansari through a different chain of narrators. This version has:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say. . . He then mentioned the tradition to the same effect.
4493 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When one of you inflicts a beating, he should avoid striking the face.
4494 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:      Qurayzah and Nadir (were two Jewish tribes). An-Nadir were nobler than Qurayzah. When a man of Qurayzah killed a man of an-Nadir, he would be killed. But if a man of an-Nadir killed a man of Qurayzah, a hundred wasq of dates would be paid as blood-money. When Prophethood was bestowed upon the Prophet (ﷺ), a man of an-Nadir killed a man of Qurayzah.        They said: Give him to us, we shall kill him.  They replied: We have the Prophet (ﷺ) between you and us. So they came to him.        Thereupon the following verse was revealed: "If thou judge, judge in equity between them." "In equity" means life for a life.        The following verse was then revealed: "Do they seek of a judgment of (the days) ignorance?"    Abu Dawud said: Quraizah and al-Nadir were the descendants of Harun the Prophet (peace be upon him)
4495 | Narrated AbuRimthah:      I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) with my father. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then asked my father: Is this your son? He replied: Yes, by the Lord of the Ka'bah. He again said: Is it true? He said: I bear witness to it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then smiled for my resemblance with my father, and for the fact that my father took an oath upon me. He then said: He will not bring evil on you, nor will you bring evil on him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited  the verse: "No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another."
4496 | Narrated AbuShurayh al-Khuza'i:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If a relative of anyone is killed, or if he suffers khabl, which means a wound, he may choose one of the three things: he may retaliate, or forgive, or receive compensation. But if he wishes a fourth (i.e. something more), hold his hands. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty.
4497 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      I never saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that some dispute which involved retaliation was brought to him but he commanded regarding it for remission.
4498 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      A man was killed in the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ). The matter was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ). He entrusted him to the legal guardian of the slain. The slayer said: Messenger of Allah, I swear by Allah, I did not intend to kill him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to the legal guardian: Now if he is true and you kill him, you will enter Hell-fire. So he let him go. His hands were tied with a strap. He came out pulling his strap. Hence he was called Dhu an-Nis'ah (possessor of strap).
4499 | Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:      I was with the Prophet (ﷺ) when a man who was a murderer and had a strap round his neck was brought to him.        He then called the legal guardian of the victim and asked him: Do you forgive him?        He said: No.  He asked: Will you accept the blood-money?  He said: No.  He asked: Will you kill him?  He said: Yes.  He said: Take him. When he turned his back, he said: Do you forgive him?  He said: No.  He said: Will you accept the blood-money?  He said: No.  He said: Will you kill him?  He said: Yes.  He said: Take him. After repeating all this a fourth time, he said: If you forgive him, he will bear the burden of his own sin and the sin of the victim. He then forgave him.  He (the narrator) said: I saw him pulling the strap.
4500 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by 'Alqamah b. Wa'il through a different chain of narrators and to the same effect.
4501 | Narrated Wa'il (b. Hujr):A man brought an Abyssinian to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: This man has killed my nephew. He asked: How did you kill him? He replied: I struck his head with axe but I did not intend to kill him. He asked: Have you some money so that you pay his blood-wit? He said: No. He said: What is your opinion if I send you so that you ask the people (for money) and thus collect your blood-wit? He said: No. He asked : Will your masters give you his blood-wit (to pay his relatives)? He said: No. He said to the man. Take him. So he brought him out to kill him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If he kill him, he will be like him. This (statement) reached the man where he was listening to his statement. He said: He is here, order regarding him as you like. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Leave him alone. And he once said: He will bear the burden of the sin of the slain and that of his own and thus he will become one of the Companions of Hell. So he let him go.
4502 | Narrated AbuUmamah ibn Sahl:      We were with Uthman when he was besieged in the house. There was an entrance to the house. He who entered it heard the speech of those who were in the Bilat. Uthman then entered it. He came out to us, looking pale.        He said: They are threatening to kill me now.  We said: Allah will be sufficient for you against them, Commander of the Faithful!  He asked: Why kill me? I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: It is not lawful to kill a man who is a Muslim except for one of the three reasons: Kufr (disbelief) after accepting Islam, fornication after marriage, or wrongfully killing someone, for which he may be killed.       I swear by Allah, I have not committed fornication before or after the coming of Islam, nor did I ever want another religion for me instead of my religion since Allah gave guidance to me, nor have I killed anyone. So for what reason do you want to kill me?    Abu Dawud said: 'Uthman and Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with them) abandoned drinking wine in pre-Islamic times.
4503 | Narrated Ziyad ibn Sa'd ibn Dumayrah as-Sulami:      On the authority of his father (Sa'd) and his grandfather (Dumayrah) (according to Musa's version) who were present in the battle of Hunayn with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): After the advent of Islam, Muhallam ibn Jaththamah al-Laythi killed a man of Ashja'.       That was the first blood-money decided by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (for payment). Uyaynah spoke about the killing of al-Ashja'i, for he belonged to Ghatafan, and al-Aqra' ibn Habis spoke on behalf of Muhallam, for he belonged to Khunduf. The voices rose high, and the dispute and noise grew.        So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you not accept blood-money, Uyaynah?        Uyaynah then said: No, I swear by Allah, until I cause his women to suffer the same fighting and grief as he caused my women to suffer. Again the voices rose high, and the dispute and noise grew.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you not accept the blood-money Uyaynah? Uyaynah gave the same reply as before, and a man of Banu Layth called Mukaytil stood up. He had a weapon and a skin shield in his hand.        He said: I do not find in the beginning of Islam any illustration for what he has done except the one that "some sheep came on, and those in the front were shot; hence those in the rear ran away". (The other example is that) "make a law today and change it."        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Fifty (camels) here immediately and fifty when we return to Medina. This happened during some of his journeys. Muhallam was a tall man of dark complexion. He was with the people. They continued (to make effort for him) until he was released. He sat before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), with his eyes flowing.        He said: Messenger of Allah! I have done (the act) of which you have been informed. I repent to Allah, the Exalted, so ask Allah's forgiveness for me. Messenger of Allah!        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: Did you kill him with your weapon at the beginning of Islam. O Allah! do not forgive Muhallam. He said these words loudly.        AbuSalamah added: He (Muhallam) then got up while he was wiping his tears with the end of his garment.        Ibn Ishaq said: His people alleged that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked forgiveness for him after that.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Nadr b. Shumail said: al-ghiyar means blood-wit.
4504 | Narrated AbuShurayb al-Ka'bi:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Then you, Khuza'ah, have killed this man of Hudhayl, but I will pay his blood-wit. After these words of mine if a man of anyone is killed, his people will have a choice to accept blood-wit or to kill him.
4505 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:When Mecca was conquered, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up and said: If a relative of anyone is killed, he will have a choice between two : he (the slayer) will either pay the blood-wit or he will be killed. A man of the Yemen called Abu Shah stood up and said: Write for me, Messenger of Allah. The narrator al-'Abbas (b. al-Walid) said: Write to me, (you people). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write (you people), for Abu Shah. These are the wordings of the tradition of Ahmad.   Abu Dawud said: Write (you people), for me, that is, the address of the Prophet (ﷺ).
4506 | Narrated 'Amr b. Shu'aib:     On his father's authority said that his grandfather reported the Prophet (ﷺ) said: A believer will not be killed for an infidel. If anyone kills a man deliberately, he is to be handed over to the relatives of the one who has been killed. If they wish, they may kill, but if they wish, they may accept blood-wit
4507 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I will not forgive anyone who kills after accepting blood-wit
4508 | Narrated Anas bin Malik:A Jewess brought a poisoned sheep to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he ate of it. She was then brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who asked her about it. She said: I intended to kill you. He said: Allah will not give you control over it ; or he said : over me. They (the Companions) said: Should we not kill her ? He said: No. He (Anas) said: I always found it in the uvula of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)
4509 | Narrated Abu Hurairah: A Jewess presented a poisoned sheep to the Prophet (ﷺ), but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not interfere with he.   Abu Dawud said: The Jewess who poisoned the Prophet (ﷺ) was sister of Marhab.
4510 | Narrated Ibn Shihab:      Jabir ibn Abdullah used to say that a Jewess from the inhabitants of Khaybar poisoned a roasted sheep and presented it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who took its foreleg and ate from it. A group of his companions also ate with him.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: Take your hands away (from the food). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then sent someone to the Jewess and he called her.        He said to her: Have you poisoned this sheep?  The Jewess replied: Who has informed you? He said: This foreleg which I have in my hand has informed me.  She said: Yes.  He said: What did you intend by it?  She said: I thought if you were a prophet, it would not harm you; if you were not a prophet, we should rid ourselves of him (i.e. the Prophet). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then forgave her, and did not punish her. But some of his companions who ate it, died. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had himself cupped on his shoulder on account of that which he had eaten from the sheep. AbuHind cupped him with the horn and knife. He was a client of Banu Bayadah from the Ansar.
4511 | Narrated AbuSalamah:      A Jewess presented a roasted sheep to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at Khaybar.       He then mentioned the rest of the tradition like that of Jabir (No. 4495). He said: Then Bashir ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died. He sent someone to call on the Jewess, and said to her (when she came): What motivated you to do the work you have done?  He then mentioned the rest of the tradition similar to the one mentioned by Jabir (No. 4495).       The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then ordered regarding her and she was killed. But he (AbuSalamah) did not mention the matter of cupping.
4512 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:  The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would accept a present, but would not accept alms (sadaqah). And Wahb bin Baqiyyah narrated to us, elsewhere, from Khalid, from Muhammad ibn Amr said on the authority of AbuSalamah, and he did not mention the name of Abu Hurairah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to accept presents but not alms (sadaqah).        This version adds: So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ate of it and the people also ate.        He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died.        So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done?        She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should  rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then ordered regarding her and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.
4513 | Narrated Ibn Ka'b b. Malik:      On the authority of his father: Umm Mubashshir said to the Prophet (ﷺ) during the sickness of which he died: What do you think about your illness, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaybar. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: And I do not think about my illness except that. This is the time when it cut off my aorta.   Abu Dawud said: Sometime 'Abd al-Razzaq transmitted this tradition, omitting the link of the Companion, from Ma'mar, from al-Zuhri, from the Prophet (ﷺ), and sometimes he transmitted it from al-Zuhri from 'Abd al-Rahman b. Ka'b b. Malik, 'Abd al-Rahman mentioned that Ma'mar sometimes transmitted the tradition in a mursal form (omitting the link of the Companion), and they recorded it. And all this is correct with us. 'Abd al-Razzaq said: When Ibn al-Mubarak came to Ma'mar, he transmitted the traditions in a musnad form (with a perfect chain) which he transmitted as mauquf traditions (statements of the Companions and not of the Prophet).
4514 | Narrated 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Abd Allah b. Ka'b b. Malik :On the authority of his mother than Umm Mubashshir said (Abu Sa'id b. al-A'rabi said: So he said it on the authority of his mother ; what is correct is: on the authority of his father, instead of his mother): I entered upon the Prophet (ﷺ). He then mentioned the tradition of Makhlad b. Khalid in a way similar to the tradition of Jabir. The narrator said: Then Bishr b. al-Bara' b. Ma'rur died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess and said: What did motivate you for your work you have done ? He (the narrator) then mentioned the rest of the tradition like the tradition of Jabir. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered regarding her and she was killed. He (the narrator in this version) did not mention cupping.
4515 | Narrated Samurah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) Said: If anyone kills his slave, we shall kill him, and if anyone cuts off the nose of his slave, we shall cut off his nose.
4516 | Narrated Qatadah: Through the same chain of narrators as mentioned before, i.e. Samurah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: If anyone castrates his slave, we shall castrate him. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition like that of Sh'ubah and Hammad.   Abu Dawud said: Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi transmitted it from Hisham like the tradition of Mu'adh.
4517 | Qatadah transmitted the tradition mentioned above through a chain of narrators like that of Shu'bah. This version adds:Then al-Hasan forgot this tradition, and he used to say: A free man is not to be killed for a slave.
4518 | It was narrated from Hisham, from Qatadah, from Al-Hasan, who said:"A free man should not be subjected to retaliation in return for a slave."
4519 | Narrated 'Amr b. Shu'aib:     On his father's authority, said that his grandfather told that a A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) crying for help. He said: His slave-girl, Messenger of Allah! He said: Woe to you, what happened with you ? He said that it was an evil one. He saw the slave-girl of his master; he became jealous of him, and cut off his penis. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Bring the man to me. The man was called, but people could not get control over him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: Go away, you are free. He asked: Messenger of Allah! upon whom does my help lie? He replied: On every believer, or he said: On every Muslim.   Abu Dawud said: The name of the man who was emancipated was Rawh b. Dinar   Abu Dawud said: The man who cut off the penis was Zinba'   Abu Dawud said: The Zinba' Abu Rawh was master of the slave.
4520 | Narrated Sahl b. Abi Hathmah and Rafi' b. Khadij: Muhayyasah b. Mas'ud and 'Abd Allah b. Sahl came to Khaibar and parted (from each other) among palm trees. 'Abd Allah b. Sahl was killed. The Jews were blamed (for the murder). 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl and Huwayyasah and Muhayyasah, the sons of his uncle (Mas'ud) came to the Prophet (ﷺ). 'Abd al-Rahman, who was the youngest, spoke about his brother, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: (Respect) the elder, (respect) the elder or he said: Let the eldest begin. They then spoke about their friend and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Fifty of you should take oaths regarding a man from them (the Jews) and he should be entrusted (to him) with his rope (in his neck). They said: It is a matter which we did not see. How can we take oaths ? He said: The Jews exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them. They said: Messenger of Allah! they are a people who are infidels. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) paid them bloodwit himself. Sahl said: Once I entered the resting place of their camels, and the she-camel struck me with her lef. Hammad said this or (something) similar to it.   Abu Dawud said: Another version transmitted by Yahya b. Sa'id has: Would you swear fifty oaths and make you claim regarding your friend or your slain man ? Bishr, the transmitter, did mention blood. 'Abdah transmitted it from Yahya as transmitted by Hammad. Ibn 'Uyainah has also transmitted it from Yahya, and began with his words: The Jew will exonerate themselves by fifty oaths which they will swear. He did not mention the claim.   Abu Dawud said: This is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn 'Uyainah.
4521 | Sahl b. Abi Hathmah and some senior men of the tribe told that 'Abd Allah b. Abi Sahl and Muhayyasah came to Khaibar on account of the calamity (i.e. famine) that befall them. Muhayyasah came and told the 'Abd Allah b. Sahl had been killed and thrown in a well or stream. He hen came to the Jews and said:I swear by Allah, you have killed him. They said: We swear by Allah, we have not killed him. He then proceeded and came to his tribe  and mentioned this to them. Then he, his brother Huwayyasah, who was older to him, and 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl came forward (to the Prophet). Muhayyasah began to speak. It was he who was at Khaibar. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said to him: Let the eldest (speak), let the eldest (speak), meaning age. So Huwayyasah spoke, and after him Muhayyasah spoke. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: They should either pay the bloodwit for you friend or they should be prepared for war. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote to them about it. They wrote (in reply): We swear by Allah, we have not killed him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said to Huwayyasah, Muhayyasah and 'Abd al-Rahman: Will you take an oath and thus have the claim to the blood of your friend ? They said: No. He (the Prophet) said: The Jews will then take an oath. They said: They are not Muslims. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) himself paid the bloodwit. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then sent on one hundred she-camels and they were entered in their house. Sahl said: A red she-camel of them gave me a kick.
4522 | Narrated 'Amr b. Shu'aib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) killed a man of Banu Nadr ibn Malik at Harrah ar-Righa' at the bank of Layyat al-Bahrah. The transmitter Mahmud (ibn Khalid) also mentioned the words along with the words "at Bahrah" "the slayer and the slain were from among them". Mahmud alone transmitted in this tradition the words "at the bank of Layyah".
4523 | Narrated Bashir b. Yasar:That a man of the Ansar called Sahl b. Abi Hathmah told him that some people of his tribe went to Khaibar and separated there. They found one of them slain. They said to those with whom they had found him: You have killed our friend. They replied: We did not kill him, nor do we know the slayer. We (the people of the slain) then went to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ). He said to them: Bring proof against the one who has slain him. They replied: We have no proof. He said: Then they will take an oath for you. They said: We do not accept the oaths of the Jews. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not like no responsibility should be fixed for his blood. So he himself paid his bloodwit consisting of one hundred camels of sadaqah (i.e. camels sent to the Prophet as zakat).
4524 | Narrated Rafi' ibn Khadij:      A man of the Ansar was killed at Khaybar and his relatives went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. He asked: Have you two witnesses who can testify to the murderer of your friend? They replied: Messenger of Allah! there was not a single Muslim present, but only Jews who sometimes have the audacity to do even greater crimes than this. He said: Then choose fifty of them and demand that they take an oath; but they refused and the Prophet (ﷺ) paid the blood-wit himself.
4525 | Narrated 'Abd al-Rahman b. Bujaid:I swear by Allah, Sahl had a misunderstanding about this tradition. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote to the Jews: A slain man has been found amongnst you, so pay his bloodwit. They wrote (to him): Swearing by Allah fifty oaths, we neither killed him nor do we know his slayer. He said: Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) himself paid his bloodwit which consisted of one hundred she-camels.
4526 | Narrated 'Abu Salamah b. 'Abd al-Rahman and Sulaiman b. Yasar:      On the authority of some men of the Ansar : The Prophet (ﷺ) said to the Jews and started with them: Fifty of you should take the oaths. But they refused (to take the oaths). He then said to the Ansar: Prove your claim. They said: Do we take the oaths without seeing, Messenger of Allah? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then imposed the blood-wit on the Jews because he (the slain) was found among them.
4527 | Narrated Anas:A girl was found with her head crushed between two stones. She was asked: Who has done this to you ? Is it so and so ? Is it so and so, until a Jew was named, and she gave a sign with her head. The Jew was caught ad he admitted. So the Prophet (ﷺ) gave command that his head should be crushed with stones.
4528 | Narrated Anas: A Jew killed a girl of the Ansar for her ornaments. He then threw her in a well, and crushed her head with stones. He was then arrested and brought to the Prophet (ﷺ). He ordered regarding him that he should be stoned to death. He was then stoned till he died.   Abu Dawud said: It has been transmitted by Ibn Juraij from Ayyub in a similar way.
4529 | Narrated Anas:A girl was wearing silver ornaments. A Jew crushed her head with a stone. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered upon her when she had some breath. He said to her: Who has killed you ? Had so and so killed you ? She replied: No, making a sign with her head. He again asked: Who has killed you ? Has so and so killed you ? She replied: No, making a sign with her head. He again asked: Has so and so killed you ? She said: Yes, making sign with her head. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded regarding him, and he was killed between two stones.
4530 | Narrated Qays ibn Abbad :      I and Ashtar went to Ali and said to him: Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) give you any instruction about anything for which he did not give any instruction to the people in general?        He said: No, except what is contained in this document of mine. Musaddad said: He then took out a document. Ahmad said: A document from the sheath of his sword.        It contained: The lives of all Muslims are equal; they are one hand against others; the lowliest of them can guarantee their protection. Beware, a Muslim must not be killed for an infidel, nor must one who has been given a covenant be killed while his covenant holds. If anyone introduces an innovation, he will be responsible for it. If anyone introduces an innovation or gives shelter to a man who introduces an innovation (in religion), he is cursed by Allah, by His angels, and by all the people.       Musaddad said: Ibn AbuUrubah's version has: He took out a document.
4531 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, mentioning the tradition similar to the one transmitted by Ali. This version adds: The most distant of them gives protection as from all, those who are strong among them send back (spoil) to those who are weak among them, and their expeditions sending it back to those who are at home.
4532 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:That Sa'd b. 'Ubadah said: Messenger of Allah! If a man finds a man with his wife, should he kill him ? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No. Sa'd : Why not, by Him who has honoured you with truth ? The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Listen to what your chief is saying. The narrator 'Abd al-Wahhab said: (Listen) to what Sa'd is saying.
4533 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:That Sa'd b. 'Ubadah said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) : What do you think if I find with my wife a man ; should I give him some time until I bring four witnesses ?" He said: "Yes".
4534 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) sent AbuJahm ibn Hudhayfah as a collector of zakat. A man quarrelled with him about his sadaqah (i.e. zakat), and AbuJahm struck him and wounded his head. His people came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Revenge, Messenger of Allah!        The Prophet (ﷺ) said: You may have so much and so much. But they did not agree. He again said: You may have so much and so much. But they did not agree. He again said: You may have so much and so much. So they agreed.        The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I am going to address the people in the afternoon and tell them about your consent.        They said: Yes.  Addressing (the people), the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: These people of faith came to me asking for revenge. I presented them with so much and so much and they agreed. Do you agree?        They said: No. The immigrants (muhajirun) intended (to take revenge) on them. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded them to refrain and they refrained.        He then called them and increased (the amount), and asked: Do you agree?  They replied: Yes.  He said: I am going to address the people and tell them about your consent.  They said: Yes.  The Prophet (ﷺ) addressed and said: Do you agree?  They said: Yes.
4535 | Narrated Anas:A girl was found with her head crushed between two stoned. She was asked: Who did it with you ? Was it so and so ? Was it so and so ? Until the Jew was named. Thereupon she gave a sign with her head. The Jew was arrested and he admitted. So the Prophet (ﷺ) gave command that his head should be crushed with stones.
4536 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was distributing something, a man came towards him and bent down on him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) struck him with a bough and his face was wounded. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: Come and take retaliation. He said: no, I have forgiven, Messenger of Allah!.
4537 | Narrated Abu Firas:      'Umar b. al-Khattab (ra) addressed us and said: I did not send my collectors (of zakat) so that they strike your bodies and that they take your property. If that is done with someone and he appeals to me, I shall take retaliation on him. Amr ibn al-'As said: If any man (i.e. governor) inflicts disciplinary punishment on his subjects, would you take retaliation on him too? He said: Yes, by Him in Whose hand my soul is, I shall take retaliation on him. I saw that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has given retaliation on himself.
4538 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) Said: The disputants should refrain from taking retaliation. The one who is nearer should forgive first and then the one who is next to him, even if (the one who forgives) were a woman.   Abu Dawud said: I have been informed that forgiving by women in the case of murder is permissible if a woman were one of the heirs (of the slain). I have been told on the authority of Abu 'Ubaid about the meaning of the word yanhajizu, that is, they should refrain from retaliation.
4539 | Tawus, in his version said:If anyone is killed. Ibn 'Ubaid in his version said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If anyone is killed in error (blindly) when people are throwing stones, or by beating with whips, or striking with a stick, it is accidental and the compensation for accidental death is due. But if anyone is killed deliberately, retaliation is due. Ibn 'Ubaid in his version: Retaliation of the man is due. The agreed version then goes: If anyone comes in (between the two parties) to prevent it, Allah's curse and anger will rest on him, and neither supererogatory nor obligatory acts will be accepted from him. The version of the tradition of Sufyan is more perfect.
4540 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: He then mentioned the rest of the tradition to the same effect as mentioned by Sufyan.
4541 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported the  Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that if anyone is killed accidentally, his blood-wit should be one hundred camels: thirty she-camels which had entered their second year, thirty she-camels which had entered their third year, thirty she-camels which had entered their fourth year, and ten male camels which had entered their third year.
4542 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported that the  value of the blood-money at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was eight hundred dinars or eight thousand dirhams, and the blood-money for the people of the Book was half of that for Muslims.        He said: This applied till Umar (Allah be pleased with him) became caliph and he made a speech in which he said: Take note! Camels have become dear. So Umar fixed the value for those who possessed gold at one thousand dinars, for those who possessed silver at twelve thousand (dirhams), for those who possessed cattle at two hundred cows, for those who possessed sheep at two thousand sheep, and for those who possessed suits of clothing at two hundred suits. He left the blood-money for dhimmis (protected people) as it was, not raising it in proportion to the increase he made in the blood-wit.
4543 | Narrated Ata' ibn AbuRabah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that blood-wit for those who possessed camels should be one hundred camels, and for those who possessed cattle two hundred cows, and for those who possessed sheep  one thousand sheep, and for those who possessed suits of clothing two hundred suits, and for those who possessed wheat something which the narrator Muhammad (ibn Ishaq) did not remember.
4544 | Abu Dawud said:I read out to Sa'id b. Ya'qub al-Taliqini who said: Abu Tumailah transmitted to us, saying: Muhammad b. Ishaq transmitted to us saying: 'Ata reported Jabir b. 'Abd Allah as saying: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fixed; and he mentioned the tradition like that of Musa; he said: And those who possess corn food should pay something which I do not remember.
4545 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The blood-wit for accidental killing should be twenty she-camels which had entered their fourth year, twenty she-camels which had entered their fifth year, twenty she-camels which had entered their second year, twenty she-camels which had entered their third year, and twenty male camels which had entered their second year. It does not beyond Ibn Mas'ud.
4546 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A man of Banu Adi was killed. The Prophet (ﷺ) fixed his blood-wit at the rate of twelve thousand (dirhams).    Abu Dawud said: Ibn 'Uyainah transmitted it from 'Amr, from 'Ikrimah, from the Prophet (ﷺ), and he did not mention Ibn 'Abbas.
4547 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr:      (Musaddad's version has): The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a speech on the day of the conquest of Mecca, and said: Allah is Most Great, three times. He then said: There is no god but Allah alone: He fulfilled His promise, helped His servant, and alone defeated the companies.       (The narrator said:) I have remembered from Musaddad up to this.       Then the agreed version has: Take note! All the merits mentioned in pre-Islamic times, and the claim made for blood or property are under my feet, except the supply of water to the pilgrims and the custody of the Ka'bah. He then said: The blood-money for unintentional murder which appears intentional, such as is done with a whip and a stick, is one hundred camels, forty of which are pregnant. Musaddad's version is more accurate.
4548 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Khalid through the same chain of narrators to the same effect.
4549 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ) to the same effect. This version has:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed on the day of Conquest, or he said: On the conquest of Mecca on the ladder of the House or of the Ka'bah.   Abu Dawud said: In a similar way of Ibn 'Uyainah also transmitted it from 'Ali b. Zaid, from al-Qasim b. Rab'iah, from Ibn 'Umar, from the Prophet (ﷺ) ; and Ayyub al-Sukhtiyani transmitted it from al-Qasim b. Rabi'ah from 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr like the tradition of Khalid. Hammad b. Salamah also transmitted it from 'Ali b. Zaid, from Ya'qub al-Sadusi, on the authority of 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr from the Prophet (ﷺ). The statements of Zaid and of Abu Musa are similar to the tradition of the Prophet (ﷺ) and to the tradition of 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him.)
4550 | Narrated Mujahid:'Umar gave judgement that bloodwit for quasi-intentional murder should be thirty she-camels in their fourth year, thirty she-camels in their fifth  year, and forty pregnant she-camels in their sixth year up to the ninth
4551 | Narrated 'Abd Allah (b. Mas'ud):The bloodwit for unintentional murder which resembles intentional is twenty-five she camels which entered their fourth year, twenty five she-camels which had entered their fifth year, twenty five she-camels which had entered their third year, and twenty five camels which had entered their second year.
4552 | Narrated 'Ali:The bloodwit for unintentional murder is in four parts: twenty five she-camels in their fourth year, twenty five she-camels in their fifth year, twenty five she-camels in their third year, and twenty twenty five she-camels in their second year.
4553 | Narrated 'Uthman b. 'Affan and Zaid b. Thabit:The bloodwit for what resembled intentional murder should be forty pregnant she-camels in their fifth year, thirty she-camels in their fourth year, and thirty she-camels in their third year. The bloodwit for unintentional murder is thirty she-camels in their fourth year, thirty she-camels in their third year, and twenty she-camels in their second year.
4554 | Narrated Zaid b. Thabit:About the bloodwit for quasi-intentional murder..... He then mentioned a similar tradition as mentioned above.
4555 | Narrated Abu Dawud: Abu Dawud and others have said: When a she-camel enters fourth year, the female is called hiqqah, and the male is called hiqq, for it deserves that it should be loaded and ridden. When a camel enters its fifth year, the male is called Jadha' and the female is called Jadha'ah. When it enters its sixth year, and sheds its front teeth, it is called thani (male) and thaniyyah (female). When it enters its seventh year, it is called raba' and raba'iyyah. When it enters its ninth year and cuts its canine teeth, it is called bazil. When it enters its tenth year, it is called mukhlif. Then there is no name for it, but is called bazil'am and bazil'amain, and mukhlif'am and mukhlif'amain, upto any year it increases. Nad d. Shumail said: Bint makhad is a she-camel of one year, and bin labun is s she-camel of two years, hiqqah is a she-camel of three years, jadha'ah is a she-camel of four years, thani is a camel of five years, raba' is a camel of six years, sadis is a camel of seven years, and bazil is a camel of eight years.   Abu Dawud said: Abu Hatim and al-Asma'i said: Al-Jadhu'ah is a time when no tooth is growing. Abu Hatim said: Some of them said: When it sheds its teeth between front and canine teeth, it is called raba' and when it sheds its front teeth, it is called thani. Abu 'Ubaid said: When it becomes pregnant, it is called khalifah, and it remains khalifah for ten months; when it reaches ten months, it is called 'ushara', Abu Hatim said: When it shed its front teeth, it is called thani and when it sheds its teeth between front and canine teeth it is called raba'.
4556 | Narrated AbuMusa:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The fingers are equal: ten camels for each finger.
4557 | Narrated AbuMusa al-Ash'ari:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The fingers are equal. I asked: Ten camels for each? He replied: Yes.     Abu Dawud said: Muhammad b. Ja'far transmitted it from Shu'bah, from Ghalib, saying: I heard Masruq b. Aws ; and Isma'il transmitted it, saying: Ghalib al-Tammar transmitted it to me through the chain of Abu al-Walid ; and Hanzlah b. Abi Safiyyah transmitted it from Ghalib through the chain of Isma'il.
4558 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: This and that are equal, that is, the thumb and the little finger.
4559 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The fingers are equal and the teeth are equal. The front tooth and the molar tooth are equal, this and that are equal.    Abu Dawud said: Nadr b. Shumail transmitted it from Shu'bah to the same effect as mentioned by 'Abd al-Samad. Abu Dawud said: al-Darimi narrated it to me from al-Nadr.
4560 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The teeth are equal, and the fingers are equal.
4561 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) treated the fingers and toes as equal.
4562 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather said: The Prophet (ﷺ) said in his address while he was leaning against the Ka'bah: (The blood-wit) for each finger is ten camels.
4563 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather said: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: For each tooth are ten camels.
4564 | Narrated Abu Dawud:   I found in my notebook from Shaiban and I did not hear from him ; Abu Bakr, a reliable friend of ours, said: Shaiban - Muhammad b. Rashid - Sulaiman b. Musad - 'Amr b. Suh'aib, On his father's authority, said that his grandfather said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would fix the blood-money for accidental killing at the rate of four hundred dinars or their equivalent in silver for townsmen, and he would fix it according to the price of camels. So when they were dear, he increased the amount to be paid, and when cheap prices prevailed he reduced the amount to be paid. In the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) they reached between four hundred and eight hundred dinars, their equivalent in silver being eight thousand dirhams.        He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that those who possessed cattle should pay two hundred cows, and those who possessed sheep two thousand sheep.        He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The blood-money is to be treated as something to be inherited by the heirs of the one who has been killed, and the remainder should be divided among the agnates.        He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that for cutting off a nose completely there was full blood-money, one hundred (camels) were to be paid. If the tip of the nose was cut off, half of the blood-money,i.e. fifty camels were to be paid, or their equivalent in gold or in silver, or a hundred cows, or one thousand sheep. For the hand, when it was cut of,f half of the blood-money was to be paid; for one foot of half, the blood-money was to be paid. For a wound in the head, a third of the blood-money was due, i.e. thirty-three camels and a third of the blood-money, or their equivalent in gold, silver, cows or sheep. For a head thrust which reaches the body, the same blood-money was to be paid. Ten camels were to be paid for every finger, and five camels for every tooth.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that the blood-money for a woman should be divided among her relatives on her father's side, who did not inherit anything from her except the residence of her heirs. If she was killed, her blood-money should be distributed among her heirs, and they would have the right of taking revenge on the murderer.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is nothing for the murderer; and if he (the victim) has no heir, his heir will be the one who is nearest to him among the people, but the murderer should not inherit anything.        Muhammad said: All this has been transmitted to me by Sulayman ibn Musa on the authority of Amr ibn Shu'aib who, on his father's authority, said that his grandfather heard it from the Prophet (ﷺ).   Abu Dawud said: Muhammad b. Rashid, an inhabitant of Damascus, fled from Basrah escaping murder.
4565 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Blood-wit for what resembles intentional murder is to be made as severe as that for intentional murder, but the culprit is not to be killed. Khalid gave us some additional information on the authority of Ibn Rashid: That (unintentional murder which resembles intentional murder) means that Satan jumps among the people and then the blood is shed blindly without any malice and weapon.
4566 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Blood-wit for every wound which lays bare a bone is five camels.
4567 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that a third of the blood-wit should be paid for an eye fixed in its place.
4568 | Narrated Al-Mughirah b. Shu'bah:A man of Hudhail has two wives. One of them struck her fellow-wife with a tent-pole and killed her and her unborn child. They brought the dispute to the Prophet (ﷺ). One of two men said: How can we pay bloodwit for the one who did not make a noise, or ate, nor drank, nor raised his voice ? He (the Prophet) asked: Is it rhymed prose like that of bedouin? He gave judgement that a male or female slave of the best quality should be paid in compensation, and he fixed it to be paid by woman's relatives on her father's side.
4569 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Mansur through a different chain of narrators and to the same effect. This version adds:The Prophet (ﷺ) fixed the bloodwit for the slain woman to be paid by the relatives of the woman who had slain her, on the father's side.   Abu Dawud said: In a similar way it has been transmitted by al-Hakam from Mujahid from al-Mughirah.
4570 | Narrated Al-Miswar b. Makhramah:  'Umar consulted the people about the compensation of abortion of woman. Al-Mughirah b. Shu'bah said: I was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he gave judgement that a male or female slave should testify you. So he brought Muhammad b. Maslamah to him. Harun added: He then testified him.   Imlas means a man striking the belly of his wife.   Abu Dawud said: I have been informed that Abu 'Ubaid said: It (abortion) is called imlas because the woman causes it to slip before the time of delivery. Similarly, anything which slips from the hand or from some other thing is called malasa (slipped).
4571 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by 'Umar through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.   Abu Dawud said:Hammad b. Zaid and Hammad b. Salamah transmitted it from Hisham b. 'Arubah on his father's authority who said that 'Umar said...
4572 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: 'Umar asked about the decision of the Prophet (ﷺ) about that (i.e. abortion). Haml b. Malik b. al-Nabhigah got up and said: I was between two women. One of them struck another with a rolling-pin killing both her and what was in her womb. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgement that the bloodwit for the unborn child should be a male or a female slave of the best quality and the she should be killed.   Abu Dawud said: Al-Nadr b. Shumail said: Mistah means a rolling-pin.   Abu Dawud said: Abu 'Ubaid said: Mistah means a pole from the tent-poles.
4573 | Narrated Tawus:      Umar stood on the pulpit. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition to the same effect as mentioned before. He did not mention "that she should be killed". This version adds: "a male or a female slave". Umar then said: Allah is Most Great. Had I not heard it, we would have decided about it something else.
4574 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      About the story of Haml ibn Malik, Ibn Abbas said: She aborted a child who had grown hair and was dead, and the woman also died. He (the Prophet) gave judgment that the blood-wit was to be paid by the woman's relatives on the father's side. Her uncle said: Messenger of Allah! She has aborted a child who had grown hair. The father of the woman who had slain said: He is a liar: I swear by Allah, he did not raise his voice, or drink or eat. No compensation is to be paid for an offence like this. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: is it a rhymed prose of pre-Islamic Arabia and its soothsaying? Pay a male or female slave of the best quality in compensation for the child.   Ibn 'Abbas said: The name of one of them was Mulaikah, and the name of the other was Umm Ghutaif.
4575 | Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:      One of the two women of Hudhayl killed the other, Each of them had husband and sons. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fixed the blood-wit for the slain woman to be paid by the woman's relatives on the father's side. He declared her husband and the child innocent. The relatives of the woman who killed said: We shall inherit from her. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No, her sons and her husband should inherit from her.
4576 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:Two women of Hudhail fought together and one of them threw a stone at the other and killed her. They brought their dispute to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who gave judgement that a male or female slave of the best quality should be given as compensation for her unborn child, and he fixed it to be paid by the woman's relatives on the father's side. He made her sons and those who were with them her heirs. Hamal b. Malik b. al-Nabighah al-Hudhali said: Messenger of Allah ! how should I be fined for one who has not drunk, or eaten or spoken, or raised his voice? - adding that compensation is not to be paid for such (an offense). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This man simply belong to the soothsayers on account of his rhymed prose which he has used.
4577 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:About this story: Then the woman, against whom he decided that a male or female should be paid for her, died. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then gave judgement that her sons will inherit from her, and the bloodwit should be paid by her relatives on the father's side.
4578 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      A woman threw a stone at another woman and she aborted. The dispute was brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He gave judgment that five hundred sheep should be paid for her (unborn) child, and forbade throwing stones.    Abu Dawud said: The version of this tradition goes in this way, i.e. five hundred sheep. What is correct is one hundred sheep. Abu Dawud said: 'Abbas transmitted this tradition this way, but it is misunderstanding.
4579 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that a male or a female slave, or a horse or a mule should be paid for a miscarriage.    Abu Dawud said: Hammad b. Salamah and Khalid b. 'Abd Allah transmitted this tradition from Muhammad b. 'Amr, but they did not mention "or a horse or a mule"
4580 | Narrated Al-Sha'bi: The price of a male or a female slave is five hundred dirhams.   Abu Dawud said: Rabi'ah said: The price of a male or a female slave is fifty dinars.
4581 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment about the slave who had made an agreement to purchase his freedom (mukatab) and he had been killed that blood-wit is paid for him at the rate paid for a free man so far as he has paid the purchase money, and at the rate paid for a slave as the remainder is concerned.
4582 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When a mukatab (a slave who has made an agreement to purchase his freedom) gifts blood-money or an inheritance, he can inherit in accordance with the extent to which he has been emancipated.    Abu Dawud said: Wuhaib transmitted it from Ayyub, from 'Ikrimah, on the authority of 'Ali, from the Prophet (ﷺ): and Hammad b. Zaid and Isma'il have transmitted it in a mursal form (i.e the link of the Companion being missing) from Ayyub, from 'Ikrimah, from the Prophet (ﷺ). Isma'il b. 'Ulayyah has treated it as a statement of 'Ikrimah.
4583 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:      On his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: The blood-wit for a man who makes a covenant is half of the blood-wit for a free man.   Abu Dawud said: It has been transmitted by Usamah b. Zaid al-Laithi and 'Abd al-Rahman b. al-Harith on the authority of 'Amr b. Suh'aib in similar manner.
4584 | Narrated Safwan b. Ya'la:On this father's authority, said: A servant of mine fought with a man and bit his hand and he drew away his hand. (One of) his front teeth fell out. So he came to the Prophet (ﷺ) who imposed no retaliation for his tooth, saying: Do you intend that he leaves his hand in your mouth so that you crunch it like a male camel ? He said: Ibn Abi Mulaikah told me on the authority of his grandfather that Abu Bakr (ra) imposed no retaliation on him for it, saying: May his tooth go away!
4585 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Ya'la b. Umayyah through a different chain of narrators. This version has:The Prophet (ﷺ) said to the man bit him: If you wish that you give him control over your hand and he bites it, and then you drive it away from his mouth (you may do it). He imposed no retaliation for his teeth.
4586 | Narrated 'Amr b. Suh'aib:     On his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Anyone who practises medicine when he is not known as a practitioner will be held responsible.   Abu Dawud said: This has been transmitted by al-Walid alone. We do not know whether it is sound or not.
4587 | Narrated AbdulAziz ibn Umar ibn AbdulAziz:      Some people of the deputation which came to my father reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Any physician who practises medicine when he was not known as a practitioner before that and he harms (the patients) he will be held responsible. AbdulAziz said: Here physician does not refer to a man by qualification. it means opening a vein, incision and cauterisation.
4588 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Musaddad's version has: He addressed on the day of Conquest. The agreed version then goes: Beware! Every object of pride of pre-Islamic times, whether it is blood-vengeance or property, mentioned or claimed, has been put under my feet except supply of water to the pilgrims and custody of the House (the Ka'bah). He then said: Beware! The blood-wit for unintentional murder, such as is done with a whip and stick, is one hundred camels, forty of which are pregnant.
4589 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Khalid with a different chain of narrators to the same effect.
4590 | Narrated Imran ibn Husayn:      A servant of some poor people cut off the ear of the servant of some rich people. His people came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah! we are poor people. So he imposed no compensation on them.
4591 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone is killed blindly or, when people are throwing stones, by a stone or a whip, his blood-wit is the blood-wit for an accidental murder. But if anyone is killed intentionally, retaliation is due. If anyone tries to prevent it, the curse of Allah, of angels, and of all the people will rest on him.
4592 | Narrated Abu Hurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: No recompense is to be demanded if one is kicked by an animal.   Abu Dawud said: An animal kicks someone with its leg while one is riding on it.
4593 | Narrated Abu Hurairah:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: No retaliation is payable for a wound caused by a dumb animal, for a mine, and for a well. On the treasure found buried in the land there is a fifth.  Abu Dawud said: A dumb animal means an animal which is free and has not tether, and there is no one (as a watchman) with it. It causes harm by day and not by night.
4594 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: No recompense may be demanded if the fire spreads.
4595 | Narrated Anas bin Malik:Al-Rubayyi', sister of Anas b. al-Nadr, broke (one of) the front teeth of a woman. They came to the Prophet (ﷺ). He made a decision in accordance with the Book of Allah that retaliation should be taken. Anas b. al-Nadr said: I swear by Him who has sent you the truth, her front tooth will not be broken today. He replied: Anas ! Allah's decree is retaliation. But the people were agreeable to accepting a fine, so the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Among Allah's servants there are those who, if they adjured Allah, He (Allah) would consent to it.   Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: He was asked : How retaliation of a tooth is taken ? He said: It is broken with a file.
4596 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The Jews were split up into seventy-one or seventy-two sects; and the Christians were split up into seventy one or seventy-two sects; and my community will be split up into seventy-three sects.
4597 | Abu `Amir al-Hawdhani said:Mu`awiyah b. Abi Sufiyan stood among us and said: Beware! The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) stood among us and said: Beware! The people of the Book before were split up into seventy two sects, and this community will be split into seventy three: seventy two of them will go to Hell and one of them will go to Paradise, and it is the majority group.   Ibn Yahya and `Amr added in their version : “ There will appear among my community people who will be dominated by desires like rabies which penetrates its patient”, `Amr’s version has: “penetrates its patient. There remains no vein and no joint but it penetrates it.”
4598 | ‘A’ishah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited this verse: “He it is who has sent down to thee the Book: in it are verses basic or fundamental . . . .” Up to “men of understanding”. She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: When you see those people who follow that which is allegorical in the Quran, those are the people whom Allah has named (in the Quran). So avoid them.
4599 | Narrated AbuDharr:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The best of the actions is to love for the sake of Allah and to hate for the sake of Allah.
4600 | ‘Abd Allah b. Ka`b b. Malik who used to lead his father from among his sons when he became blind, said:I heard Ka`b b. Malik - the transmitter Ibn al-Sarh then narrated the story of his remaining behind from the Prophet (ﷺ) during the campaign of Tabuk - say: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade the Muslims to speak to any of us three. When (in this state) abundant time passed on me, I ascended the wall of the garden of Abu Qatadah who was my cousin. I saluted him, but, I swear by Allah, he did not return salute to me. He then narrated the story of the revelation of the Qur’anic verses relating to his repentance.
4601 | ‘Ammar b. Yasir said:I came to my family when my hands had cracks. They dyed me with saffron. I then went to Prophet (ﷺ) and saluted him, but he did not return me salutation. He said: Go and wash it away from you.
4602 | ‘A’ishah said:The camel of Safiyyah daughter of Huyayy was fatigued, and Zainab had a surplus mount. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Zainab : Give her the camel. She said: Should I give to that Jewess? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) became angry and kept away from her during Dhu al-Hijjah, Muharram, and a part of Safar.
4603 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Controverting about the Qur'an is disbelief.
4604 | Narrated Al-Miqdam ibn Ma'dikarib:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Beware! I have been given the Qur'an and something like it, yet the time is coming when a man replete on his couch will say: Keep to the Qur'an; what you find in it to be permissible treat as permissible, and what you find in it to be prohibited treat as prohibited. Beware! The domestic ass, beasts of prey with fangs, a find belonging to confederate, unless its owner does not want it, are not permissible to you If anyone comes to some people, they must entertain him, but if they do not, he has a right to mulct them to an amount equivalent to his entertainment.
4605 | Narrated AbuRafi':      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Let me not find one of you reclining on his couch when he hears something regarding me which I have commanded or forbidden and saying: We do not know. What we found in Allah's Book we have followed.
4606 | `A'ishah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:If any one introduces into this affair of ours anything which does not belong to it, it is rejected. Ibn `Isa said: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone practices any action in a way other than our practice, it is rejected.
4607 | Narrated Irbad ibn Sariyah:      AbdurRahman ibn Amr as-Sulami and Hujr ibn Hujr said: We came to Irbad ibn Sariyah who was among those about whom the following verse was revealed: "Nor (is there blame) on those who come to thee to be provided with mounts, and when thou saidst: "I can find no mounts for you."        We greeted him and said: We have come to see you to give healing and obtain benefit from you.        Al-Irbad said: One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in prayer, then faced us and gave us a lengthy exhortation at which the eyes shed tears and the hearts were afraid.        A man said: Messenger of Allah! It seems as if it were a farewell exhortation, so what injunction do you give us?        He then said: I enjoin you to fear Allah, and to hear and obey even if it be an Abyssinian slave, for those of you who live after me will see great disagreement. You must then follow my sunnah and that of the rightly-guided caliphs. Hold to it and stick fast to it. Avoid novelties, for every novelty is an innovation, and every innovation is an error.
4608 | ‘Abd Allah b. Mas’ud reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:"Beware! The extremists perished," saying it three times.
4609 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone summons other to follow right guidance, his reward will be equivalent to that of the people who follow him, without their rewards being diminished in any respect on that account; and if anyone summons others to follow error the sin of which sins being diminished in any respect on that account.
4610 | ‘Amir b. sa’id on his father’s authority reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:The Muslim who offends most against the Muslims is he who enquires about something which has not been forbidden to men, and it is declared forbidden because of his enquiry.
4611 | Yazid b. ‘Umairah, who was one of the companions of Mu’adh b. Jabal said:Whenever he (mu’adh b. jabal) sat in a meeting for preaching, he would say: Allah is a just arbiter; those who doubt would perish. One day Mu’adh b. jabal said: In the times after you there would be trails in which riches would be abundant. During these trails the Quran would be easy so much so that every believer, hypocrite, man, woman, young, grown up, slave and free man will learn it. Then a man might say: What happened with the people that they do not follow me while I read the Quran? They are not going to follow me until I introduce a novelty for them other than it. So avoid that which is innovated (in religion), for whichever is innovated is an error. I warn you of the deviation of a scholar from right guidance, for sometimes Satan utters a word of error through the tongue of a scholar; and sometimes a hypocrites may speak a word of truth. I said to Mu’adh b. jabal: I am at a loss to understand may Allah have mercy on you that a learned man sometimes may speak a word of error and a hypocrite may speak a word of truth. He replied: Yes, avoid the speech of a learned man on distract you from him (the learned), for it is possible that he may withdraw (from these well-known things), and you get the truth when you hear it, for truth has light.   Abu Dawud said: In this tradition Ma’mar on the authority of  al-Zuhrl said: The words “wa la yun iyannaka” instead of “wa la yuthniyannaka,” with the same meaning: “it may not distract you” salih b. Kaisan on the authority of al-Zurhrl said in this tradition the words “al-mushtaharat” (well-know things). He also said the word “La yuthniyannaka” as ‘Uqail mentioned. Ibn ishaq, on the authority of al-Zuhri, said: Yes, if you are doubtful about the speech of a scholar until you say: WHAT did he mean by this word?
4612 | Sufyan said (according to one chain), and Abu al-Salit said (according to another chain):A man wrote to 'Umar b. 'Abd al-Aziz asking him about Divine decree. He wrote to him: To begin with, I enjoin upon you to fear Allah, to be moderate in (obeying) His Command, to follow the sunnah (practice) of His Prophet (ﷺ) and to abandon the novelties which the innovators introduced after his Sunnah has been established and they were saved from its trouble (i.e. novelty or innovation) ; so stick to Sunnah, for it is for you, if Allah chooses, a protection ; then you should know that any innovation which the people introduced was refuted long before it on the basis of some authority or there was some lesson in it, for the Sunnah was introduced by the people who were conscious of the error, slip, foolishness, and extremism in case of (the sunnah) was opposed. So accept for yourself what the people (in the past) had accepted for themselves, for they had complete knowledge of whatever they were informed, and by penetrating insight they forbade (to do prohibited acts); they had more strength (than us) to disclose the matters (of religion), and they were far better (than us) by virtue of their merits. If right guidance is what you are following, then you outstriped them to it. And if you say whatever the novelty occurred after them was introduced by those who followed the way other then theirs and disliked them. It is they who actually outstripped, and talked about it sufficiently, and gave a satisfactory explanation for it. Below them there is no place for exhaustiveness, and above them there is no place for elaborating things. Some people shortened the matter more than they had done, and thus they turned away (from them), and some people raised the matter more than they had done, and thus they exaggerated. They were on right guidance between that. You have written (to me) asking about confession of Divine decree, you have indeed approached a person who is well informed of it, with the will of Allah. I know what whatever novelty people have brought in, and whatever innovation people have introduced are not more manifest and more established than confession of Divine decree. The ignorant people (i.e. the Arabs before Islam) in pre-Islamic times have mentioned it ; they talked about it in their speeches and in their poetry. They would console themselves for what they lost, and Islam then strengthened it (i.e. belief in Divine decree). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not mention it in one or two traditions, but the Muslims heard it from him, and they talked of it from him, and they talked of it during his lifetime and after his death. They did so out of belief and submission to their Lord and thinking themselves weak. There is nothing which is not surrounded by His knowledge, and not counted by His register and not destined by His decree. Despite that, it has been strongly mentioned in His Book: from it they have derived it, and from it they have and so ? they also read in it what you read, and they knew its interpretation of which you are ignorant. After that they said: All this is by writing and decreeing. Distress has been written down, and what has been destined will occur ; what Allah wills will surely happen, and what He does not will will not happen. We have no power to harm or benefit ourselves. Then after that they showed interest (in good works) and were afraid (of bad deeds).
4613 | Nafi said:Ibn ‘Umar had a friend from the people of Syria who used to correspond with him. ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar wrote to him: I have been informed that you have talked something about Divine decree. You should write it to me, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Among my community there will be people who will falsify Divine decree.
4614 | Khalid al-Hadhdha said:I said to al-Hasan: Abu Sa’id, tell me about Adam. Was he created for the heaven or the earth? He said: No, for the earth. I said: It was unavoidable for him. I said: Tell me about the following verse of the Quran: ”can lead (any) into temptation concerning Allah, except such as are (themselves) going to blazing fire.” He said: The devils do not lead anyone astray by their temptation except the one whom Allah destined to go to Hell.
4615 | Khalid al-Hadhdha, asked al-Hasan about the Quranic verse:“And for this did He create them.” He said: He created these for this and those for that.
4616 | Khalid al-Hadhdha asked al-Hasan about the Quranic verse:“Can lead (any) into temptation concerning Allah, except such as are (themselves) going to the blazing fire.” He said: Except the one whom Allah destined that he should go to Hell.
4617 | Humaid said:Al-Hasan used to say that his fall from the heaven on the earth is dearer to him than uttering: The matter is in my hand.
4618 | Humaid said:Al-Hasan came to us. The jurists of Mecca told me that I should speak to him that some day he should hold a meeting for them and preach to them. He said: Yes. So they gathered and he addressed them. I did not see anyone on orator greater than him. A man said: Abu Sa’id, who created Satan? He replied: Glory be to Allah! Is there any creator other than Allah? Allah created Satan, and he created good and created evil. The man said: May Allah ruin them! How do they lie to this old man.
4619 | Humaid al-Tawil asked al-Hasan about the verse:“Even so do We let it creep into the hearts of the sinners.” He said: Polytheism
4620 | Explaining the Quranic verse; “And between them and their desire is placed a barrier.” Al-Hasan said:Between them and their faith.
4621 | Ibn ‘Awn said:I was a prisoner in Syria. A man called me from behind. I turned towards him and suddenly found that it was Raja b. Haiwah. He said: Abu ‘Awn, what is this that the people are telling about al-Hasan? I said: They are much lying to al-Hasan.
4622 | Hammad said:I heard Ayyub say: Two kinds of people have lied to al-Hasan: people who believed in free will and they intended that they publicise their belief by it; and people who had enmity with and hostility (for al-Hasan), saying: Did he not say so and so? Did he not say so and so?
4623 | Yahya b. Kathir al-‘Anbari said:Qurrah b. Khalid used to tell us: O young people! Do not think that al-Hasan denied predestination, for his opinion (i.e., belief) was sunnah and sight.
4624 | Ibn ‘Awn said:If we learnt that the remark of al-Hasan would reach the extent that it has reached, we would write a book for his withdrawal and call witnesses to him; but we said: This is a remark that surprisingly came out (from him) and it will not be transmitted to others.
4625 | Ayyub said:Al-Hasan said: I will never return to it.
4626 | ‘Uthman al-Batti said:Al-Hasan never interpreted any Quranic verse but to establish (Divine decree).
4627 | Ibn ‘Umar said:We used to say in the times of the Prophet (ﷺ): We do not compare anyone with Abu Bakr. ’Umar came next and then ‘Uthman. We then would leave (rest of) the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) without treating any as superior to other.
4628 | Ibn ‘Umar said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was alive, we used to say: The most excellent member of the community of the Prophet (ﷺ) after himself is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then 'Uthman.
4629 | Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyyah said:I said to my father: Which of the people after the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is best? He replied: Abu Bakr. I then asked: Who comes next? He said: ‘Umar. I was then afraid of asking him who came next, and he might mention ‘Uthman, so I said: You came next, O my father? He said: I am only a man among the Muslims.
4630 | Muhammad al-Firyabl said:I heard Sufyan say: If anyone thinks that ‘All (Allah be pleased with him) was more deserving for the Caliphate than both of them, he imputed error to Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, the Muhajirun (Immigrants), and the Ansar (Helpers) Allah be pleased with all of them. I think that with this (belief) none of his action will rise to the heaven.
4631 | Sufyan al-Thawri said:The Caliphs are five: Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘All and ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-Aziz.
4632 | Ibn 'Abbas said:Abu Hurairah said that a man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: I saw (in my dream) a piece of cloud from which ghee and honey were dropping. I saw the people spreading their hands. Some of them took much and some a little. I also saw a rope hanging from Heaven to Earth. I saw, Messenger of Allah, that you caught hold of it and ascended by it. Then another man caught hold of it and ascended it. Then another man caught hold of it and ascended it. Then another man caught hold of it, but it broke, and then it was joined and he ascended it.        AbuBakr said: May my parents be sacrificed for you, if you allow, I shall interpret it.        He said: Interpret it.  He said: The piece of cloud is the cloud of Islam; the ghee and honey that were dropping from it are the Qur'an, which contains softness and sweetness. Those who received much or little of it are those who learn much or little of the Qur'an. The rope hanging from Heaven to Earth is the truth which you are following. You catch hold of it and then Allah will raise you to Him. Then another man will catch hold of it and ascend it, Then another man will catch hold of it and it will break. But it will be joined and he will ascend it. Tell me. Messenger of Allah, whether I am right or wrong.        He said: You are partly right and partly wrong.  He said: I adjure you by Allah, you should tell me where I am wrong.        The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Do not take an oath.
4633 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Ibn ‘abbas through a different chain of narrators. This version adds:He refused to tell him (his mistake).
4634 | Narrated AbuBakrah:      One day the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Which of you had dream? A man said: It is I. I saw as though a scale descended from the sky. You and AbuBakr were weighed and you were heavier; AbuBakr and Umar were weighed and AbuBakr was heavier: Umar and Uthman were weighed and Umar was heavier; than the scale was taken up. we saw signs of dislike on the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
4635 | Abu Bakrah said:One day the Prophet (ﷺ) asked: Which of you had a dream? He then mentioned the rest of the tradition to the same effect, but he did not mention the word “disliked”. Instead, he said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was grieved about that. He then said: There will be a caliphate on the model of prophecy, then Allah will give the kingdom to whom he wills.
4636 | Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Last night a good man had a vision in which Abu Bakr seemed to be joined to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). ‘Umar to Abu Bakr, and ‘Uthman to ‘Umar. Jabir said: When we got up and left the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we said: The good man is the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and that their being joined together means that they are the rulers over this matter with which Allah has sent His Prophet (ﷺ).   Abu Dawud said: It has been transmitted by Yunus and Shu’aib, but they did not mention ‘Amr b. Aban.
4637 | Samurah b. Jundub told that a man said:Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)! I saw (in a dream) that a bucket was hung from the sky. Abu Bakr came, caught hold of both ends of its wooden handle, and drank a little of it. Next came ‘Umar who caught hold of both ends of its wooden handle and drank of it to his fill. Next came ‘Uthman who caught hold of both ends of its handle and drank of it to his fill. Next came ‘All. He caught hold of both ends of its handle, but it became upset and some (water) from it was sprinkled on him.
4638 | Makhul said:The Romans will enter the Levant and stay there for forty days, and no place will be saved from them but Damascus and 'Uman.

4640 | Makhul reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:The place of the assembly of Muslims at the time of war will be in a land called al-Ghutah.
4641 | ‘Awf said:I heard al-Hajjaj addressing the people say: The similitude of ‘Uthman with Allah is like the similitude of Jesus son of Mary. He then recited the following verse and explained it: “Behold! Allah said: O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehood) of those who blaspheme.” He was making a sign with his hand to us and to the people of Syria.
4642 | Al-Rabi’ b. Khalid al-Dabbi said:I heard al-Hajjaj say in his address: Is the messenger of one of you sent for some need is more respectable with him or his successor among his people? I thought in my mind: I make a vow for Allah that I shall never pray behind you. If I find people who fight against you, I shall fight against you along with them. Ishaq added in his version: He fought in the battle of al-Jamajim until he was killed.
4643 | ‘Asim said:I heard al-Hajjaj say on the pulpit: Fear Allah as much as possible; there is no exception in it. Hear and obey the Commander of the Faithful ‘Abd al-Malik; there is no exception in it. I swear by Allah, if order people to come but from a certain gate of the mosque, and they come out from another gate, their blood and their properties will be lawful for me. I swear by Allah, if I seize the tribe of Rabi’ah for the tribe of Mudar, it is lawful for me from Allah. Who will apologies to me for the slave of Hudhail (i.e. ‘Abd Allah b. Mas’ud) who thinks that his reading of the Quran is from Allah. I swear by Allah, it is a rhymed prose of the Bedouins. Allah did not reveal it to his Prophet (ﷺ). Who will apologies to me for these clients (non-Arab). One of them thinks that he will throw a stone and when it falls (on the ground) he says: Something new has happened. I swear by Allah, I shall leave them (ruined and perished) like the day that passes away.   He said: I mentioned it to al-A’mash. He said: I swear by Allah, I heard it from him.
4644 | Al-A’mash said:These clients (i.e., non-Arabs) are to be struck and cut off. I swear by Allah, if I strike a stick with a stick, I would annihilate them like the day that passed away. Al-hamra means clients or non-Arabs.
4645 | Sulaiman al-A’mash said:I prayed the Friday prayer with al-Hajjaj and he addressed. He then transmitted the tradition of Abu Bakr b. ‘Ayyash. He said in it: Hear and obey the caliph of Allah and his select ‘Abd al-Malik bin Marwan. He then transmitted the rest of the tradition, and said: If I seized Rabi’ah for Mudar. But he did not mention the story of the clients (i.e. non Arabs).
4646 | Narrated Safinah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The Caliphate of Prophecy will last thirty years; then Allah will give the Kingdom of His Kingdom to anyone He wills.    Sa'id told that Safinah said to him: Calculate Abu Bakr's caliphate as two years, 'Umar's as ten, 'Uthman's as twelve and 'Ali so and so. Sa'id said: I said to Safinah: They conceive that 'Ali was not a caliph. He replied: The buttocks of Marwan told a lie.
4647 | Safinah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:The caliphate of Prophecy will last thirty years; then Allah will give the Kingdom to whom he wishes; or his kingdom to whom he wishes.
4648 | Narrated Sa'id ibn Zayd ibn Amr ibn Nufayl:      Abdullah ibn Zalim al-Mazini said: I heard Sa'id ibn Zayd ibn Amr ibn Nufayl say: When so and so came to Kufah, and made so and so stand to address the people, Sa'id ibn Zayd caught hold of my hand and said: Are you seeing this tyrant? I bear witness to the nine people that they will go to Paradise. If I testify to the tenth too, I shall not be sinful.        I asked: Who are the nine?  He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said when he was on Hira': Be still, Hira', for only a Prophet, or an ever-truthful, or a martyr is on you.  I asked: Who are those nine?  He said: The Messenger of Allah, AbuBakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, Talhah, az-Zubayr, Sa'd ibn AbuWaqqas and AbdurRahman ibn Awf.  I asked: Who is the tenth? He paused a moment and said: it is I.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by al-Ashja'i, from Sufyan, from Mansur, from Hilal b. Yasaf, from Ibn Hayyan on the authority of 'Abd Allah b. Zalim through his different chain of narrators in a a similar manner.

Then Sa'id ibn Zayd ibn Amr ibn Nufayl came and he welcomed him, greeted him, and seated him near his foot on the throne. Then a man of the inhabitants of Kufah, called Qays ibn Alqamah, came. He received him and began to abuse him.        Sa'id asked: Whom is this man abusing?  He replied: He is abusing Ali.  He said: Don't I see that the companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) are being abused, but you neither stop it nor do anything about it? I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say--and I need not say for him anything which he did not say, and then he would ask me tomorrow when I see him --AbuBakr will go to Paradise and Umar will go to Paradise. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition to the same effect (as in No. 4632).        He then said: The company of one of their man whose face has been covered with dust by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is better than the actions of one of you for a whole life time even if he is granted the life-span of Noah.
4651 | Anas b. malik said:The prophet of Allah (ﷺ) ascended Uhud, and Abu Bakr, ’Umar and 'Uthman followed him. It began to shake with them. The prophet of Allah (ﷺ) struck it with his foot and said: Be still, for only a prophet, an ever-truthful and two martyrs are on you.

Mas’ud then came to him and began to speak to the Prophet (ﷺ). Whenever he talk to him, he caught his beard ; and al-Mughirah b. Shu’bah was standing near the head of the Prophet (ﷺ) with a sword with him and a helmet on him.

Umar said to him: Do you find me in the Book?  He said: Yes.  He asked: How do you find me?  He said: I find you (like a) castle.  Then he raised a whip to him, saying: What do you mean by castle?  He replied: An iron castle and severely trustworthy.  He asked: How do you find the one who will come after me?  He said: I find him a pious caliph, except that he will prefer his relatives.  Umar said: May Allah have mercy on Uthman: He said it three times. He then asked: How do you find the one who will come after him?        He replied: I find him like rusty iron.  Umar then put his hand on his head, and said: O filthy! O filthy!  He said: Commander of the Faithful! He is a pious caliph, but when he is made caliph, the sword will be unsheathed and blood will be shed.    Abu Dawud said: Al-dafr means filth or evil smell.
4657 | ‘Imran b. Husain reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying :the best of my people is the generation in which I have been sent, then their immediate followers, then their immediate followers. Allah knows best whether he mentioned the third or not. After them will be people who will give testimony without being asked, who will make vows which they do not fulfill, who will be treacherous and not to be trusted, among whom fatness will appear.
4658 | Abu Sa’id (al-Khudri) reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :Do not revile my Companions; by him in whose hand my soul is, if one of you contributed the amount of gold equivalent to Uhud, it would not amount to as much as the mudd of one of them, or half of it.

Then they would come to Hudhaifah and tell him: We mentioned Salman what you said, but he neither testified you nor falsified you. So Hudhaifah came to salman who was in his vegetable farm, and said : Salman, what prevents you from testifying me of what I heard from the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) ? Salman said: The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) sometimes would be angry, and said in anger something to some of his Companions; he would be sometimes pleased and said in pleasure something to some of his Companions. Would you not stop until you create love of some people in the hearts of some people, and hatred of some people in the hearts of some people, and until you generate disagreement and dissension? You know that the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) addressed, saying : If I abused any person of my people, or cursed him in my anger. I am one of the children of Adam : I become angry as they become angry. He (Allah) has sent me as a mercy for all worlds.

He said: Ask someone to lead the people in prayer. So Abdullah ibn Zam'ah went out and found that Umar was present among the people and AbuBakr was not there. I said: Umar, get up and lead the people in prayer. So he came forward and uttered "Allah is Most Great". When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) heard his voice, as Umar had a loud voice, he said: Where is AbuBakr? Allah does not allow that, and the Muslims too; Allah does not allow that, and the Muslims too.

4693 | Abu Musa al-Ash’ari reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :Allah created Adam from a handful which he took from the whole of the earth ; so the children of Adam are in accordance with the earth : some red, some white, some black, some a mixture, also smooth and rough, bad and good.
4694 | ‘Ali said:We attended a funeral at Baql’ al-Gharqad which was also attended by the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) came and sat down. He had a stick (in his hand) by which he began to scratch up the ground. He then raised his head and said : The place which every one of you and every soul of you will occupy in Hell or in Paradise has been recorded, and destined wicked or blesses. A man from among the people asked : Prophet of Allah! Should we not then trust simply in what has been recorded for us and abandon (doing good) deeds? Those who are among the number of the blessed will be inclined to blessing, and those of us who are among the number of the wicked will be inclined to wickedness. He replied : Go on doing good actions, for everyone is helped to do that for which he was created. Those who are among the number of wicked will be helped to do wicked deeds. The Prophet of Allah (May peace be upon him) then recited: “So he who gives (in charity) and fears (Allah), and in all sincerity testifies to the best, we will indeed make smooth for him the path to bliss. But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient, and gives the lie to the best, We will indeed make smooth for him the path of misery.”
4695 | Yahya b. Ya`mur said :The first to speak on Divine decree in al-Basrah was Ma`bad al Juhani. I and Humaid b. `Abd al-Rahman al-Himyari proceeded to perform Hajj or `Umrah. We said : would that we meet any of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) so that we could ask him about what they say with regard to divine decree. So Allah helped us to meet `Abd Allah b. `Umar who was entering the mosque. So I and my companion surrounded him, and I thought that my companion would entrust me the task of speaking to him. Then I said : Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman, there appeared on our side some people who recite the Qur'an and are engaged in the hair-splitting of knowledge. They conceive that there is no Divine decree and everything happens freely without predestination. He said : When you meet those people, tell them that I am free from them, and they are free from me. By Him by Whom swears ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar, if one of them has gold equivalent to Uhud and he spends it, Allah will not accept it from him until he believes in Divine decree. He then said : ‘Umar b. Khattab transmitted to me a tradition, saying : One day when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) a man with very white clothing and very black hair came up to us. No mark of travel was visible on him, and we did not recognize him. Sitting down beside the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), leaning his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs, he said : tell me, Muhammad, about Islam. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said : Islam means that you should testify that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah’s Apostle, that you should observe prayer, pay Zakat, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the house (i.e., Ka`bah), If you have the means to go. He said : You have spoken the truth. We were surprised at his questioning him and then declaring that he spoke the truth. He said : Now tell me about faith. He replied : It means that you should believe in Allah, his angels, his Books, his Apostles and the last day, and that you should believe in the decreeing both of good and evil. He said : You have spoken the truth. He said : now tell me about doing good (ihsan). He replied: It means that you should worship Allah as though you are seeing him; if you are not seeing him, he is seeing you. He said: Now tell me about the hour. He replied : The one who is asked about it is no better informed than the one who is asking. He said : Then tell me about its signs. He replied : That a maidservant should beget her mistress, and that you should see barefooted, naked, poor men and shepherds exalting themselves in buildings. ‘Umar said : He then went away, and I waited for three days, then he said : Do you know who the questioner was, `Umar? I replied : Allah and his Apostle know best. He said : He was Gabriel who came to you to teach you your religion.
4696 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Yahya b. Yamur and Humaid b. ‘Abd al-Rahman through a different chain of narrators. This version has :we met ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar. We told him about divine decree and what they said about it. He then mentioned something similar to it. He added : A man of Muzainah or juhainah asked : What is the good in doing anything, Messenger of Allah ? should we think that a thing has passed and gone or a thing that has happened now (without predestination)? He replied : About a thing that has passed and gone (i.e. predestined). A man or some people asked: Then, why action? He replied: Those who are among the number of those who go to Paradise will be helped to do the deeds of the people who will go to Paradise, and those who are among the number of those who go to Hell will be helped to do the deeds of those who will go to Hell.
4697 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Ibn Ya’mur, with additions and omissions, through a different chain of narrators. This version adds; He asked :What is Islam? He replied : It means saying prayer, payment of zakat, performing HAJJ, fasting during RAMADAN, and taking a bath on account of sexual defilement.   Abu Dawud said: 'Alqamah was a Murji'i.
4698 | Narrated AbuDharr and AbuHurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to sit among his Companions. A stranger would come and not recognize him (the Prophet) until he asked (about him). So we asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to make a place where he might take his seat so that when a stranger came, he might recognise him. So we built a terrace of soil on which he would take his seat, and we would sit beside him. He then mentioned something similar to this Hadith saying: A man came, and he described his appearance. He saluted from the side of the assembly, saying: Peace be upon you, Muhammad. The Prophet (ﷺ) then responded to him.
4699 | Ibn al-Dailami said :I went to Ubayy b. Ka’b and said him : I am confused about Divine decree, so tell me something by means of which Allah may remove the confusion from my mind. He replied : were Allah to punish everyone in the heavens and in the earth. He would do so without being unjust to them, and were he to show mercy to them his mercy would be much better than their actions merited. Were you to spend in support of Allah’s cause an amount of gold equivalent to Uhud, Allah would not accept it from you till you believed in divine decree and knew that what has come to you could not miss you and that what has missed you could not come to you. Were you to die believing anything else you would enter Hell. He said : I then went to ‘Abd Allah b. MAs’ud and he said something to the same effect. I next went to Hudhaifah b. al-Yaman and he said something to the same effect. I next went to Zaid b. Thabit who told me something from the Prophet (May peace be upon him) to the same effect.
4700 | Ubadah b. al Samit said to his son :Son! You will not get the taste of the reality of faith until you know that what has come to you could not miss you, and that what has missed you could not come to you. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: The first thing Allah created was the pen. He said to it: Write. It asked: What should I write, my Lord? He said: Write what was decreed about everything till the Last Hour comes. Son! I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say : He who dies on something other than this does not belong to me.
4701 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :Adam and Moses held a disputation. Moses said : Adam you are our father. You deprived us and caused us to come out from Paradise. Adam said : You are Moses Allah chose you for his speech and wrote the Torah for you with his hand. Do you blame me for doing a deed which Allah had decreed that I should do forty year before he created me? So Adam got the better of Moses in argument.   Ahmad b. Salih said from 'Amr from Tawus who heard Abu Hurairah.
4702 | ‘Umar b. al-Khattab reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :Moses said : My lord, show us Adam who caused us and himself to come out from Paradise. So Allah showed him Adam. He asked : Are you our father, Adam? Adam said to him : Yes. He said : Are you the one into whom Allah breathed of his spirit, taught you all the names, and commanded angels (to prostrate) and they prostrated to you? He replied : Yes. He asked : Then what moved you to cause us and yourself to come out from paradise? Adam asked him : And who are you? He said : Yes. He asked : Did you not find that was decreed in the book (records) of Allah before I was created? He replied : Yes. He asked : Then why do you blame me about a thing for which Divine decree had already passed before me ? The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said : So Adam got the better of Moses in argument (peace be upon him).
4703 | Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:      Muslim ibn Yasar al-Juhani said: When Umar ibn al-Khattab was asked about the verse "When your Lord took their offspring from the backs of the children of Adam" - al-Qa'nabi recited the verse--he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say when he was questioned about it: Allah created Adam, then passed His right hand over his back, and brought forth from it his offspring, saying: I have these for Paradise and these will do the deeds of those who go to Paradise. He then passed His hand over his back and brought forth from it his offspring, saying: I have created these for Hell, and they will do the deeds of those who go to Hell.        A man asked: What is the good of doing anything, Messenger of Allah?  The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: When Allah creates a servant for Paradise, He employs him in doing the deeds of those who will go to Paradise, so that his final action before death is one of the deeds of those who go to Paradise, for which He will bring him into Paradise. But when He creates a servant for Hell, He employs him in doing the deeds of those who will go to Hell, so that his final action before death is one of the deeds of those who go to Hell, for which He will bring him into Hell.
4704 | Nu’aim b. Rabl’ah said :I was with ‘Umar b. al-Khattab when he transmitted this tradition. The tradition of Malik is more perfect.
4705 | Ubayy b. Ka’b said :The boy whom al-Khidr had killed was created an infidel. Had he lived, he would have moved his parents to rebellion and unbelief.
4706 | Ubayy b. Ka’b said :I heard the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) explaining the verse “As for the youth his parents were people of Faith,” he was created infidel the day when he was created.
4707 | Ibn ‘Abbas said :Ubayy b. Ka’b told me that the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said : Al-khidr saw a youth playing with boys. He took him by his head and uprooted it. Moses then said : Hast thou slain an innocent person who had slain none.
4708 | ‘Abd Allah b. Mas’ud said :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) who spoke the truth and whose word was belief told us the following : The constituents of one of you are collected for forty days in his mother’s womb, then they become a piece of  congealed blood for a similar period, then they become a lump of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends to him an angel with four words who records his provision the period of his life, his deeds, and whether he will be miserable or blessed ; thereafter he breathes the spirit into him. One of you will do the deeds of those who go to Paradise so that there will be only a cubit between him and it or will be within a cubit, then what is decreed will overcome him so that he will do the deeds of those who go to Hell and will enter it; and one of you will do the deeds of those who go to hell, so that there will be only a cubit between him and it or will be within a cubit, then what is decreed will overcome him, so that he will do the deeds of those who go to Paradise and will enter it.
4709 | ‘Imran b. Husain said :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was asked : Is it known who are those who will go to paradise and those who will go to hell? He said : Yes. He asked : Then what is the good of doing anything by those who act? He replied : Everyone is helped to do for which he has been created.
4710 | ‘Umar reported the Prophet (May peace be upon him) was asked :Do not sit which those who believe in free will and do not address them before they address you.
4711 | Ibn ‘Abbas reported that when the Prophet (May peace be upon him) was questioned about the offspring of polytheists, he said :Allah knows best about what they were doing.
4712 | ‘A’ishah said :I said : Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) what happens to the offspring of believers ? He replied : They are joined to their parents. I asked : Messenger of Allah! Although they have done nothing ? He replied : Allah knows best what they were doing. I asked : what happens to the offspring of polytheists, Messenger of Allah ? he replied! They are joined to their parents. I asked : Although they have done nothing? He replied : Allah knows best what they were doing.
4713 | ‘A’ishah, mother of the believers, said :The Prophet (May peace be upon him) was invited to the funeral of a boy who belonged to the ANSAR and I said; Messenger of Allah! This one is blessed, for he has done no evil, nor has he known it. He replied : It may be otherwise, ‘A’ishah, for Allah created Paradise and created those who will go to it, and He created it for them when they were still in their father’s loins; and he created hell and created those who will go to it, and created it for them when they were still in their father’s loins.
4714 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :Every child is born on Islam, but his parents make him a Jew and a Christian, just as a beast is born whole. Do you find some among them (born) maimed? The people asked : Messenger of Allah! What do you think about the one who died while he was young? He replied : Allah knows best what he was going to do.
4715 | Abu Dawud said :Malik was asked : The heretics argue from this tradition against us. Malik said : Argue against them from its last part which goes. The people asked : What do you think about the one who died while he was young? He replied : Allah knows best what he was going to do.
4716 | Explaining the tradition “Every child is a born on Islam”, Hammad b. Salamah said :In our opinion it means that covenant which Allah had taken in the loins of their fathers when He said : “Am I not your Lord? They said: Yes.
4717 | ‘Amir reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :The woman who buries alive her new-born girl and the girl who is buried alive both will go to Hell. This tradition has also been transmitted by Ibn Mas’ud from the Prophet (May peace be upon him) to the same effect through a different chain of narrators.
4718 | Anas said :A man asked : where is my father, Messenger of Allah? He replied! Your father is in Hell. When he turned his back, he said : My father and your father are in Hell.
4719 | Anas b. Malik reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :The devil flows in a man like his blood.
4720 | ‘Umar b. al-Khattab reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :Do not sit with those who believe in free will and do not address them before they address you.
4721 | Abu Hurairah reported to the Messenger of Allah( may peace be upon him) as sayings:People will continue to ask one another(questions) till this is pronounced: Allah created all things, but who created Allah ? Whoever comes across anything of that, he should say: I believe in Allah.
4722 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: He then mentioned a tradition like it. This version adds: When they propound that, say: "Say Allah is one. Allah is He to Whom men repair. He has not begotten and He has not been begotten, and no one is equal to Him." Then one should spit three times on his left side and seek refuge in Allah from Satan.
4723 | Narrated Al-Abbas ibn AbdulMuttalib:      I was sitting in al-Batha with a company among whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting, when a cloud passed above them.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) looked at it and said: What do you call this?  They said: Sahab.        He said: And muzn?  They said: And muzn. He said: And anan?  They said: And anan.  AbuDawud said: I am not quite confident about the word anan.  He asked:  Do you know the distance between Heaven and Earth?  They replied: We do not know.  He then said: The distance between them is seventy-one, seventy-two, or seventy-three years. The heaven which is above it is at a similar distance (going on till he counted seven heavens). Above the seventh heaven there is a sea, the distance between whose surface and bottom is like that between one heaven and the next. Above that there are eight mountain goats the distance between whose hoofs and haunches is like the distance between one heaven and the next. Then Allah, the Blessed and the Exalted, is above that.
4724 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Simak through a different chain of narrators to the same effect.
4725 | The tradition mentioned above has again been transmitted by Simak through a different chain of narrators and to the same effect as this lengthy tradition.
4726 | Muhammad b. Jubair b. Mut’im said from his father on the authority of his grandfather:An A’rab(a nomadic Arab) came to the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) and said: People suffering distress, the children are hungry, the crops are withered, and the animals are perished, so ask Allah to grant us rain, for we seek you as our intercessor with Allah, and Allah as intercessor with you. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said: Woe to you: Do you know what you are saying? Then the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) declared Allah’s glory and he continued declaring His glory till the effect of that was apparent in the faces of his Companions. He then said: Woe to you: Allah is not to be sought as intercessor with anyone. Allah’s state is greater than that. Woe to you! Do you know how great Allah is? His throne is above the heavens thus(indicating with his fingers like a dome over him), and it groans on account of Him as a saddle does because of the rider.   Ibn Bashshar said in his version: Allah is above the throne, and the throne is above the heavens. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. ‘Abd al-A’la, Ibn al- Muthana and Ibn Bashshar transmitted it from Ya’qub b. ‘Utbah and Jubair b. Muhammad b. Jubair from his father on the authority of his grandfather.   Abu Dawud said: This tradition with the chain of Ahmad b. Sa’ad is sound. It has been approved by the body (of traditionists) , which includes Yahya b. Ma’in and ‘Ali b. al-Madani, and a group has transmitted it from Ibn Ishaq, as Ahmad also said. And so far as I have been informed ‘Abd al-A’la, Ibn al-Muthanna, and Ibn Bashshar had heard from the same copy(of the collection of tradition).
4727 | Jabir b. ‘Abd Allah reported the Prophet (May peace be upon him) as saying :I have been permitted to tell about one of Allah’s angels who bears the throne that the distance between the lobe of his ear and his shoulder is a journey of seven hundred years.
4728 | Abu Yunus Sulaim b. Jubair, client of Abu Hurairah, said :I heard Abu Hurairah recite this verse : “Allah doth command you to render back  your trusts to those to whom they are due” up to “For Allah is he who heareth and seeth all things”. He said : I saw the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) putting his thumb on his ear and finger on his eye.   Abu Hurairah said : I saw the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) reciting this verse and putting his fingers. Ibn Yunus said that al-Muqri said. “Allah hears and sees” means that Allah has the power of hearing and seeing.   Abu Dawud said: This is a refutation of the Jahmiyyah.
4729 | Jarir b. ‘Abd Allah said :When we are were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) he looked at the moon on the night when it was full, that is, fourteenth, and said : You will see your Lord as you see this (moon) and have no doubts about seeing him. If, therefore, you can keep from being prevented from prayer before the sun rises and before it sets, do so. He then recited :”Celebrate the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting”.
4730 | Abu Hurairah said :The people asked : Messenger of Allah! Shall we see our lord, the Exalted, on the Day of resurrection? He replied : Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun at noon when it is not in the cloud? They said: No. He asked : Do you feel any trouble in seeing the moon on the night when it is full and not in the cloud? They replied: No. He said: By him in whose hand my soul is, you will not feel any trouble in seeing him except as much as you feel in seeing any of them.
4731 | Narrated AbuRazin al-Uqayli:      I asked: Messenger of Allah! will each one of us see his Lord? Ibn Mu'adh's version has: "being alone with Him, on the Day of Resurrection? And what sign is there is His creation?" He replied: AbuRazin! does each one of you not see the moon? Ibn Mu'adh's version has: "on the night when it is full, being alone with it?"  Then the agreed version goes: I said: Yes. He said: Allah is more great. Ibn Mu'adh's version has: It is only part of Allah's creation, but Allah is more glorious and greater.
4732 | ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying:Allah will fold the heavens an the day of Resurrection, then seizing them in His right hand he will say: I am the king. Where are the mighty men? Where are the proud men? He will then fold the earths and take them in his other hand (According to the version of Ibn al-Ala), and then  say ; I am the King. Where are the mighty men? Where are the proud men?
4733 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (May peace be upon him) as saying; Our lord gets down every night to the heaven of this world when a third night remains and says :(Is there anyone) who prays to Me so that I may accept his prayer? (Is there anyone) who asks of Me so that I may give him? (Is there anyone) who asks for my forgiveness so that I may forgive him?

4737 | Ibn ‘abbas said :The Prophet (May peace be upon him) used to seek refuge in Allah for al-Hasan and al-husain, saying ; I seek refuge for both of you in the perfect words of Allah from every devil and every poisonous thing and from the evil eye which influences. He would then say; your father sought refuge in Allah by them for Ismail and Ishaq.   Abu Dawud said; this is a proof of the fact that the Quran is not created.
4738 | ‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:"When Allah, the exalted, speaks to send revelation, the inhabitants of heaven hear the clanging of a bell from the heavens like a chain being dragged across a rock, and they swoon. They continue to remain like that until Jibril comes to them. When he comes to them, they recover and say: 'O Jibril, what did your Lord say?' He would say: 'The truth,' and they would say: 'The truth, the truth.'"

By Thy might, no one who hears of it will fail to enter it.        He then surrounded it with disagreeable things, and said: Go and look at it, Gabriel.  He went and looked at it, then came and said: O my Lord! By Thy might, I am afraid that no one will enter it.        When Allah created Hell, He said: Go and look at it, Gabriel.  He went and looked at it, then came and said: O my Lord! By Thy might, no one who hears of it will enter it.        He then surrounded it with desirable things and said: Go and look at it, Gabriel.  He went, looked at it, then came and said: O my Lord! By Thy might and power, I am afraid that no one will remain who does not enter it.
4745 | Ibn ‘Umar reported the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) as saying:Before you there will be a pond the distance between whose sides is like that between Jarbah and Adhruh.
4746 | Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam:      We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said when we arrived at a halting place: You are not a hundred thousandth part of those who will come down to me at the pond. I (the narrator AbuHamzah) asked: What was your number that day? He replied: Seven or eight hundred.
4747 | Anas b. Malik said:The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) dozed for a short while and raised his smiling. He either said to them(people) or they said to him: Messenger of Allah! Why did you laugh? He said: A surah has been revealed to me just now, and then he recited: “In the name of Allah, Most Gracious. Most Merciful. To thee We have granted the fount (of abundance)” up to the end. When he recited, he asked: Do you know what al-kauthar is?  They replied: Allah and his Apostle know best. He said: It is a river which my Lord, the Exalted, has promised me( to grant) in Paradise: there is abundance of good and  upon it there is a pond which my people will approach on the Day of Resurrection. There are vessels as numerous as stars(in the sky).
4748 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      When the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) was lifted to the heavens (for travelling) in Paradise, or as he said, a river whose banks were of transparent or hollowed pearls was presented to him. The angel who was with him struck it with his hand and took out musk. Muhammad (ﷺ) then asked the angel who was with him: What is this? He replied: It is al-Kawthar which Allah has given you.
4749 | AbdusSalam ibn AbuHazim AbuTalut said:I saw AbuBarzah who came to visit Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad. Then a man named Muslim who was there in the company mentioned it to me.     When Ubaydullah saw him, he said: This Muhammadan [i.e. Companion of Muhammad (ﷺ)] of yours is short and fat. The old man (i.e. AbuBarzah) understood it.    So he said: I did not think I would remain amongst a people who would criticize me for having had the company of Muhammad (ﷺ).  Thereupon Ubaydullah said to him: The company of Muhammad (ﷺ) is a honour for you, not a disgrace. He added: I called for you to ask about the Haud (reservoir or cistern). Did you hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say anything about it?  AbuBarzah said: Yes, not once, twice, thrice, four times or five times. Whoever disbelieves in it, may Allah not supply him with water from it. He then went away angrily.
4750 | Al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib reported the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) as saying:When a Muslim is questioned in the grave he testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah’s Apostle. That is verified by Allah’s words: “Allah establishes those who believe with the word that stands firm.”
4751 | Anas b. Malik said:The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) entered the garden of the palm trees of Banu al-Najjar. He heard a voice and was terrified. He asked: Who are the people buried in these graves? The people replied: Messenger of Allah! These are some people who died in the pre-Islamic times. He said: Seek refuge in Allah from the punishment of the fire, and the trail of Antichrist. They asked: Why is it that, Messenger of Allah? He said: When a man is placed in his grave, an angel comes to him and says to him: Whom did you worship? Allah then guides him and he says: I worshiped Allah. He is then asked: What was your opinion of this man? He replies: He is Allah’s servant and His Apostle. He will not then be asked about anything else. He will then be taken to his abode in Hell and will be told: This was your abode in Hell, but Allah protected you and had mercy on you substituted for you an abode in Paradise for it. He will say: Leave me so that I may go and give glad tidings to my family. He will be told: Dwell. When an infidel is placed in his grave, an angel comes to him, reprimands him and asks him: Whom did you worship? He replies: I do not know. He will be told: You neither knew nor did you follow(the believers). He is then asked: What was your opinion on this man? He replies: I held the opinion that the other people held. He will then give him a blow between his ears with an iron hammer and will utter a shout which will be heard by all the creatures(near him) with the exception of men and jinn.
4752 | The tradition mentioned above has also transmitted by ‘Abd al-Wahhab through a different chain of narrators in a similar manner. This version has :When a  man is placed in his grave and his friends leave him, he hears the beat of their sandals. Then two angles come and speak to him. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition nearly similar to the previous one. It goes : As for the infidel and hypocrite they say to them. This version adds the word “hypocrite”. And he said : those who are near him will hear (his shout) with the exception of men and jinn.
4753 | Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:      We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) accompanying the bier of a man of the Ansar. When we reached his grave, it was not yet dug. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat down and we also sat down around him as if birds were over our heads. He had in his hand a stick with which he was scratching the ground.        He then raised his head and said: Seek refuge with Allah from the punishment in the grave. He said it twice or thrice.        The version of Jabir adds here: He hears the beat of their sandals when they go back, and at that moment he is asked: O so and so! Who is your Lord, what is your religion, and who is your Prophet?        Hannad's version says: Two angels will come to him, make him sit up and ask him: Who is your Lord?        He will reply: My Lord is Allah.  They will ask him: What is your religion?  He will reply: My religion is Islam.  They will ask him: What is your opinion about the man who was sent on a mission among you?  He will reply: He is the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).  They will ask: Who made you aware of this?  He will reply: I read Allah's Book, believed in it, and considered it true; which is verified by Allah's words: "Allah's Book, believed in it, and considered it true, which is verified by Allah's words: "Allah establishes those who believe with the word that stands firm in this world and the next."        The agreed version reads: Then a crier will call from Heaven: My servant has spoken the truth, so spread a bed for him from Paradise, clothe him from Paradise, and open a door for him into Paradise. So some of its air and perfume will come to him, and a space will be made for him as far as the eye can see.        He also mentioned the death of the infidel, saying: His spirit will be restored to his body, two angels will come to him, make him sit up and ask him: Who is your Lord?        He will reply: Alas, alas! I do not know.  They will ask him: What is your religion?  He will reply: Alas, alas! I do not know.  They will ask: Who was the man who was sent on a mission among you?  He will reply: Alas, alas! I do not know. Then a crier will call from Heaven: He has lied, so spread a bed for him from Hell, clothe him from Hell, and open for him a door into Hell. Then some of its heat and pestilential wind will come to him, and his grave will be compressed, so that his ribs will be crushed together.        Jabir's version adds: One who is blind and dumb will then be placed in charge of him, having a sledge-hammer such that if a mountain were struck with it, it would become dust. He will give him a blow with it which will be heard by everything between the east and the west except by men and jinn, and he will become dust. Then his spirit will be restored to him.
4754 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Al-Bara’ (b. ‘Azib) from the prophet (May peace be upon him) through a different chain of narrators is a similar way.
4755 | ‘A’ishah said that she thought of Hell and wept. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) asked her :What makes you weep ? She replied : I thought of Hell and wept. Will you remember your family on the 4th Day of resurrection ? the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said : There are three places where no one will remember anyone: at the scale until one knows whether his weight is light or heavy; at (the examination of) the book when one is commanded : Take and read Allah’s record, until he knows whether his book will be put into his right hand, or into his left hand, or behind his back ; and the path when it is placed across JAHANNAM.
4756 | Narrated AbuUbaydah ibn al-Jarrah:      I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: There has been no Prophet after Noah who has not warned his people about the antichrist (Dajjal), and I warn you of him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) described him to us, saying: Perhaps some who have seen me and heard my words will live till his time. The people asked: Messenger of Allah! what will be the condition of our hearts on that day? Like what we are today? He replied: Or better.
4757 | Ibn Umar reported:The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) stood among the people and praised Allah in a way which is worthy of him, and mentioned the Antichrist (Dajjal), saying : I warn you of him, and there has been no prophet who has not warned his people about him, and Noah also warned his people about him. But I tell you about him a word which no Prophet had told his people : you should know that he will be blind in one eye, and Allah is not blind is one eye.
4758 | Narrated AbuDharr:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who separates from the community within a span takes off the noose of Islam from his neck.
4759 | Abu Dharr reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :How will you deal with the rulers (imams) who appropriate to themselves this booty? I said : I swear by him who sent you with the truth that at that time I shall put my sword on my shoulder and smite with it till I meet you, or I join you. He said: shall I not guide you to something better than that? You must show endurance till you meet me.
4760 | Umm Salamah, wife of the Prophet (May peace be upon him) is reported to have said:The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: You will have commanders some of whom you will approve and some of whom you will disapprove. He who expresses disapproval with his tongue (Abu Dawud said : This is Hisham’s version) is guiltless; and he who feels disapproval in his heart, is safe, but he who is pleased and follows them. He was asked; shall we not kill them, Messenger of Allah? Abu Dawud’s version has : Shall we not fight with them? He replied : No, so long as they pray.
4761 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Umm Salamah through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version has :He who disapproves is guiltless, and he who disapproves is safe. Qatadah said : it means one who feels its disapproval in his heart, and one who expresses disapproval in his heart.
4762 | ‘Arfajah told that he heard the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :various corruptions will arise in my community, so strike with sword the one who tries to cause separation in the matter of Muslims when they are united, whoever he be.
4763 | ‘Ubaidah (al-salman) said :‘Ali mentioned about the people of al Nahrawan, saying: Among them there will be a man with a defective hand or with a small hand. if you were not to overjoy. I would inform you of what Allah has promised (the reward for) those who will kill them at the tongue of Muhammad (May peace be upon him). I asked : Have you heard this from him? He replied : Yes, by the lord of the Ka’bah.
4764 | Abu sa’id al-khudri said :‘Ali sent some gold-mixed dust to the prophet (May peace be upon him). He divided it among the four : al-Aqra b. Habis al-Hanzall and then al-Mujashi, uyainah b. Badr al-fazari, zaid al-khail al-Ta’l, next to one of Banu nabhan, and ‘Alqamah b. ‘Ulathat al-Amiri (in general), next to one of Banu kulaib. The Quraish and the ansar became angry and said : He is giving to the chiefs of the people of Najd and leaving us. He said : I am giving them for reconciliation of their hearts. Then a man with deep-seated eyes, high cheek-bones, a projecting brow, a thick beard and a shaven head came forward and said: For Allah, Muhammad! He said : Who will obey Allah if I disobey Him? Allah entrusts me with power over the inhabitants of the earth, but you do not. A man asked to be allowed to kill him and I think he was Khalid b. al-Walid but he prevented him. Then when the man turned away, he said: From this one’s stock there will be people who recite the Quran, but it will not pass down their throats. They will sever from Islam and leave the worshippers of Idols alone; but if I live up to their time I shall certainly kill them as 'Ad were killed.
4765 | Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri ; Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Soon there will appear disagreement and dissension in my people; there will be people who will be good in speech and bad in work. They recite the Qur'an, but it does not pass their collar-bones. They will swerve from the religion as an animal goes through the animal shot at. They will not return to it till the arrow comes back to its notch. They are worst of the people and animals. Happy is the one who kills them and they kill him. They call to the book of Allah, but they have nothing to do with it. He who fights against them will be nearer to Allah than them (the rest of the people). The people asked: What is their sign? He replied: They shave the head.
4766 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Anas through a different chain of narrators in a similar manner. This version adds; Their sign is shaving the head and eliminating the hair. If you see them, kill them.   Abu Dawud said:Tasmid means uprooting the hair.
4767 | ‘Ali said:When I mention a tradition to you from the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him), it is dearer to me that I fall from the heaven than I lie on him. But when I talk to you about matters between me and you, then war is a deception. I heard the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) say: Towards the end of the time there will be people who are young in age and from Islam as an arrow goes through the animal aimed at, and their faith will not pass their throats. Wherever you meet them kill them, for their killing will bring a reward for him who kills them on the day of Resurrection.
4768 | Salamah b. Kuhail said:Zaid b. Wahb al-Juhani told us that he was in the army which proceeded to (fight with) the Khawarij in the company of `Ali. `Ali then said: O people! I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: there will appear from among my community people who recite the Qur'an, and your recitation has no comparison with their recitation, and your prayer has no comparison with their prayer, and your fasts have no comparison with their fasts. They will recite the Qur'an thinking that it is beneficial for them, while it is harmful for them. Their prayer will not pass their collar-bones. They will swerve from Islam as an arrow goes through the animal shot at. If the army that is approaching them knows what (reward) has been decided for them at the tongue of their Prophet (ﷺ), they would leave (other good) activities. The sign of that is that among them there will be a man who has an upper arm, but not hand; on his upper arm there will be something like the nipple of a female breast, having white hair thereon. Will you go to Mu`awiyah and the people of Syria, and leave them behind among your children and property? I swear by Allah, I hope these are the same people, for they shed the blood unlawfully, and attacked the cattle of the people so go on in the name of Allah. Salamah b. Kuhail said: Zaid b. Wahb then informed me of all the halting places one by one, (saying): Until we passed a bridge. When we fought with each other, `Abd Allah b. Wahb al-Rasibi, who was the leader of the Khawarij, said to them: Throw away the lances and pull out the swords from their sheaths, for I am afraid they will adjure you as they had adjured on the day of Harura. So they threw away their lances and pulled out their swords, and the people pierced them with their lances. They were killed (lying one on the other). On that day only two persons of the partisans (of `Ali) were afflicted. `Ali said: Search for the man with the crippled hand. But they could not find him. Then `Ali got up himself and went to the people who had been killed and were lying on one another. He said: Take them out. They found him just near the ground. So he shouted: Allah is Most Great! He said: Allah spoke the truth, and His Apostle has conveyed. `Ubaidat al-Salmani stood up to him, saying: Commander of the Faithful! Have you heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: Yes, by him, there is no God but He. He put to swear thrice and he swore.
4769 | ‘Ali said:Search for the man with crippled hand. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. This version has: They took him out from beneath the slain in the dust. Abu al-wadi said: As if I am looking at an Abyssinian with a shirt on him. He had one of his hands like the nipple of the female breast, having hair on it like the hair on the tail of the jerboa.
4770 | Abu Maryam said:This man with the crippled hand was on that day with us in the mosque. We would sit with him by day and by night, and he was a poor man. I saw him attending the meals of ‘Ali (ra) which he took with the people, and I clothed him with a cloak of mine.   Abu Maryam said: The man with the crippled hand was called Nafi` Dhu al-Thadyah (Nafi`, man of nipple). He had in his hand something like a female breast with a nipple at it ends like the nipple of the female breast. If had some hair on it like the whiskers of cat.   Abu Dawud said: He was known among the people by the name of Harqus.
4771 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If the property of anyone is designed to be taken away without any right and he fights and is killed, he is a martyr.
4772 | Narrated Sa'id ibn Zayd:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who is killed while protecting his property is a martyr, and he who is killed while defending his family, or his blood, or his religion is a martyr.
4773 | Anas said:the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was one of the best of men in character. One day he sent me to do something, and I said: I swore by Allah that I would not go. But in my heart I felt that I should go to do what the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) had commanded me; so I went out and came upon some boys who were playing in the street. All of a sudden the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who had come up behind caught me by the back of the neck, and when I looked at him he was laughing. He said: Go where I ordered you, little Anas. I replied: Yes, I am going, Apostle of Allah! Anas said: I swear by Allah, I served him for seven or nine years, and he never said to me about a thing which I had done: Why did you do such and such? Nor about a thing which I left: why did not do such and such?
4774 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      I served the Prophet  (ﷺ) at Medina for ten years. I was a boy. Every work that I did was not according to the desire of my master, but he never said to me: Fie, nor did he say to me: Why did you do this? or Why did you not do this?
4775 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to sit with us in meetings and talk to us. When he stood up we also used to stand up and see him entering the house of one of his wives. One day he talked to us and we stood up as he stood up and we saw that an Arabi (a nomadic Arab) caught hold of him and gave his cloak a violent tug making his neck red.        AbuHurayrah said: The cloak was coarse. He turned to him and the Arabi said to him: Load these two camels of mine, for you do not give me anything from your property or from your father's property.        The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: No, I ask Allah's forgiveness; no, I ask Allah's forgiveness; no, I ask Allah's forgiveness. I shall not give you the camel-load until you make amends for the way in which you tugged at me.        Each time the Arabi said to him: I swear by Allah, I shall not do so.        He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. He (the Prophet), then called a man and said to him: Load these two camels of his: one camel with barley and the other with dates. He then turned to us and said: Go on your way with the blessing of Allah.
4776 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Good way, dignified good bearing and moderation are the twenty-fifth part of Prophecy.
4777 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Anas:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If anyone suppresses anger when he is in a position to give vent to it, Allah, the Exalted, will call him on the Day of Resurrection over the heads of all creatures, and ask him to choose any of the bright and large eyed maidens he wishes.   Abu Dawud said: The name of the transmitter Abu Marhum is 'Abd al-Rahman b. Maimun
4778 | Suwaid b. Wahb quoted a son of a Companion of the Prophet (ﷺ) who said his father reported  the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:He then mentioned a similar tradition described above. This version has: Allah will fill his heart with security and faith. He did not mention the words "Allah will call him". This version further adds: He who gives up wearing beautiful garments when he is able to do so (out of humility, as Bishr's version has) will be clothed by Allah with the robe of honour, and he who marries for Allah's sake will be crowned by Allah with the crown of Kingdom.
4779 | `Abd Allah (b. Mas`ud) reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:Whom do you consider a wrestler among you? The people replied: (the man) whom the men cannot defeat in wrestling. He said: No, it is he who controls himself when he is angry.
4780 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      Two men reviled each other in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ) and one of them became excessively angry so much so that I thought that his nose will break up on account of excess of anger. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I know a phrase which, if he repeated, he could get rid of this angry feeling. They asked: What is it, Messenger of Allah? He replied: He should say: I seek refuge in Thee from the accursed devil. Mu'adh then began to ask him to do so, but he refused and persisted in quarrelling, and began to enhance his anger.
4781 | Sulaiman b. Surad said:Two men reviled each other in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ). Then the eyes of one of them became red and his jugular veins swelled. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said: I know a phrase by repeating which the man could get rid of the angry feelings: I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil. The man said: Do you see insanity in me.
4782 | Narrated AbuDharr:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to us: When one of you becomes angry while standing, he should sit down. If the anger leaves him, well and good; otherwise he should lie down.

So he stood and performed ablution; he then returned and performed ablution, and said: My father told me on the authority of my grandfather Atiyyah who reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Anger comes from the devil, the devil was created of fire, and fire is extinguished only with water; so when one of you becomes angry, he should perform ablution.
4785 | `A’ishah said:the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was never given his choice between two things without taking the easier(or lesser) of them provided it involved no sin, for if it did, no one kept farther away from it than he. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never took revenge on his own behalf for anything unless something Allah had forbidden has been transgressed, in which event he took revenge for it for Allah’s sake.
4786 | `A’isha said:the Messenger of Allah (saws ) never struck a servant or a woman.

4789 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      A man who had the mark of yellowness on him came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The apostle of Allah (ﷺ) rarely mentioned anything of a man which he disliked before him. When he went out, he said: Would that you asked him to wash it from him.

Arafat to the visibility of moon, but he did not accept his witness.

He replied: The one who will have the worst position in Allah’s estimation on the Day of Resurrection will be the one whom people left alone for fear of his ribaldry.
4792 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      A man asked permission  to see the Prophet (ﷺ), and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: He is a bad member of the tribe. When he entered, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) treated in a frank and friendly way and spoke to him. When he departed , I said: Messenger of Allah! When he asked permission, you said: He is a bad member of the tribe, but when he entered, you treated him in a frank and friendly way. The Messenger of Allah replied: Aisha! Allah does not like the one who is unseemly and lewd in his language.

4795 | `Abd Allah b. ‘Umar said:The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by a man of the Ansar when he was giving his brother a warning against modesty. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said : Leave him alone, for modesty is a part of faith.

Hussain reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Modesty is good altogether, or he said: Modesty is altogether good. Bushair b. Ka`b said : We find in some books that there  is a modesty which produces peace and dignified bearing, and there is a modesty which produces weakness. `Imran b. Hussain repeated the same words. So `Imran became angry so much so that his eyes became red, and he said : Don’t you see that I am transmitting a tradition from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and you are mentioning something from your books? He (Qatadah) said : We said : Abu Nujaid, it is sufficient.

4806 | Narrated Abdullah ibn ash-Shikhkhir:      I went with a deputation of Banu Amir to the apostle of Allah (ﷺ), and we said: You are our lord (sayyid).

Once he intended to go to the desert and he sent to me a she-camel from the camel of sadaqah which had not been used for riding so far. He said to me: Aisha! show gentleness, for if gentleness is found in anything, it beautifies it and when it is taken out from anything it damages it.

He who praises him for it, thanks him, and he who conceals it is ungrateful to him.   Abu Dawud said: It has been transmitted by Yahya b. Ayyub, from `Umarah b. Ghaziyyah, from Sharahbil on the authority of Jabir.   Abu Dawud said: In the chain of this tradition `Umarah b. Ghaziyyah said: A man from my tribe said. The man referred by him is Sharahbil.

When he turned his back, I recalled the words of the Prophet (ﷺ). So I rode my camel and galloped without stopping. When I reached al-Asafir, he was pursuing me with a group of men. So I galloped and forged ahead of him. When he saw me that I had outstripped him, they returned and he came to me.        He said to me: I had some work with my people.  I said: Yes.

He (Allah) said to this man who had striven hard in worship; Had you knowledge about Me or had you power over that which I had in My hand?

Tell me about this prayer: Is it obligatory or supererogatory?        He said: It is obligatory; it is the prayer performed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I did not make a mistake except in one thing that I forgot.        He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say: Do not impose austerities on yourselves so that austerities will be imposed on you, for people have imposed austerities on themselves and Allah imposed austerities on them. Their survivors are to be found in cells and monasteries. (Then he quoted:) "Monasticism, they invented it; we did not prescribe it for them."        Next day he went out in the morning and said: will you not go out for a ride, so that you may see something and take a lesson from it?        He said: Yes. Then all of them rode away and reached a land whose inhabitants had perished, passed away and died. The roofs of the town had fallen in.        He asked: Do you know this land?  I said: Who acquainted me with it and its inhabitants?  (Anas said:) This is the land of the people whom oppression and envy destroyed. Envy extinguishes the light of good deeds, and oppression confirms or falsifies it. The eye commits fornication, and the palm of the hand, the foot, body, tongue and private part of the body confirm it or deny it.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If you were not to give him anything, a lie would be recorded against you.
4992 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: It is enough falsehood for a man to relate everything he hears.    Abu Dawud said: Hafs did not mention Abu Hurairah (in his version).   Abu Dawud said: No other transmitter except this old man, that is, 'Ali b. Hafs al-Mada'ini related the perfect chain of this tradition.
4993 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: To harbour good thoughts is a part of well-conducted worship. (This is according to Nasr's version).   Abu Dawud said: Mahna' is reliable and he is from Basrah.
4994 | Safiyyah said :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was in the I’TIKAF(seclusion in the mosque). I came to visit him at night . I talked to him, got up and turned my back. He got up with me to accompany me. He was living in the house of Usamah b. Zaid. Two men of the Ansar passed by him. When they saw the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him), they walked quickly. The prophet (May peace be upon him) said: Be at ease; she is Safiyyah daughter of Huyayy. They said: Glory be to Allah, Messenger of Allah! He said: The devil flows in man as the blood flows in him. I feared that he might inject something in your hearts, or he said “evil” (instead of something).
4995 | Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When a man makes a promise to his brother with the intention of fulfilling it and does not do so, and does not come at the appointed time, he is guilty of no sin.
4996 | Narrated Abdullah ibn AbulHamsa':      I bought something from the Prophet (ﷺ) before he received his Prophetic commission, and as there was something still due to him I promised him that I would bring it to him at his place, but I forgot. When I remembered three days later, I went to that place and found him there. He said: You have vexed me, young man. I have been here for three days waiting for you.    Abu Dawud said: Muhammad b. Yahya said : This is, in our opinion, 'Abd al-Karim b. 'Abd Allah b. Shaqiq (instead of "from 'Abd al-Karim from 'Abd Allah b. Shaqiq").    Abu Dawud said: In a similar way I have been informed by 'Ali b. 'Abd Allah.   Abu Dawud said: I have been told that Bishr b. al-Sarri transmitted it from 'Abd Allah b. Shaqiq.
4997 | Asma’, daughter of Abu Bakr, told of a woman who said :Messenger of Allah! I have a fellow-wife; will it be wrong for me to boast of receiving from my husband what he does not give me? He replied: the one who boasts of receiving what he has not been given is like him who has put on two garments of falsehood.
4998 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah! give me a mount. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: We shall give you a she-camel's child  to ride on.

4999 | Narrated An-Nu'man ibn Bashir:      When AbuBakr asked the permission of the Prophet (ﷺ) to come in, he heard Aisha speaking in a loud voice.        So when he entered, he caught hold of her in order to slap her, and said: Do I see you raising your voice to the Messenger of Allah? The Prophet (ﷺ) began to prevent him and AbuBakr went out angry. The Prophet (ﷺ) said when AbuBakr went out: You see I rescued you from the man.        AbuBakr waited for some days, then asked permission of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to enter, and found that they had made peace with each other. He said to them: Bring me into your peace as you brought me into your war.        The Prophet (ﷺ) said: We have done so: we have done so.
5000 | ‘Awf b. Malik al-Ashja’i said :I came to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) at the expedition to Tabuk when he was in a small skin tent. I gave him a salutation and he returned it, saying: come in. I asked : the whole of me Messenger of Allah? He replied : The whole of you. So I entered.
5001 | ‘Uthman b. Abu 'Atikah said :The only reason why he asked whether the whole of him should come in was because of the smallness of the tent
5002 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) addressed me as: O you with the two ears.
5003 | Narrated Abdullah ibn as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: None of you should take the property of his brother in amusement (i.e. jest), nor in earnest. The narrator Sulayman said: Out of amusement and out of earnest. If anyone takes the staff of his brother, he should return it. The transmitter Ibn Bashshar did not say "Ibn Yazid, and he said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said.
5004 | Narrated AbdurRahman ibn AbuLayla:      The Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) told us that they were travelling with the Prophet (ﷺ). A man of them slept, and one of them went to the rope which he had with him. He took it, by which he was frightened. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: It is not lawful for a Muslim that he frightens a Muslim.
5005 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah , the Exalted, hates the eloquent one among men who moves his tongue round (among his teeth), as cattle do.
5006 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: On the Day of resurrection Allah will not accept repentance or ransom from him who learns excellence of speech to captivate thereby the hearts of men, or of people.
5007 | ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Umar said :When two men who came from the east made a speech and the people were charmed with their eloquence, the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: In some eloquent speech there is magic.
5008 | One day when a man got up and spoke at length Amr ibn al-'As said If he had been moderate in what he said:It would have been better for him. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: I think (or, I have been commanded) that I should be brief in what I say, for brevity is better.
5009 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :it is better for a man’s belly to be full of pus than to be full of poetry.    Abu ‘Ali said : I have been told that Abu ‘Ubaid said : It means that his heart is full of poetry so much so that it makes him neglectful of the Quran and remembrance of Allah. If the Quran and the knowledge (of religion) are dominant, the belly will not be full of poetry in our opinion. Some eloquent speech is magic. It means that a man expresses his eloquence by praising another man, and he speaks the truth about him so much so that he attracts the hearts to his speech. He then condemns him and speaks the truth about him so much so that he attracts the hearts to another of his speech, as if he spelled the audience by it.
5010 | Ubayy b. Ka’b reported the Prophet (May peace be upon him) as saying :In poetry there is wisdom.
5011 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:      A desert Arab came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and began to speak. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: In eloquence there is magic and in poetry there is wisdom.
5012 | Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:      I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: In eloquence there is magic, in knowledge ignorance, in poetry wisdom, and in speech heaviness.        Sa'sa'ah ibn Suhan said: The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) spoke the truth. His statement "In eloquence there is magic" means: (For example), there is a right due from a man who is more eloquent in reasoning than the man who is demanding his right. He (the defendant) charms the people by his speech and takes away his right. His statement "In knowledge there is ignorance" means: A scholar brings to his knowledge what he does not know, and thus he becomes ignorant of that. His statement "In poetry there is wisdom" means: These are the sermons and examples by which people receive admonition. His statement "In speech there is heaviness" means: That you present your speech and your talk to a man who is not capable of understanding it, and who does not want it.
5013 | Sa'id said:Umar passed by Hassan when he was reciting verses in the mosque. He looked at him. Thereupon he said: I used to recite verses when there was present in it the one who was better than you (i.e. the Prophet).
5014 | The tradition mention above has also been transmitted by Sa’id b. al-Musayyab through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. This version adds:so he (‘Umar’) feared that he would refer to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him); therefore he allowed him.
5015 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to setup a pulpit in the mosque for Hassan who would stand on it and satirise those who spoke against the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would say: The spirit of holiness (i.e. Gabriel) is with Hassan so long as he speaks in defence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
5016 | Ibn ‘Abbas said :The verse “And the poets it is those straying in evil who follow them. He (Allah) then abrogated it and made an exception saying: Except those who believe and work righteousness, engage much in the remembrance of Allah."
5017 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished the dawn prayer, he would ask: Did any of you have a dream last night? And he said: All that is left of Prophecy after me is a good vision.
5018 | ‘Ubadah b. al-Samit reported the Prophet (May peace be upon him) as saying :A believer’s vision is the forty-sixth part of Prophecy.
5019 | Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet (May peace be upon him) as saying:When the time draws near, a believer’s vision can hardly be false. The truer one of them is in his speech, the truer he is in his vision. Visions are of three types: Good visions are glad tidings from Allah, a terrifying vision caused by the devil, and the ideas which come from within a man. So when one sees anything he dislikes, he should get up and pray, and should not tell it to the people. He said : I like a fetter and dislike a shackle on the neck; a fetter indicates being firmly established in religion.   Abu Dawud said : “when the time draws near” means that when the day and night are equal.
5020 | Narrated AbuRazin:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The vision flutters over a man as long as it is not interpreted , but when it is interpreted, it settles. And I think he said: Tell it only to one who loves (i.e. friend) or one who has judgment.
5021 | Abu Qatadah said:I heard the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) say: A good vision comes from Allah and a dream (hulm) from the devil, so when one of you sees what he dislikes, he must spit on his left (three times), and seek refuge in Allah from its evil. It will then not harm him.
5022 | Jabir reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :When one of you sees a vision which he dislikes, he must spit on his left (three times), seek refuge in Allah from the devil three times, and turn from the side on which he was lying.
5023 | Abu Hurairah said :I heard the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) say : He who sees me in a dream will see me when awake or as if he will see me when awake, for the devil does not take my likeness.
5024 | Ibn ‘Abbas reported the Prophet (ﷺ) as saying :If anyone makes a representation of anything, Allah will punish him on the Day of Resurrection for it until he breathes into it, but he will be unable to do so. If anyone pretends to have had a dream which he did not see, he will be ordered to tie a knot in a grain of barley. If anyone listens to other people’s talk when they try to avoid him, lead will be poured into his ears on the Day of Resurrection.
5025 | Narrated Anas ibn Malik:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: One night it seemed to me in a dream that we were in the house of Uqbah ibn Rafi' and were brought some of the fresh dates of Ibn tab. I interpreted it as meaning that to us is granted eminence (rif'ah) in this world, a blessed hereafter ('aqibah), and that our religion has been good (tabah).
5026 | Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying:When one of you yawns, he should hold his hand over his mouth, for the devil enters.
5027 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted in a similar way by Suhail through a different chain of  narrators. This version has; “during prayer, so he should hold as far as possible”.
5028 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying:Allah likes sneezing but dislikes yawning. So when one of you yawns, he should restrain it as much as possible, and should not say Ha, Ha, for that is from the devil who laughs at him.
5029 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sneezed, he placed his hand or a garment on his mouth, and lessened the noise. The transmitter Yahya is doubtful about the exact words khafada or ghadda (lessened).
5030 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying:There are five qualities which a Muslim should display to his brother : return of salutation, response to the one who sneezes, acceptance of the invitation, paying sick visit to a patient, and accompanying the funeral.
5031 | Narrated Salim ibn Ubayd:      Hilal ibn Yasar said: We were with Salim ibn Ubayd when a man from among the people sneezed and said: Peace be upon you.        Salim said: And upon you and your mother. Later he said: Perhaps you found something (annoying) in what I said to you.        He said: I wished you would not mention my mother with good or evil.  He said: I have just said to you what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said. We were in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when a man from among the people sneezed, saying: Peace be upon you!        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: And upon you and your mother. He then said: When one of you sneezes, he should praise Allah. He further mentioned some attributes (of Allah), saying: The one who is with him should say to him: Allah have mercy on you, and he should reply to them: Allah forgive us and you.
5032 | Narrated Salim ibn Ubayd al-Ashja'i:      The tradition mentioned above (No. 5013) has also been mentioned by Salim ibn Ubayd al-Ashja'i to the same effect from the Prophet (ﷺ) through a different chain of narrators.
5033 | Abu Hurairah reported the prophet (May peace be upon him) as saying:When one of you sneezes, he should say: "Praise be to Allah in every circumstance," and his brother or his companion should say: "May Allah have mercy on you!" And he should then reply: "May Allah guide you and set right your affairs."
5034 | Narrated AbuHurayrah:      Respond three times to your brother when he sneezes, and if he sneezes more often, he has a cold in his head.
5035 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Abu Hurairah through a different chain from the prophet (May peace be upon him). A transmitter Sa’id b. Sa’id said:I know him that he traced this tradition back to the prophet (May peace be upon him).   Abu Dawud said: Abu Nu’aim transmitted it from Musa b. Qais, from Muhammad b. Ajlan, from Sa’id, on the authority of Abu Hurairah, from the prophet (May peace be upon him).
5036 | Narrated Ubayd ibn Rifa'ah az-Zuraqi:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Invoke a blessing on one who sneezes three times; (and if he sneezes more often), then if you wish to invoke a blessing on him, you may invoke, and if you wish (to stop), then stop.
5037 | Salamah b. al-Akwa said :when a man sneezed beside the prophet (May peace be upon him), he said to him : Allah have mercy on you, but when he sneezed again, he said : The man has a cold in the head.
5038 | Narrated AbuBurdah:      The Jews used to try to sneezes in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ) hoping that he would say to them: "Allah have mercy on you!" but he would say: May Allah guide you and grant you well-being!
5039 | Anas said:Two men sneezed in the presence of the prophet (May peace be upon him). He said : Allah have mercy on you! To one and not to the other. He was asked: Messenger of Allah! Two persons sneezed. Ahmad’s version has: You invoked a blessing on one of them and left the other. He replied : This man praised Allah, and this man did not praise Allah.
5040 | Narrated Tikhfat al-Ghifari:      Ya'ish ibn Tikhfat al-Ghifari said: My father was one of the people in the Suffah.        The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Come with us to the house of Aisha. So we went and he said: Give us food, Aisha. She brought hashishah and we ate. He then said: Give us food, Aisha. She then brought haysah as small in quantity as a pigeon and we ate. He then said: Give us something to drink, Aisha. So she brought a bowl of milk, and we drank. Again he said: Give us something to drink, Aisha. She then brought a small cup and we drank. He then said: If you wish, you may spend the night (here), or if you wish, you may go to the mosque.        He said: While I was lying on my stomach because of pain in the lung, a man began to shake me with his foot and then said: This is a method of lying which Allah hates. I looked and saw that he was the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
5041 | Narrated Ali ibn Shayban:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone spends the night on the roof of a house with no stone palisade, Allah's responsibility to guard him no longer applies.
5042 | Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If a Muslim sleeps while remembering Allah, in the state of purification, is alarmed while asleep at night, and asks Allah for good in this world and in the Hereafter. He surely gives it to him. Thabit al-Bunani said: AbuZabyah came to visit us and he transmitted this tradition to us from Mu'adh ibn Jabal from the Prophet (ﷺ). Thabit said: So and so said: I tried my best to utter these (prayers) when I got up, but I could not do.
5043 | Ibn ‘Abbas said:The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) got up at night, fulfilled his need and washed his face and hand and then slept.   Abu Dawud said: that is to say, he urinated
5044 | Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:      Some relative of Umm Salamah said: The bed of the Prophet (ﷺ) was set as a man is laid in his grave; the mosque was towards his head.
5045 | Narrated Hafsah, Ummul Mu'minin:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wanted to go to sleep, he put his right hand under his cheek and would then say three times: O Allah, guard me from Thy punishment on the day when Thou raisest up Thy servants.
5046 | Al-Bara b. ‘Azib said :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said to me: When you go to your bed, perform ablution like the ablution for prayer, and then lie on your right side and say: O Allah I have handed over my face to thee, entrusted my affairs to thee, and committed my back to thee out of desire for and fear to thee. There is no refuge and no place of safety from thee except by having recource to thee. I believe in Thy Book which Thou hast sent down and in Thy prophet whom thou hast sent down. He said : If you die (that night), you would die in the true religion, and utter these words in the last of that you utter (other prayers). Al-Bara said : I said: I memorise them, and then I repeated, saying “and in Thy Apostle whom Thou hast sent”. He said : No, say : “and in Thy Prophet whom Thou hast sent.
5047 | Al-Bara b. Azib said :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said to me: when you go to bed while you are in the state of purification, lay your head on your right hand. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition in a similar manner as above.
5048 | The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by al-Bara b. Azil from the prophet (May peace be upon him) to the same effect through a different chain of narrators. One transmitter said:when you go to your bed while you are in the state of purification. The other said: Perform ablution like the ablution for prayer. He then transmitted the tradition to the effect as Mu’tamir transmitted.
5049 | Hudhaifah said :when the prophet (May peace be upon him) lay down on his bed (at night), he would say: O Allah! In Thy name I die and live. When he awoke, he said: praise be to Allah who has given us life after causing us to die and to whom we shall be resurrected.
5050 | Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying:when any of you goes to his bed, he should dust his bedding with the inner extremity of his lower garment, for he does not know what has come on it since he left it. He should then lie down on his right side and say: In Thy name, my mercy on it, but if Thou lettest it go, guard it with that which Thou guardest Thy upright servants.
5051 | Abu Hurairah said:when the prophet (May peace be upon him) went to his bed, he used to say : O Allah! Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth, Lord of everything, who splittest the grain and the kernel, who hast sent down the Torah, forelock Thou seizes. Thou art the first and there is nothing before thee; Thou art the Last and there is nothing after Thee; Thou art the Outward and there is nothing above Thee; Thou art the Inward and there is nothing below Thee. Wahb added in his version : pay the debt for me and grant me riches instead of  poverty.
5052 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say when he lay down: O Allah, I seek refuge in Thy noble Person and in Thy perfect Words from the evil of what Thou seizest by its forelock; O Allah!

5053 | Anas said:When the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) went to his bed, he would say: Praise be to Allah who has fed us, given us drink, satisfied us and given us refuge. Many there are who have no one to provide sufficiency for them, or give them refuge.
5054 | Narrated AbulAzhar al-Anmari:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went to his bed at night, he would say: in the name of Allah, I have laid down my side for Allah. O Allah! forgive me my sin, drive away my devil, free me from my responsibility, and place me in the highest assembly.     Abu Dawud said: Abu Hammam al-Ahwazi transmitted it from Thawr. He mentioned Abu Zuhair al-Anmari (instead of Abu al-Azhar).
5055 | Farwah b. Nawfal quoted his father as saying that the Prophet (ﷺ) said to Nawfal (his father):Recite (the Surah) 'Say, O you disbelievers!' and then go to sleep at its end, for it is a declaration of freedom from polytheism.

Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and then he prays: O my Lord, forgive me. Abu Dawud said : Al-Walid’s version has; and he prays, his prayer will be answered. If he gets up, performs ablution, and prays, his prayer will be accepted.
5061 | Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:      When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) awake at night, he said: There is no god but thou, glory be to Thee, O Allah, I ask Thy pardon for my sin and I ask Thee for Thy mercy.

5062 | Ali said :Fatimah complained to the Prophet (May peace be upon him) of the effect of the grinding stone on her hand. Then some slaves (prisoners of war) were brought to him. So she went to him to ask for (one of) them, but she did not find him. She mentioned the matter to ‘A’ishah. When the prophet (May peace be upon him) came, she informed him. He (the prophet) visited us (Ali) when we had gone to bed, and when we were about to get up, he said: stay where you are. He then came and sat down between us (her and me), and I felt the coldness of his feet on my chest. He then said; “Let me guide to something better than what you have asked. When you go bed, say: Glory be to Allah” thirty-three times.”Praise be to Allah” thirty-three times, and “ Allah is most Great” thirty-four times. That will be better for you than a servant.
5063 | ‘Ali said to Ibn A’bad :should I not tell you about me and about Fatimah, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him). She was dearest to him of his family. When she was with me, she pulled mill-stone which affected her hand; she carried water with the water-bag which affected the upper portion of her chest: She swept the house so much so that her clothes became dusty; and she cooked food by which her clothes became black, and it harmed her. We heard that some slaves had been brought to the prophet (May peace be upon him). I said: if you go to your father and ask him for a servant, that will be sufficient for you. She came to him and found some people talking to him. She felt shy and returned. Next morning he visited us when we were in our quilt. He sat beside her head, and she took her head into the quilt out of shame from her father. He asked: What need had you with me, O family of Muhammad? She kept silence twice. I then said : I swear by Allah, I shall tell you. She pulls the mile-stone which has  affected her hand; she carrys water with the water-bag which has affected the upper portion of her chest; she sweeps the house by which her clothes have become dusty, and she cooks food by which her clothes have become black. We were told that some slaves or servants had come to you. So I said to her; ask him for a servant. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition to the same effect as mentioned by al-Hakam rather more perfectly.
5064 | Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:      The tradition (No 5045, about Tasbih Fatimah) has been transmitted by Ali to the same effect through a different chain of narrators.       This version adds: Ali said: I did not leave them (Tasbih Fatimah) since I heard them from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) except on the night of Siffin, for I remembered them towards  the end of the night and then I uttered them.
5065 | Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There are two qualities or characteristics which will not be returned by any Muslim without his entering Paradise. While they are easy, those who act upon them are few. One should say: "Glory be to Allah" ten times after every prayer, "Praise be to Allah" ten times and "Allah is Most Great" ten times. That is a hundred and fifty on the tongue, but one thousand and five hundred on the scale. When he goes to bed, he should say: "Allah is Most Great" thirty-four times, "Praise be to Allah" thirty-three times, and Glory be to Allah thirty-three times, for that is a hundred on the tongue and a thousand on the scale. (He said:) I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) counting them on his hand.        The people asked: Messenger of Allah! How is it that while they are easy, those who act upon them are few?        He replied: The Devil comes to one of you when he goes to bed and he makes him sleep, before he utters them, and he comes to him while he is engaged in prayer and calls a need to his mind before he utters them.
5066 | Umm al-Hakam or Duba’ah, daughter of al-Zubair, said :The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) got some prisoners of war (slaves). I my sister and Fatimah, daughter of the prophet (May peace be upon him), went to the prophet (May peace be upon him). We complained to him about our condition, and asked him to command for giving us some prisoners (slaves). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said; The orphans of Badr came before you (and took the slaves). The transmitter then mentioned the story of glorifying Allah after every prayer. He did not mention sleeping.

O Allah! I ask thee for the good of what this night contains, and the good of what comes after it; and I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of what this night contains, and from the evil of what comes after it. My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from indolence, the evil of old age or of disbelief. My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from a punishment in Hell and a punishment in the grave. In the morning he said that also: we have come to the morning, and in the morning the dominion belongs to Allah.   Abu Dawud said: Shu’bah transmitted from Salamah b. Kuhail, from Ibrahim b. Suwaid, saying: from the evil of old age. He did not mention the evil of disbelief.

Ali and Ibn al-Musaffa said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent us on an expedition. When we reached the place of attack, I galloped my horse and outstripped my companions, and the people of that locality received me with a great noise.        I said to them: Say "There is no god but Allah," and you will be protected. They said this.        My companions blamed me, saying: You deprived us of the booty. When we came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), they told him what I had done.        So he called me, appreciating what I had done, and said: Allah has recorded for you so and so (a reward) for every man of them.        AbdurRahman said: I forgot the reward.  The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: I shall write a will for you after me. He did this and stamped it, and gave it to me, saying....He then mentioned the rest of the tradition to the same effect.

5083 | Narrated AbuMalik:      The people asked: Tell us a word which we repeat in the morning, evening and when we rise.        So he commanded us to say: "O Allah! Creator of Heavens and Earth; Knower of all that is hidden and open; Thou art the Lord of everything; the angels testify that there is no god but Thee, for we seek refuge in Thee from the evil within ourselves, from the evil of the Devil accused and from the evil of his suggestion about partnership with Allah, and that we earn sin for ourselves or drag it to a Muslim."
5084 | AbuDawud said:And through the same chain of transmitters the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: When one rises in the morning, one should say: "We have reached the morning, and in the morning the dominion belongs to Allah, the Lord of the universe. O Allah! I ask Thee for the good this day contains, for conquest, victory, light, blessing and guidance during it; and I seek refuge in Thee from the evil it contains and the evil contained in what comes after it."

Aban was afflicted by some paralysis and when a man who heard the tradition began to look at him, he said to him: Why are you looking at me? I swear by Allah, I did not tell a lie about Uthman, nor did Uthman tell a lie about the Prophet (ﷺ), but that day when I was afflicted by it, I became angry and forgot to say them.

He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) using these words as a supplication and I like to follow his practice.        The transmitter, Abbas, said in this version: And you say: "O Allah! I seek refuge in Thee from infidelity and poverty. O Allah! I seek refuge in Thee from punishment in the grave. There is no god but Thee". You repeat them three times in the morning and three times in the evening, and use them as a supplication. I like to follow his practice.

5096 | Narrated AbuMalik Al-Ash'ari:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When a man goes into his house, he should say: "O Allah!

Qays said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Ride. But I refused. He again said: Either ride or go away. He said: So I went away.

5192 | Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:      Ikrimah said: A group of people from Iraq said: Ibn Abbas, what is your opinion about the verse in which we have been commanded whatever we have been commanded, but no one acts upon it?

Let those whom your right hands possess, and the (children) among you, who have not come of age, ask your permission (before) they enter your presence on three occasions: before morning prayer, while you are undressing for the noonday heat, and after late-night prayer. These are your three times of undress; outside those times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about."        Al-Qa'nabi recited the verse up to "full of knowledge and wisdom".        Ibn Abbas said: Allah is Most Clement and Most Merciful to the believers. He loves concealment. The people had neither curtains nor curtained canopies in their houses. Sometimes a servant, a child or a female orphan of a man entered while the man was having sexual intercourse with his wife. So Allah commanded them to ask permission in those times of undress. Then Allah brought them curtains and all good things. But I did not see anyone following it after that.     Abu Dawud said: The tradition of 'Ubaid Allah and of 'Ata, weakens this tradition.

He said to him: You have two characteristics which Allah likes: gentleness and deliberation.        He asked: Have I acquired them or has Allah has created (them) my nature?

I said: Peace, Allah's mercy and His blessings be upon you! The time of departure has come.        He said: Yes. He then said: Rise, Bilal. He jumped out from beneath a gum-acacia tree and its shade was like that of a bird.        He said: I am at your service and at your pleasure, and I make myself a sacrifice for you.        He said: Put the saddle on the horse for me. He then took out a saddle, both sides of which were stuffed with palm-leaves; it showed no arrogance and pride. So he rode and we also rode.

When its owner came and gave him a greeting among the people, he turned away from him. When he had done this several times, the man realised that he was the cause of the anger and the rebuff.        So he complained about it to his companions, saying: I swear by Allah that I cannot understand the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).        They said: He went out and saw your domed building. So the man returned to it and demolished it, levelling it to the ground. One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out and did not see it.        He asked: What has happened to the domed building?        They replied: Its owner complained to us about your rebuff, and when we informed him about it, he demolished it.

5243 | Narrated AbuDharr:      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: In the morning alms are due from every bone in man's fingers and toes.  Salutation to everyone he meets is alms; enjoining good is alms; forbidding what is disreputable is alms; removing what is harmful from the road is alms; having sexual intercourse with his wife is alms. The people asked: He fulfils his desire, Messenger of Allah; is  it alms? He replied: Tell me if he fulfilled his desire where he had no right, would he commit a sin ? He then said: Two rak'ahs which one prays in the forenoon serve instead of all that.   Abu Dawud said: Hammad did not mention enjoining good and forbidding what is disreputable.

Salim said: ‘Abd Allah(b. ‘Umar) used to kill every snake which he found. Abu Lubabah or Zaid b. al-Khattab saw him chasing a snake. He said: He(the Prophet) prohibited house-snakes.

The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) gave him permission and ordered him to take his weapon with him. He came to his house and found his wife standing at the door of the house. When he pointed to her with the lance, she said; do not make haste till you see what has brought me out. He entered the house and found an ugly snake there. He pierced in the lance while it was quivering. He said : I do not know which of them died first, the man or the snake. His people then came to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and said: supplicate Allah to restore our companion to life for us. He said : Ask forgiveness for your Companion.
