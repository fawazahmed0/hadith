1 | Abū Bakr ibn Abī Shaybah narrated to us that Ghundar narrated to us, on authority of Shu’bah; and Muhammad bin ul-Muthannā and Ibn Bashār both narrated to us, they said:Muhammad bin Ja’far narrated to us, Shu’bah narrated to us, on authority of Mansūr, on authority of Rab’iy ibn Hirāsh, that he heard Alī, may Allah be pleased with him, giving a Khutbah and he said that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah upon him, said: ‘Do not lie upon me; indeed whoever lies upon me will enter the Fire’.
2 | Zuhayr bin Harb narrated to me, Ismā’īl, rather, Ibn Ulayyah narrated to us, on authority of Abd il-Azīz ibn Suhayb, on authority of Anas bin Mālik, that he said:‘Indeed what prevents me from relating to you a great number of Ḥadīth is that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah upon him, said: ‘Whoever intends to lie upon me, then let him take his seat in the Fire.’
3 | Muhammad bin Ubayd il-Ghubarī narrated to us, Abū Awānah narrated to us, on authority of Abī Hasīn, on authority of Abī Sālih, on authority of Abū Hurayrah, he said, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah upon him, said:‘Whoever lies upon me intentionally, then let him take his seat in the Fire’.
4 | Muhammad bin Abd Allah ibn Numayr narrated to us, my father narrated to us, Sa’īd bin Ubayd narrated to us, Alī bin Rabī’ah narrated to us, he said:‘I arrived at the Masjid and al-Mughīrah, the Amīr of al-Kūfah said: ‘I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah upon him, saying, ‘Indeed a lie upon me is not like a lie upon anyone else, for whoever lies upon me intentionally, then he shall take his seat in the Fire’.’
4 | ’ Alī bin Hujr as-Sa’dī narrated to us, Alī bin Mushir narrated to us, Muhammad bin Qays il-Asadī informed us, on authority of Alī ibn Rabī’at al-Asadī, on authority of al-Mughīrat ibn Shu’bah, on authority of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah upon him a similar narration, however he did not mention the words ‘Indeed a lie upon me is not like a lie upon anyone else’.
5 | Ubayd Allah bin Mu’ādh al-Anbarī narrated to us, my father narrated to us; and Muhammad bin ul-Muthannā narrated to us, Abd ur-Rahman bin Mahdī both narrated to us:Shu’bah narrated to us, on authority of Khubayb bin Abd ir-Rahman, on authority of Hafs bin Āsim, on authority of Abī Hurayrah, he said, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah upon him, said: ‘It is enough of a lie for a man to narrate everything he hears’.
6 | Muhammad bin Abd Allah bin Numayr and Zuhayr bin Harb narrated to me, they said Abd Allah bin Yazīd narrated to us, he said Sa’īd bin Abī Ayyūb narrated to me, he said Abū Hāni’ narrated to me, on authority of Uthmān Muslim bin Yasār, on authority of Abī Hurayrah, on authority of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah upon him, he said:‘There will be in the last of my nation a people narrating to you what you nor your fathers heard, so beware of them’. ,Harmalah bin Yahyā bin Abd Allah bin Harmalah bin Imrān at-Tujībī narrated to me, he said Ibn Wahb narrated to us, he said Abū Shurayh narrated to me that he heard Sharāhīl bin Yazīd saying ‘Muslim bin Yasār informed me that he heard Abā Hurayrah saying, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah upon him, said:‘There will be in the end of time charlatan liars coming to you with narrations that you nor your fathers heard, so beware of them lest they misguide you and cause you tribulations’.’
8.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur that the first man who discussed qadr (Divine Decree) in Basra was Ma'bad al-Juhani. I along with Humaid b. 'Abdur-Rahman Himyari set out for pilgrimage or for 'Umrah and said:Should it so happen that we come into contact with one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him about what is talked about taqdir (Divine Decree). Accidentally we came across Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) on his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my companion would authorize me to speak. I therefore said: Abu Abdur Rahman! There have appeared some people in our land who recite the Qur'an and pursue knowledge. And then after talking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that there is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not predestined. He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no way responsible for my (belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and spent it (in the way of Allah), Allah would not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we were sitting in the company of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him. None amongst us recognized him. At last he sat with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed his palms on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and you establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the expense of) the journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he would put the question and then he would himself verify the truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about good and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (the inquirer) again said: Inform me about al-Ihsan (performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see Him, He, verily, sees you. He (the enquirer) again said: Inform me about the hour (of the Doom). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: One who is asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring (about it). He (the inquirer) said: Tell me some of its indications. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and master, that you will find barefooted, destitute goat-herds vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings. He (the narrator, Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: Then he (the inquirer) went on his way but I stayed with him (the Holy Prophet) for a long while. He then, said to me: Umar, do you know who this inquirer was? I replied: Allah and His Apostle knows best. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He was Gabriel (the angel). He came to you in order to instruct you in matters of religion.
8.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur that when Ma'bad discussed the problem pertaining to Divine Decree, we refuted that. He (the narrator) said:I and Humaid b. Abdur-Rahman Himyari argued. And they carried on the conversation about the purport of the hadith related by Kahmas and its chain of transmission too, and there is some variation of words.
8.03 | It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur and Humaid b. 'Abdur-Rahman that they said:We met Abdullah b. 'Umar and we discussed about the Divine Decree, and what they talked about it and he narrated the hadith that has been transmitted by 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Apostle (ﷺ). There is a slight variation in that.
8.04 | The same hadith is mentioned through a different chain.
8.05 | Abu Huraira reported:One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) appeared before the public so a man came to him and then said: Prophet of Allah, what is Iman? Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, His angels, His Books, His meeting, His Messengers and that you affirm your faith in the Resurrection hereafter. He said: Messenger of Allah, what is al-Islam? He replied: Al-Islam is that you worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him and you establish obligatory prayer and you pay the obligatory alms (Zakat) and you observe the fast of Ramadan. He said: Messenger of Allah, what is al-Ihsan? He replied: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, and for if you fail to see Him. He said: Messenger of Allah, when is the Hour (of Doom)? He replied: The one who is asked about it is no better informed than the inquirer, however I will narrate some of its signs to you. When the slave-girl will give birth to her master, then that is from its signs. When the naked, barefooted would become the chiefs of the people, then that is from its signs. When the shepherds of the black (camels) would exult themselves in buildings, then that is from its signs. (The Hour is) Among one of the five which no one knows but Allah. Then he recited (the verse): "Verily Allah! with Him alone is the knowledge of the Hour and He it is Who sends down the rain and knows that which is in the wombs. And no soul knows what it shall earn tomorrow, and a soul knows not in what land it shall die. Verily Allah is Knowing, Aware." He (Abu Huraira) said: Then the person turned back and went away. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Bring that man back to me. They went to bring him back, but they saw nothing there. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: he was Gabriel, who came to teach the people their religion.
9 | This hadith is narrated to us on the authority of Muhammad b. 'Abdullah b. Numair, on the authority of Muhammad b. Bishr, on the authority of Abd Hayyan al-Taymi with the exception that in this narration (instead of the words (Iza Waladat al'amah rabbaha), the words are (Iza Waladat al'amah Ba'laha), i, e, when slave-girl gives birth to her master.
10 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Ask me (about religious matters), but they (the Companions) were in awe of asking him. Then came a man, and sat near his knees and said: O Messenger of Allah, what is al-Islam? So he (the Holy Prophet) replied: [That] you do not associate anything with Allah, and establish the prayer, pay the alms (Zakat) and fast Ramadan. He said: You (have) told the truth. He said: Messenger of Allah, what is al-Iman (Faith)? He said: That you affirm your faith in Allah, His angels, His Books, His meeting, His Apostles, and that you believe in Resurrection and that you believe in Qadr (Divine Decree) in all its entirety. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He said: Messenger of Allah, what is al-Ihsan? Upon this he said: that you fear Allah as if you are seeing Him, and though you see Him not, verily He is seeing you. He (the inquirer) said: You (have) told the truth. He (the inquirer) said: When will the Hour (of Doom) occur? He said: The one who is being asked about it is no better informed than the inquirer and I will narrate some of its signs to you. When you see a [slave] woman giving birth to her master - then that is [one] of its signs. And when you see barefooted, naked, deaf and dumb (ignorant and foolish persons) as the rulers of the earth - then that is [one] of its signs. And when you see the shepherds of black (camels) exult in buildings - then that is [one] of its signs. The (Hour) is one of the five things of the unseen. No one knows them except Allah. Then (the Holy Prophet) recited (the folowing verse):" Verily Allah! with Him alone is the knowledge of the Hour and He it is Who sends down the rain and knows that which is in the wombs. And no soul knows what it shall earn on the morrow and a soul knows not in what land it shall die. Verily Allah is Knowing, Aware." He (Abu Huraira) said: Then the person stood up (and made his way). Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Bring him back to me. He was searched for, but they could not find him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) thereupon said: He was Gabriel and he wanted to teach you when you did not ask.
11.01 | It is reported on the authority of Talha b. 'Ubaidullah that a person with dishevelled hair, one of the people of Nejd, came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We heard the humming of his voice but could not fully discern what he had been saying, till he came nigh to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). It was then (disclosed to us) that he was asking questions pertaining to Islam. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Five prayers during the day and the night. (Upon this he said: Am I obliged to say any other (prayer) besides these? He (the Holy Prophet, ) said: No, but whatever you observe voluntarily, out of your own free will, and the fasts of Ramadan. The inquirer said: Am I obliged to do anything else besides this? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No, but whatever you do out of your own free will. And the Messenger of Allah told him about the Zakat (poor-rate). The inquirer said: Am I obliged to pay anything else besides this? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No, but whatever you pay voluntarily out of your own free will. The man turned back and was saying: I would neither make any addition to this, nor will decrease anything out of it. The Prophet remarked: He is successful, if he is true to what he affirms.
11.02 | Another hadith, the like of which has been narrated by Malik (b. Anas) (and mentioned above) is also reported by Talha b. 'Ubaidullah, with the only variation that the Prophet remarked:By his father, he shall succeed if he were true (to what he professed), or: By his father, he would enter heaven if he were true (to what he professed).
12.01 | It is reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that he said:We were forbidden that we should ask anything (without the genuine need) from the Holy Prophet. It, therefore, pleased us that an intelligent person from the dwellers of the desert should come and asked him (the Holy Prophet) and we should listen to it. A man from the dwellers of the desert came (to the Holy Prophet) and said: Muhammad, your messenger came to us and told us your assertion that verily Allah had sent you (as a prophet). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He told the truth. He (the bedouin) said: Who created the heaven? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah. He (the bedouin again) said: Who created the earth? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah. He (the bedouin again) said: Who raised these mountains and who created in them whatever is created there? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah. Upon this he (the bedouin) remarked: By Him Who created the heaven and created the earth and raised mountains thereupon, has Allah (in fact) sent you? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. He (the bedouin) said: Your messenger also told us that five prayers (had been made) obligatory for us during the day and the night. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He told you the truth. He (the bedouin) said: By Him Who sent you, is it Allah Who ordered you about this (i. e. prayers)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. He (the bedouin) said: Your messenger told us that Zakat had been made obligatory in our riches. He (the Holy Prophet) said. He has told the truth. He (the bedouin) said: By Him Who sent you (as a prophet), is it Allah Who ordered you about it (Zakat)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. He (the bedouin) said: Your messenger told us that it had been made obligatory for us to fast every year during the month of Ramadan. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He has told the truth. He (the bedouin) said: By Him Who sent you (as a prophet), is it Allah Who ordered you about it (the fasts of Ramadan)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. He (the bedouin) said: Your messenger also told us that pilgrimage (Hajj) to the House (of Ka'bah) had been made obligatory for him who is able to undertake the journey to it. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. The narrator said that he (the bedouin) set off (at the conclusion of this answer, but at the time of his departure) remarked: 'By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I would neither make any addition to them nor would I diminish anything out of them. Upon this the Prophet remarked: If he were true (to what he said) he must enter Paradise.
12.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Thabit that Anas said:We were forbidden in the Holy Qur'an that we should ask about anything from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and then Anas reported the hadith in similar words.
13.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Ayyub Ansari that once during the journey of the Prophet (may peace of Allah be upon him) a bedouin appeared before him and caught hold of the nosestring of his she-camel and then said, Messenger of Allah (or Muhammad), inform me about that which takes me near to Paradise and draws me away from the Fire (of Hell). He (the narrator) said:The Prophet (ﷺ) stopped for a while and cast a glance upon his companions and then said: He was afforded a good opportunity (or he had been guided well). He (the Holy Prophet) addressing the bedouin said: (Repeat) whatever you have uttered. He (the bedouin) repeated that. Upon this the Apostle (ﷺ) remarked: The deed which can draw you near to Paradise and take you away from Hell is, that you worship Allah and associate none with Him, and you establish prayer and pay Zakat, and do good to your kin. After having uttered these words, the Prophet asked the bedouin to release the nosestring of his she-camel.
13.02 | This hadith is transmitted by Muhammad b. Hatim on the authority of Abu Ayyub Ansari.
14.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Ayyub that a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said:Direct me to a deed which draws me near to Paradise and takes me away from the Fire (of Hell). Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: You worship Allah and never associate anything with Him, establish prayer, and pay Zakat, and do good to your kin. When he turned his back, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: If he adheres to what he has been ordered to do, he would enter Paradise.
14.02 | It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that a bedouin came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said:Messenger of Allah, direct me to a deed by which I may be entitled to enter Paradise. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: You worship Allah and never associate anything with Him, establish the obligatory prayer, and pay the Zakat which is incumbent upon you, and observe the fast of Ramadan. He (the bedouin) said: By Him in Whose hand is my life, I will never add anything to it, nor will I diminish anything from it. When he (the bedouin) turned his back, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who is pleased to see a man from the dwellers of Paradise should catch a glimpse of him.
15.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Jabir that Nu'man b. Qaufal came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said:Would I enter Paradise if I say the obligatory prayers and deny myself that which is forbidden and treat that as lawful what has been made permissible (by the Shari'ah)? The Prophet (ﷺ) replied in the affirmative.
15.02 | A similar hadith is narrated on Jabir's authority in which the following words are added:I will do nothing more.
15.03 | It is narrated on the authority of Jabir that a man once said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ):Shall I enter Paradise in case I say the obligatory prayers, observe the (fasts) of Ramadan and treat that as lawful which has been made permissible (by the Shari'ah) and deny myself that what is forbidden, and make no addition to it? He (the Holy Prophet) replied in the affirmative. He (the inquirer) said: By Allah, I would add nothing to it.
16.01 | It is narrated on the authority of ('Abdullah) son of Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (may peace of Allah be upon him) said:(The superstructure of) al-Islam is raised on five (pillars), i. e. the oneness of Allah, the establishment of prayer, payment of Zakat, the, fast of Ramadan, Pilgrimage (to Mecca). A person said (to 'Abdullah b. Umar the narrator): Which of the two precedes the other-Pilgrimage or the fasts of Rarnadan? Upon this he (the narrator) replied: No (it is not the Pilgrimage first) but the fasts of Ramadan precede the Pilgrimage.
16.02 | It is narrated on the authority of ('Abdullah) son of 'Umar, that the Prophet (may peace of Allah be upon him) said:(The superstructure of) al-Islam is raised on five (pillars), i. e. Allah (alone) should be worshipped, and (all other gods) beside Him should be (categorically) denied. Establishment of prayer, the payment of Zakat, Pilgrimage to the House, and the fast of Ramadan (are the other obligatory acts besides the belief in the oneness of Allah and denial of all other gods).
16.03 | It is narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah son of 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:(The superstructure of) al-Islam is raised on five (pillars), testifying (the fact) that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is His bondsman and messenger, and the establishment of prayer, payment of Zakat, Pilgrimage to the House (Ka'ba) and the fast of Ramadan.
16.04 | It is reported on the authority of Ta'us that a man said to 'Abdullah son of 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). Why don't you carry out a military expedition? Upon which he replied:I heard the messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Verily, al-Islam is founded on five (pillars): testifying the fact that there is no god but Allah, establishment of prayer, payment of Zakat, fast of Ramadan and Pilgrimage to the House.
17.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that a delegation of Abdul Qais came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said:Messenger of Allah, verily ours is a tribe of Rabi'a and there stand between you and us the unbelievers of Mudar and we find no freedom to come to you except in the sacred month. Direct us to an act which we should ourselves perform and invite those who live beside us. Upon this the Prophet remarked: I command you to do four things and prohibit you against four acts. (The four deeds which you are commanded to do are): Faith in Allah, and then he explained it for them and said: Testifying the fact. that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, performance of prayer, payment of Zakat, that you pay Khums (one-fifth) of the booty fallen to your lot, and I prohibit you to use round gourd, wine jars, wooden pots or skins for wine. Khalaf b. Hisham has made this addition in his narration: Testifying the fact that there is no god but Allah, and then he with his finger pointed out the oneness of the Lord.
17.02 | Abu Jamra reported:I was an interpreter between Ibn Abbas and the people, that a woman happened to come there and asked about nabidh or the pitcher of wine. He replied: A delegation of the people of 'Abdul-Qais came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He (the Holy Prophet) asked the delegation or the people (of the delegation about their identity). They replied that they belonged to the tribe of Rabi'a. He (the Holy Prophet) welcomed the people or the delegation which were neither humiliated nor put to shame. They (the members of the delegation) said: Messenger of Allah, we come to you from a far-off distance and there lives between you and us a tribe of the unbelievers of Mudar and, therefore, it is not possible for us to come to you except in the sacred months. Thus direct us to a clear command, about which we should inform people beside us and by which we may enter heaven. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: I command you to do four deeds and forbid you to do four (acts), and added: I direct you to affirm belief in Allah alone, and then asked them: Do you know what belief in Allah really implies? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. The Prophet said: It implies testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, establishment of prayer, payment of Zakat, fast of Ramadan, that you pay one-fifth of the booty (fallen to your lot) and I forbid you to use gourd, wine jar, or a receptacle for wine. Shu'ba sometimes narrated the word naqir (wooden pot) and sometimes narrated it as muqayyar. The Prophet also said: Keep it in your mind and inform those who have been left behind.
17.03 | There is another hadith narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas (the contents of which are similar to the one) narrated by Shu'ba in which the Prophet (ﷺ) said:I forbid you to prepare nabidh in a gourd, hollowed block of wood, a varnished jar or receptacle. Ibn Mu'adh made this addition on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah said to Ashajj, of the tribe of 'Abdul-Qais: You possess two qualities which are liked by Allah: insight and deliberateness.
18.01 | It is reported on the authority of Qatada that one among the delegates of the 'Abdul-Qais tribe narrated this tradition to him. Sa'id said that Qatada had mentioned the name of Abu Nadra on the authority of Abu Sa'id Khudri who narrated this tradition:That people from the- tribe of 'Abdul-Qais came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, we belong to the tribe of Rabi'a and there live between you and us the unbelievers of the Mudar tribe and we find it impossible to come to you except in the sacred months; direct us to a deed which we must communicate to those who have been left behind us and by doing which we may enter heaven. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I enjoin upon you four (things) and forbid you to do four (things): worship Allah and associate none with Him, establish prayer, pay Zakat, and observe the fast of Ramadan, and pay the fifth part out of the booty. And I prohibit you from four (things): dry gourds, green-coloured jars, hollowed stumps of palm-trees, and receptacles. They (the members of the delegation) said: Do you know what al-naqir is? He replied: Yes, it is a stump which you hollow out and in which you throw small dates. Sa'id said: He (the Holy Prophet) used the word tamar (dates). (The Prophet then added): Then you sprinkle water over it and when its ebullition subsides, you drink it (and you are so intoxicated) that one amongst you, or one amongst them (the other members of your tribe, who were not present there) strikes his cousin with the sword. He (the narrator) said: There was a man amongst us who had sustained injury on this very account due to (intoxication), and he told that he tried to conceal it out of shame from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I, however, inquired from the Messenger of Allah (it we discard those utensils which you have forbidden us to use), then what type of vessels should be used for drink? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: In the waterskin the mouths of which are tied (with a string). They (again) said: Prophet of Allah, our land abounds in rats and water-skins cannot remain preserved. The holy Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) said: (Drink in water-skins) even if these arenibbled by rats. And then (addressing) al-Ashajj of 'Abdul-Qais he said: Verily, you possess two such qualities which Allah loves: insight and deliberateness.
18.02 | The above hadith has been mentioned with a different chain and slightly different wording.
18.03 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Said al-Khudri that when the delegation of the tribe of Abdul-Qais came to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ), (its members) said:Apostle of Allah, may God enable us to lay down our lives for you, which beverage is good for us? He (the Prophet) said: (Not to speak of beverages, I would lay stress) that you should not drink in the wine jars. They said: Apostle of Allah, may God enable us to lay down our lives for you, do you know what al-naqir is? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Yes, it is a stump which you hollow out in the middle, and added: Do not use gourd or receptacle (for drink). Use water-skin the mouth of which is tied with a thong (for this purpose).
19.01 | It is reported on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that Mu'adh said:The Messenger of Allah sent me (as a governor of Yemen) and (at the time of departure) instructed me thus: You will soon find yourself in a community one among the people of the Book, so first call them to testify that there is no god but Allah, that I (Muhammad) am the messenger of Allah, and if they accept this, then tell them Allah has enjoined upon them five prayers during the day and the night and if they accept it, then tell them that Allah has made Zakat obligatory for them that it should be collected from the rich and distributed among the poor, and if they agree to it don't pick up (as a share of Zakat) the best of their wealths. Beware of the supplication of the oppressed for there is no barrier between him and Allah.
19.02 | The above hadith has been mentioned with a different chain with a slightly different wording at the beginning, then follows the same.
19.03 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent Mu'adh towards Yemen (as governor) he said to him:Verily you would reach a community of the people of the Book, the very first thing to which you should call them is the worship of Allah, may His Glory be Magnificent, and when they become fully aware of Allah, instruct them that He has enjoined five prayers on them during the day and the night, and when they begin observing it, then instruct them that verily Allah has made Zakat obligatory for them which would be collected from the wealthy amongst them and distributed to their needy ones, and when they submit to it, then collect it from them and avoid (the temptation) of selecting the best (items) of their riches.
20 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) breathed his last and Abu Bakr was appointed as his successor (Caliph), those amongst the Arabs who wanted to become apostates became apostates. 'Umar b. Khattab said to Abu Bakr:Why would you fight against the people, when the Messenger of Allah declared: I have been directed to fight against people so long as they do not say: There is no god but Allah, and he who professed it was granted full protection of his property and life on my behalf except for a right? His (other) affairs rest with Allah. Upon this Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I would definitely fight against him who severed prayer from Zakat, for it is the obligation upon the rich. By Allah, I would fight against them even to secure the cord (used for hobbling the feet of a camel) which they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (as zakat) but now they have withheld it. Umar b. Khattab remarked: By Allah, I found nothing but the fact that Allah had opened the heart of Abu Bakr for (perceiving the justification of) fighting (against those who refused to pay Zakat) and I fully recognized that the (stand of Abu Bakr) was right.
21.01 | It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah said:I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah, and he who professed it was guaranteed the protection of his property and life on my behalf except for the right affairs rest with Allah.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:My uncle, you just make a profession that there is no god but Allah, and I will bear testimony before Allah (of your being a believer), Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah b. Abi Umayya addressing him said: Abu Talib, would you abandon the religion of 'Abdul-Muttalib? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) constantly requested him (to accept his offer), and (on the other hand) was repeated the same statement (of Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah b. Abi Umayya) till Abu Talib gave his final decision and be stuck to the religion of 'Abdul-Muttalib and refused to profess that there is no god but Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: By Allah, I will persistently beg pardon for you till I am forbidden to do so (by God), It was then that Allah, the Magnificent and the Glorious, revealed this verse: " It is not meet for the Prophet and for those who believe that they should beg pardon for the polytheists, even though they were their kith and kin, after it had been made known to them that they were the denizens of Hell" (ix. 113) And it was said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): " Verily thou canst not guide to the right path whom thou lovest. And it is Allah Who guideth whom He will, and He knoweth best who are the guided" (xxviii, 56).

25.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah said to his uncle (at the time of his death):Make a profession of it that there is no god but Allah and I will bear testimony (of your being a Muslim) on the Day of judgment. He (Abu Talib) said: Were it not the fear of the Quraysh blaming me (and) saying that it was the fear of (approaching death) that induced me to do so, I would have certainly delighted your eyes.

He (the narrator) said: Upon this Umar said: Messenger of Allah, I wish that you should pool together what has been left out of the provisions with the people and then invoke (the blessings of) Allah upon it. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) did it accordingly. He (the narrator) said: The one who had wheat in his possession came there with wheat. He who had dates with him came there with dates. And Mujahid said: He who possessed stones of dates came there with stones. I (the narrator) said: What did they do with the date-stones. They said: They (the people) sucked them and then drank water over them. He (the narrator said): He (the Holy Prophet) invoked the blessings (of Allah) upon them (provisions). He (the narrator) said: (And there was such a miraculous increase in the stocks) that the people replenished their provisions fully. He (the narrator) said: At that time he (the Holy Prophet) said: I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah, and I am His messenger. The bondsman who would meet Allah without entertaining any doubt about these (two fundamentals) would enter heaven.
27.02 | It is narrated either on the authority of Abu Huraira or that of Abu Sa'id Khudri. The narrator A'mash has narrated this hadith with a little bit of doubt (about the name of the very first narrator who was in direct contact with the Holy Prophet. He was either Abu Huraira or Abu Sa'id Khudri. Both are equally reliable transmitters of the traditions). He (the narrator) said:During the time of Tabuk expedition, the (provisions) ran short and the men (of the army) suffered starvation; they said: Messenger of Allah, would you permit us to slay our camels? We would eat them and use their fat. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do as you please. He (the narrator) said: Then 'Umar came there and said: Messenger of Allah, if you do that (if you give your consent and the men begin to slay their camels), the riding animals would become short. But (I would suggest you to) summon them along with the provisions left with them Then invoke Allah's blessings on them (different items of the provisions) It is hoped Allah shall bless them. The Messenger of Allah replied in the affirmative. (the narrator) said: He called for a leather mat to be used as a table cloth and spread it out. Then he called people along with the remaining portions of their provisions. He (the narrator) said: Someone was coming with handful of mote, another was coming with a handful of dates, still another was coming with a portion of bread, till small quantities of these things were collected on the table cloth. He (the narrator said): Then the messenger of Allah invoked blessing (on them) and said: Fill your utensils with these provisions. He (the narrator) said: They filled their vessel to the brim with them, and no one amongst the army (which comprised of 30,000 persons) was left even with a single empty vessel. He (the narrator) aid: They ate to their fill, and there was still a surplus. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: I bear testimony that there is no god but Allah and I am the messenger of Allah. The man who meets his Lord without harboring any doubt about these two (truths) would never be kept away from Paradise.
28.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Ubadah b. Samit that the messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:He who said:" There is no god but Allah, He is One and there is no associate with Him, that Muhammad is his servant and His messenger, that Christ is servant and the son of His slave-girl and he (Christ) His word which He communicated to Mary and is His Spirit, that Paradise is a fact and Hell is a fact," Allah would make him (he who affirms these truths enter Paradise through any one of its eight doors which he would like.

29 | It is narrated on the authority of Sunabihi that he went to Ubada b. Samit when he was about to die. I burst into tears. Upon this he said to me:Allow me some time (so that I may talk with you). Why do you weep? By Allah, if I am asked to bear witness, I would certainly testify for you (that you are a believer). Should I be asked to intercede, I would certainly intercede for you, and if I have the power, I would certainly do good to you, and then observed: By Allah, never did I hear anything from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) which could have been a source of benefit to you and then not conveyed it to you except this single hadith. That I intend to narrate to you today, since I am going to breathe my last. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: He who testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, Allah would prohibit the fire of Hell for him.
30.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Mu'adh b. Jabal:I was riding behind the Prophet (ﷺ) and there was nothing between him and me but the rear part of the saddle, when he said: Mu'adh b.

Jabal: To which I replied: At your beck and call, and at your pleasure, Messenger of Allah! He then again moved along for a few minutes and said: Mu'adh b. Jabal: To which I replied. At your beck and call, and at your pleasure. Messenger of Allah He, (the Holy Prophet) said: Do you know what right has Allah upon His servants? I said: Allah and His Messenger know best.

He (the Holy Prophet) with Mu'adh behind him, moved along for a few minutes and said: Mu'adh b. Jabal: To which I replied: At your beck and call, and at your pleasure, Messenger of Allah! He (the Holy Prophet) said: Do you know what rights have servants upon Allah in case they do it (i. e. they worship Allah without associating anything with Him)? I (Mu'adh b. Jabal) replied: Allah and His Messenger know best. (Upon this) he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: That He would not torment them (with the fire of Hell).
30.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Mu'adh b. Jabal that he observed:I was riding behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on an ass known as 'Ufair. He (Mu'adh) observed: He (the Holy Prophet) said: Mu'adh, do you know what right has Allah over His bondsmen and what right have His bondsmen over Him? Mu'adh added: I replied: Allah and his Messenger know best. Upon this he (the Prophet remarked: The right of Allah over His bondsmen is that they should worship Allah and should not associate anything with Him, and the right of His bondsmen over Allah, Glorious and Sublime, is that He does not punish him who associates not anything with Him. He (Mu'adh) added: I said to the Messenger of Allah: Should I then give the tidings to the people? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Do not tell them this good news, for they would trust in it alone.
30.03 | It is narrated on the authority of Mu'adh b. Jabal that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Mu'adh, do you know the right of Allah over His bondsmen? He (Mu'adh) said: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Messenger of Allah) said: That Allah alone should be worshipped and nothing should be associated with Him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What right have they (bondsmen) upon Him in case they do it? He (Mu'adh) said: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That He would not punish them.
30.04 | It is narrated on the authority of Aswad b. Hilal that he heard Mu'adh say this:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called, me and I replied to him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Do you know the right of Allah upon the people? and then followed the hadith (mentioned above).
31 | It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira:We were sitting around the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him). Abu Bakr and Umar were also there among the audience. In the meanwhile the Messenger of Allah got up and left us, He delayed in coming back to us, which caused anxiety that he might be attacked by some enemy when we were not with him; so being alarmed we got up. I was the first to be alarmed. I, therefore, went out to look for the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) and came to a garden belonging to the Banu an-Najjar, a section of the Ansar went round it looking for a gate but failed to find one. Seeing a rabi' (i. e. streamlet) flowing into the garden from a well outside, drew myself together, like a fox, and slinked into (the place) where God's Messenger was. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is it Abu Huraira? I (Abu Huraira) replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What is the matter with you? replied: You were amongst us but got up and went away and delayed for a time, so fearing that you might be attacked by some enemy when we were not with you, we became alarmed. I was the first to be alarmed. So when I came to this garden, I drew myself together as a fox does, and these people are following me. He addressed me as Abu Huraira and gave me his sandals and said: Take away these sandals of mine, and when you meet anyone outside this garden who testifies that there is no god but Allah, being assured of it in his heart, gladden him by announcing that he shall go to Paradise. Now the first one I met was Umar. He asked: What are these sandals, Abu Huraira? I replied: These are the sandals of the Messenger of Allah with which he has sent me to gladden anyone I meet who testifies that there is no god but Allah, being assured of it in his heart, with the announcement that he would go to Paradise. Thereupon 'Umar struck me on the breast and I fell on my back. He then said: Go back, Abu Huraira, So I returned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and was about to break into tears. 'Umar followed me closely and there he was behind me. The Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be on him) said: What is the matter with you, Abu Huraira? I said: I happened to meet 'Umar and conveyed to him the message with which you sent me. He struck me on my breast which made me fall down upon my back and ordered me to go back. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What prompted you to do this, 'Umar? He said: Messenger of Allah, my mother and father be sacrificed to thee, did you send Abu Huraira with your sandals to gladden anyone he met and who testified that there is no god but Allah, and being assured of it in his heart, with the tidings that he would go to Paradise? He said: Yes. Umar said: Please do it not, for I am afraid that people will trust in it alone; let them go on doing (good) deeds. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Well, let them.
32 | It is reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Prophet of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) addressed Mu'adh b. Jabal as he was riding behind him to which he replied:At thy beck and call, and at thy pleasure, Messenger of Allah. He again called out: Mu'adh, to which he (again) replied: At thy beck and call, and at thy pleasure. He (the Holy Prophet) addressed him (again): Mu'adh, to which he replied: At thy beck and call, and at thy pleasure, Messenger of Allah. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) observed: If anyone testifies (sincerely from his heart) that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is His bondsman and His messenger, Allah immuned him from Hell. He (Mu'adh) said: Messenger of Allah, should I not then inform people of it, so that they may be of good cheer? He replied: Then they would trust in it alone. Mu'adh told about it at the time of his death, to avoid sinning.
33.01 | It is narrated on the authority of 'Itban b. Malik that he came to Medina and said:Something had gone wrong with my eyesight. I, therefore, sent (a message to the Holy Prophet): Verily it is my ardent desire that you should kindly grace my house with your presence and observe prayer there so, that I should make that corner a place of worship. He said: The Prophet (ﷺ) came there, and those amongst the Companions whom Allah willed also accompanied him. He entered (my place) and offered prayer at my residence and his Companions began to talk amongst themselves (and this conversation centered round hypocrites), and then the conspicuous one, Malik b. Dukhshum was made the target and they wished that he (the Holy Prophet) should curse him and he should die or he should meet some calamity. In the meanwhile the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) completed his prayer and said: Does Malik b. Dukhshum not testify the fact that there is no god but Allah and verily I am the messenger of Allah. They replied: He makes a profession of it (no doubt) but does not do it out of (sincere) heart. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He who testifies that there is no god but Allah and I am the messenger of Allah would not enter Hell or its (flames) would not consume him. Anas said: This hadith impressed me very much and I told my son to write it down.

37.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Qatada. We were sitting with 'Imran b. Husain in a company and Bushair ibn Ka'b was also amongst us. 'Imran narrated to us that on a certain occasion the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) said:Modesty is a virtue through and through, or said: Modesty is a goodness complete. Upon this Bushair ibn Ka'b said: Verily we find in certain books or books of (wisdom) that it is God-inspired peace of mind or sobriety for the sake of Allah and there is also a weakness in it. Imran was so much enraged that his eyes became red and he said: I am narrating to you the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and you are contradicting it. He (the narrator) said: Imran reported the hadith, He (the narrator) said: Bushair repeated, (the same thing). Imran was enraged.

43.01 | It is reported on the authority of Anas that the Prophet of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him ) said:There are three qualities for which anyone who is characterised by them will relish the sweetness of faith: he to whom Allah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; he who loves a man for Allah's sake alone; and he who has as great an abhorrence of returning to unbelief after Allah has rescued him from it as he has of being cast into Hell.
43.02 | It is reported on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:There are three qualities for which any one who is characterised by them will relish the savour of faith: that he loves man and he does not love him but for Allah's sake alone; he is to whom Allah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; he who prefers to be thrown into fire than to return to unbelief after Allah has rescued him out of it.

47.02 | It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) observed:He who believes in Allah and the Last Day does not harm is neighbour, and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day shows hospitality to his guest and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day speaks good or remains silent.

I heard the Messenger of Allah as saying: He who amongst you sees something abominable should modify it with the help of his hand; and if he has not strength enough to do it, then he should do it with his tongue, and if he has not strength enough to do it, (even) then he should (abhor it) from his heart, and that is the least of faith.

Then there came after them their successors who said whatever they did not practise, and practised whatever they were not commanded to do. He who strove against them with his hand was a believer: he who strove against them with his tongue was a believer, and he who strove against them with his heart was a believer and beyond that there is no faith even to the extent of a mustard seed. Abu Rafi' said: I narrated this hadith to 'Abdullah b. 'Umar; he contradicted me. There happened to come 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud who stayed at Qanat, and 'Abdullah b 'Umar wanted me to accompany him for visiting him (as 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud was ailing), so I went along with him and as we sat (before him) I asked Ibn Mas'ud about this hadith. He narrated it in the same way as I narrated it to Ibn 'Umar.
50.02 | The same hadith has been transmitted by another chain of narrators on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud who observed:Never was there one among the prophets who had had not disciples who followed his direction and followed his ways.

Amongst the Muslims too was a man looking forward to (an opportunity of) his (the polytheist's) unmindfulness. He (the narrator) said: We talked that he was Usama b, Zaid. When he raised his sword, he (the soldier of the polytheists) uttered:" There is no god but Allah," but he (Usama b. Zaid) killed him. When the messenger of the glad tidings came to the Apostle (ﷺ) he asked him (about the events of the battle) and he informed him about the man (Usama) and what he had done He (the Prophet of Allah) called for him and asked him why he had killed him. He (Usama) said: Messenger of Allah, he struck the Muslims and killed such and such of them. And he even named some of them. (He continued): I attacked him and when he saw the sword he said: There is no god but Allah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Did you kill him? He (Usama) replied in the affirmative. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: What would you do with:" There is no god but Allah," when he would come (before you) on the Day of Judgment? He (Usama) said: Messenger of Allah, beg pardon for me (from your Lord). He (the Holy Prophet) said: What would you do with:" There is no god but Allah" when he would come (before you) on the Day of Judgment? He (the Holy Prophet) added nothing to it but kept saying: What would you do with:" There is no god but Allah," when he would come (before you) on the Day of Judgment?

110.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Thabit b. al-Dahhak that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observes:None is obliged to give votive offering (of a thing) which is not in his possession and the cursing of a believer is tantamount to killing him, and he who killed himself with a thing in this world would be tormented with that (very thing) on the Day of Resurrection, and he who made a false claim to increase (his wealth), Allah would make no addition but that of paucity, and he who perjured would earn the wrath of God

He (the Holy Prophet) said about a man who claimed to be a Muslim that he was one of the denizens of the Fire (of Hell). When we were in the thick of the battle that man fought desperately and was wounded. It was said: Messenger of Allah, the person whom you at first called as the denizen of Fire fought desperately and died. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: He was doomed to the Fire (of Hell). Some men were on the verge of doubt (about his fate) when it was said that he was not dead but fatally wounded. When it was night he could not stand the (pain of his) wound and killed himself. The Apostle (ﷺ) was informed of that. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Allah is Great, I bear testimony to the fact that I am the servant of Allah and His messenger. He then commanded Bilal to announce to the people that none but a Muslim would enter Paradise. Verily Allah helps this faith even by a sinful person.
112 | It is reported on the authority of Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idi that there was an encounter between the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the polytheists, and they fought (against one another). At the conclusion of the battle the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bent his steps towards his army and they (the enemies) bent their steps towards their army. And there was a person (his name was Quzman and he was one of the hypocrites) among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who did not spare a detached (fighter of the enemy) but pursued and killed him with the sword. They (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said:None served us better today than this man Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: Verily he is one of the denizens of Fire. One of the people (Muslims) said: I will constantly shadow him. Then this man went out along with him. He halted whenever he halted, and ran along with him whenever he ran. He (the narrator) said: The man was seriously injured. He (could not stand the pain) and hastened his own death. He placed the blade of the sword on the ground with the tip between his chest and then pressed himself against the sword and killed himself. Then the man (following him) went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: I bear testimony that verily thou art the Messenger of Allah, He (the Holy Prophet) said: What is the matter? He replied: The person about whom you just mentioned that he was one among the denizens of Fire and the people were surprised (at this) and I said to them that I would bring (the news about him) and consequently I went out in search of him till I (found him ) to be very seriously injured. He hastened his death. He placed the blade of the sword upon the ground and its tip between his chest and then pressed himself against that and killed himself. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: A person performs the deeds which to the people appear to be the deeds befitting the dweller of Paradise, but he is in fact one of the denizens of Hell. And verily a person does an act which in the eyes of public is one which is done by the denizens of Hell, but the person is one among the dwellers of Paradise.
113.01 | It is reported on the authority of Hasan:A person belonging to the people of the past suffered from a boil, when it pained him, he drew out an arrow from the quiver and pierced it.

114 | It is narrated on the authority of 'Umar b. Khattab that when it was the day of Khaibar a party of Companions of the Apostle (ﷺ) came there and said:So and so is a martyr, till they happened to pass by a man and said: So and so is a martyr. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: Nay, not so verily I have seen him in the Fire for the garment or cloak that he had stolen from the booty, Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Umar son of Khattab, go and announce to the people that none but the believers shall enter Paradise. He ('Umar b. Khattab) narrated: I went out and proclaimed: Verily none but the believers would enter Paradise.
115 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira:We went to Khaibar along with the Apostle (ﷺ) and Allah granted us victory. We plundered neither gold nor silver but laid our hands on goods, corn and clothes, and then bent our stops to a valley; along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) there was a slave who was presented to him by one Rifa'a b. Zaid of the family of Judham, a tribe of Dubayb. When we got down into the valley the slave of the Messenger of Allah stood up and began to unpack the saddle-bag and was suddenly struck by a (stray) arrow which proved fatal. We said: There is a greeting for him, Messenger of Allah, as he is a martyr. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: Nay, not so. By Him in Whose hand is the life of Muhammad, the small garment which he stole from the booty on the day of Khaibar but which did not (legitimately) fall to his lot is burning like the Fire (of Hell) on him. The people were greatly perturbed (on hearing this). A person came there with a lace or two laces and said: Messenger of Allah, I found (them) on the day of Khaibar. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: This is a lace of fire or two laces of fire.
116 | It is narrated on the authority of Jabir that Tufail son of Amr al-Dausi came to the Apostle (ﷺ) and said:Do you need strong, fortified protection? The tribe of Daus had a fort in the pre-Islamic days. The Apostle (ﷺ) declined this offer, since it (the privilege of protecting the Holy Prophet) had already been reserved for the Ansar. When the Apostle (ﷺ) migrated to Medina, Tufail son of Amr also migrated to that place, and there also migrated along with him a man of his tribe. But the climate of Medina did not suit him, and he fell sick. He felt very uneasy. So he took hold of an iron head of an arrow and cut his finger-joints. The blood streamed forth from his hands, till he died. Tufail son of Amr saw him in a dream. His state was good and he saw him with his hands wrapped. He (Tufail) said to him: What treatment did your Allah accord to you? He replied. Allah granted me pardon for my migration to the Apostle (ﷺ): He (Tufail) again said: What is this that I see you wrapping up your hands? He replied: I was told (by Allah): We would not set right anything of yours which you damaged yourself. Tufail narrated this (dream) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Upon this he prayed: O Allah I grant pardon even to his hands.
117 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Verily Allah would make a wind to blow from the side of the Yemen more delicate than silk and would spare none but cause him to die who, in the words of Abu 'Alqama, has faith equal to the weight of a grain; while Abdul-'Aziz said: having faith equal to the weight of a dust particle.
118 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:Be prompt in doing good deeds (before you are overtaken) by turbulence which would be like a part of the dark night.

119.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that when this verse:" O ye who believe I raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor shout loud unto him in discourse, as ye shout loud unto one another, lest your deeds should become null and void, while you perceive not" (xlix. 2-5), was revealed. Thabit b. Qais confined himself in his house and said: I am one of the denizens of Fire, and he deliberately avoided coming to the Apostle (ﷺ). The Apostle (ﷺ) asked Sa'd b, Mu'adh about him and said, Abu Amr, how is Thabit? Has he fallen sick? Sa'd said: He is my neighbour, but I do not know of his illness. Sa'd came to him (Thabit), and conveyed to him the message of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Upon this Thabit said: This verse was revealed, and you are well aware of the fact that, amongst all of you, mine is the voice louder than that of the Messenger of Allah, and so I am one amongst the denizens of Fire, Sa'd Informed the Prophet about it. Upon this the Messenger of Allah observed: (Nay, not so) but he (Thabit) is one of the dwellers of Paradise.
119.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik by another chain of transmitters in which these words are found:Thabit b. Qais was the orator of the Ansar, when this verse was revealed: the rest of the hadith is the same with the exception that there is no mention of Sa'd b. Mu'adh in it.
119.03 | This hadith is also transmitted by Ahmad b. Sa'id, Habban, Sulaiman b. Mughira on the authority of Anas who said:When the verse was revealed:" Do not raise your voice louder than the voice of the Apostle," no mention was made of Sa'd b, Mu'adh in it.
119.04 | This hadith is narrated on the authority of Anas by another chain of transmitters in which there is no mention of Sa'd b. Mu'adh, but the following words are there:We observed a man, one of the dwellers of Paradise, walking about amongst us.
120.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas'ud that some people said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ):Messenger of Allah, would we be held responsible for our deeds committed in the state of ignorance (before embracing Islam)? Upon his he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He who amongst you performed good deeds in Islam, He would not be held responsible for them (misdeeds which he committed in ignorance) and he who committed evil (even after embracing Islam) would be held responsible or his misdeeds that he committed in the state of ignorance as well as in that of Islam.
120.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas'ud:We once said: Messenger of Allah, would we be held responsible for our deeds committed in the state of ignorance? He (the Holy Prophet) observed: He who did good deeds in Islam would not be held responsible for what he did in the state of ignorance, but he who committed evil (after having come within the fold of Islam) would be held responsible for his previous and later deeds.
120.03 | This hadith has been transmitted by Minjab b. al-Harith Tamimi with the same chain of transmitters.
121 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Shamasa Mahri that he said:We went to Amr b. al-As and he was about to die. He wept for a long time and turned his face towards the wall. His son said: Did the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him not give you tidings of this? Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) not give you tidings of this? He (the narrator) said: He turned his face (towards the audience) and said: The best thing which we can count upon is the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Verily I have passed through three phases. (The first one) in which I found myself averse to none else more than I was averse to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and there was no other desire stronger in me than the one that I should overpower him and kill him. Had I died in this state, I would have been definitely one of the denizens of Fire. When Allah instilled the love of Islam in my heart, I came to the Apostle (ﷺ) and said: Stretch out your right hand so that may pledge my allegiance to you. He stretched out his right hand, I withdrew my hand, He (the Holy Prophet) said: What has happened to you, O 'Amr? replied: I intend to lay down some condition. He asked: What condition do you intend to put forward? I said: should be granted pardon. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Are you not aware of the fact that Islam wipes out all the previous (misdeeds)? Verily migration wipes out all the previous (misdeeds), and verily the pilgrimage wipes out all the (previous) misdeeds. And then no one as or dear to me than the Messenger of Allah and none was more sublime in my eyes than he, Never could I, pluck courage to catch a full glimpse of his face due to its splendour. So if I am asked to describe his features, I cannot do that for I have not eyed him fully. Had I died in this state had every reason to hope that I would have bee among the dwellers of Paradise. Then we were responsible for certain things (in the light of which) I am unable to know what is in store for me. When I die, let neither female mourner nor fire accompany me. When you bury me, fill my grave well with earth, then stand around it for the time within which a camel is slaughtered and its meat is distributed so that I may enjoy your intimacy and (in your company) ascertain what answer I can give to the messengers (angels) of Allah.
122 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that some persons amongst the polytheist had committed a large number of murders and had excessively indulged in fornication. Then they came to Muhammad (ﷺ) and said:Whatever you assert and whatever you call to is indeed good. But if you inform us that there is atonement of our past deeds (then we would embrace Islam). Then it was revealed: And those who call not unto another god along with Allah and slay not any soul which Allah has forbidden except in the cause of justice, nor commit fornication; and he who does this shall meet the requital of sin. Multiplied for him shall be the torment on the Day of Resurrection, and he shall therein abide disgraced, except him who repents a believes and does good deeds. Then these! for the Allah shall change their vices into virtues. Verily Allah is Ever Forgiving, Merciful (xxv. 68-70). Say thou: O my bondsmen woo have committed extravagance against themselves despair not of the Mercy of Allah I Verily Allah will forgive the sins altogether. He is indeed the Forgiving, the Merciful (xxxix. 53).
123.01 | Hakim b. Hizam reported to 'Urwa b. Zubair that he said to the Messenger of Allah:Do you think that there is any thing for me (of he reward with the Lord) for the deed of religious purification that I did in the state of ignorance? Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) said to him: You accepted Islam with all the previous virtues that you practised.
123.02 | Hakim b. Hizam reported to 'Urwa b. Zubair that he said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ):Messenger of Allah, do you think if there is any reward (of the Lord with me on the Day of Resurrection) for the deeds of religious purification that I performed in the state of ignorance, such as charity, freeing a slave, cementing of blood-relations? Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) said to him: You have accepted Islam with all the previous virtues that you had practised.
123.03 | It is narrate on the authority of Hakim b. Hizam:I said: Messenger of Allah, I did so some of the deeds in the state of ignorance. (One of the transmitters Hisham b. Urwa explained them as acts of piety. Upon this the Messenger, of Allah remarked: You have embraced Islam with all the previous acts of virtue. I said: By God, I would leave nothing undone in Islam the like of which I did in the state of ignorance.
123.04 | Hisham b. Urwa narrated it on the authority of his father:Hakim b. Hizam freed one hundred slave and donated one hundred camels (for the sake of Allah) during the state of ignorance. Then he freed one hundred slaves and donated one hundred camel (for the sake of Allah) after) he had embraced Islam. He subsequently came to the Apostle (ﷺ). The rest of the hadith is the same as narrated above.
124.01 | It is narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) that when this verse was revealed:" It is those who believe and confound not their belief with wrongdoing" (vi. 82), the Companions of the Messenger of Allah wore greatly perturbed. They said: Who amongst us (is so fortunate) that he does not wrong himself? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: It does not mean that which you presume It implies that which Luqman said to his son: O my son, do not associate anything with Allah, for indeed it is the gravest wrongdoing (xxxi. 13).
124.02 | This hadith is narrated by another chain of transmitters, (namely) lshaq b. Ibrahim. Ibn Idris says:My father transmitted it from Aban b. Taghlib who heard it from A'mash; then I heard it also from him (A'mash).
125 | It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that when it was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ):To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and whether you disclose that which is in your mind or conceal it, Allah will call you to account according to it. Then He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He Pleases; and Allah is over everything Potent" (ii. 284). the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt it hard and severe and they came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and sat down on their knees and said: Messenger of Allah, we were assigned some duties which were within our power to perform, such as prayer, fasting, struggling (in the cause of Allah), charity. Then this (the above-mentioned) verse was revealed unto you and it is beyond our power to live up to it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you intend to say what the people of two books (Jews and Christians) said before you:" We hear and disobey"? You should rather say:" We hear and we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! and unto Thee is the return." And they said:" We hear and we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, Our Lord! and unto Thee is the return." When the people recited it and it smoothly flowed on their tongues, then Allah revealed immediately afterwards:" The Apostle believes in that which is sent down unto him from his Lord, and so do the believers. Each one believes in Allah and His Angels and His Books and His Apostles, saying: We differentiate not between any of His Apostles and they say: We hearken and we obey: (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! and unto Thee is the return" (ii. 285). When they did that, Allah abrogated this (verse) and the Great, Majestic Allah revealed:" Allah burdens not a soul beyond its capacity. It gets every good that it earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. Our Lord, punish us not if we forget or make a mistake." (The Prophet said: ) Yes, our Lord! do not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us. (The Prophet said: ) Yes, our Lord, impose not on us (burdens) which we have not the strength to bear (The Prophet said: ) Yes, and pardon us and grant us protection! and have mercy on us. Thou art our Patron, so grant us victory over the disbelieving people" (ii. 286). He (the Lord) said: Yes.
126 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas:When this verse:" Whether you disclose that which is in your mind or conceal it, Allah will call you to account according to it" (ii 284), there entered in their minds something (of that fear) such as had never entered their hearts (before). The Apostle (ﷺ) observed: Say: We have heard and obeyed and submitted ourselves. He (the reporter) said: Allah instilled faith in their hearts and He revealed this verse:" Allah burdens not a soul beyond its capacity. It gets every good that it earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. Our Lord, call us not to account if we forget or make a mistake. He the (Lord) said: I indeed did it. Our Lord! do not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us. He (our Lord) said: I indeed did it. And pardon us, have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector" (ii. 286). He said: I indeed did it.
127.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:Verily Allah forgave my people the evil promptings which arise within their hearts as long as they did not speak about them or did not act upon them.
127.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:Verily the Great and Mighty Allah forgave my people the evil promptings arising in their minds, but they neither talked about them nor acted upon them.
127.03 | The same hadith has been narrated by Zuhair b. Harb, Waki, Ishaq b. Mansur, Husain b. 'Ali.
128.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:The Great and the Glorious Lord said (to angels): Whenever My bondsman intends to corn it an evil, do not record it against him, but if he actually commits it, then write it as one evil. And when he intends to do good but does not do it, then take it down is one act of goodness, but if he does it, then write down ten good deeds (in his record).
128.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:Allah, the Great and Glorious, said: Whenever my bondsman intends to do good, but does not do it, I write one good act for him, but if he puts it into practice I wrote from ten to seven hundred good deeds in favour of him. When he intends to commit an evil, but does not actually do it, do not record it. But if he does it, I write only one evil.
129 | Abu Huraira reported that Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said:When it occurs to my bondsman that he should do a good deed but he actually does not do it, record one good to him, but if he puts it into practice, I make an entry of ten good acts in his favour. When it occurs to him to do evil, but he does not commit it, I forgive that. But if he commits it, I record one evil against his name. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed. The angels said: That bondsman of Yours intends to commit evil. though His Lord is more Vigilant than he. Upon this He (the Lord) said: Watch him; if he commits (evil), write it against his name but if he refrains from doing it, write one good deed or him, for he desisted from doing it for My sake. The Messenger of Allah said: He who amongst you is good of faith, all his good acts are multiplied from ten to seven hundred times (and are recorded in his name) and all the evils that he commits are recorded as such (i, e. without increase) till he meets Allah.
130 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:He who intended to do good, but did not do it, one good was recorded for him, and he who intended to do good and also did it, ten to seven hundred good deeds were recorded for him. And he who intended evil, but did not commit it, no entry was made against his name, but if he committed that, it was recorded.
131.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) transmitted it from the Blessed and Great Lord:Verily Allah recorded the good and the evil and then made it clear that he who intended good but did not do it, Allah recorded one complete good in his favour, but if he intended it and also did it, the Glorious and Great Allah recorded ten to seven hundred virtues and even more to his credit. But it he intended evil, but did not commit it, Allah wrote down full one good in his favour. If he intended that and also committed it, Allah made an entry of one evil against him.

He (the narrator) said: There came Ash'ath b. Qais and said (to the people): What does Abu Abdur-Rahman (the Kunya of Abdullah b. Umar) narrate to you? They replied: So and so. Upon this he remarked: Abu Abdur-Rahman told the truth. This (command) has been revealed in my case. There was a piece of land in Yemen over which I and another person had a claim. I brought the dispute with him to the Messenger of Allah (to decide) He (the Holy Prophet) said: Can you produce an evidence (in your support)? I said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: (Then the decision would be made) on his oath. I said: He would readily take an oath. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: He who perjured for appropriating the wealth of a Muslim, whereas he is a liar, would meet Allah while He would be angry with him. This verse was then revealed:" Verily those who barter Allah's covenant and their oaths at a small price..." (iii 77).
138.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying:He who took an oath in order to entitle himself (to the possession) of a property, whereas he is a liar, would meet Allah in a state that He would be very much angry with him. Then the remaining part of the hadith was narrated as transmitted by A'mash but with the exception of these words: There was a dispute between me and another person in regard to a well. We referred this dispute to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Upon this he remarked: Either (you should produce) two witnesses (to support your contention) or his oath (would be accepted as valid).

This is my land and is in my possession: I cultivate it. There is no right for him in it. The Messenger of Allah said to the Hadramite: Have you any evidence (to support you)? He replied in the negative. He (the Messenger of Allah) said: Then your case is to be decided on his oath. He (the Hadramite) said: Messenger of Allah, he is a liar and cares not what he swears and has no regard for anything. Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) remarked: For you then there is no other help to it. He (the man from Kinda) set out to take an oath. When he turned his back the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed: If he took an oath on his property with a view to usurping it, he would certainly meet his Lord in a state that He would turn away from him.
139.02 | Wa'il reported it on the authority of his father Hujr:I was with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that two men came there disputing over a piece of land. One of them said: Messenger of Allah, this man appropriated my land without justification in the days of ignorance. The (claimant) was Imru'l-Qais b. 'Abis al-Kindi and his opponent was Rabi'a b. 'Iban He (the Holy Prophet) said (to the claimant): Have you evidence (to substantiate your claim)? He replied: I have no evidence. Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) remarked: Then his (that is of the defendant) is the oath. He (the claimant) said: In this case he (the defendant) would appropriate this (the property). He (the Holy Prophet) said: There is than no other way left for you but this. He (the narrator) said: When he (the defendant) stood up to take oath, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who appropriated the land wrongfully would meet Allah in a state that He would be angry with him. Ishaq in his narration mentions Rabi'a b. 'Aidan (instead of Rabi'a b. 'Ibdan).
140 | Abu Huraira reported:A person came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, what do you think if a man comes to me in order to appropriate my possession?

He (the inquirer) again said: What do you think if I am killed? He (the Holy Prophet) observed: You would be a martyr.

141.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Muhammad b. Hatim, Muhammad b. Bakr, Ahmad b. 'Uthman Naufali, Abu 'Asim, Ibn Juraij.
142.01 | Hasan reported:'Ubaidullah b. Ziyad paid a visit to Ma'qil b. Yasar Muzani in his illness of which he (later on) died. (At this juncture) Ma'qil said: I am going to narrate to you a hadith which I have heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and which I would not have transmitted if I knew that I would survive. Verily I have heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: There is none amongst the bondsmen who was entrusted with the affairs of his subjects and he died in such a state that he was dishonest in his dealings with those over whom he ruled that the Paradise is not forbidden for him.
142.02 | Hasan reported:Ubaidullah b. Ziyad went to see Ma'qil b. Yasir and he was ailing. He ('Ubaidullah) inquired (about his health) to which he (Ma'qil) replied: I am narrating to you a hadith which I avoided narrating to you (before). Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed: Allah does not entrust to his bondsman the responsibility of managing the affairs of his subjects and he dies as a dishonest (ruler) but Paradise is forbidden by Allah for such a (ruler). He (Ibn Ziyad) said: Why did you not narrate it to me before this day? He replied: I (in fact) did not narrate it to you as it was not (fit) for me to narrate that to you.
142.03 | Hasan reported:We were with Ma'qil b. Yasar inquiring about his health that Ubaidullah b. Ziyad came there. Ma'qil said to him: Verily I am going to narrate to you a hadith which I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then he narrated the hadith like those two (mentioned above).
142.04 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Malih that Ubaidullah b. Ziyad visited Ma'qil b. Yasar in his illness. Ma'qil said to him:I am narrating to you a hadith which I would have never narrated to you had I not been in death-bed. I heard Allah's apostle (ﷺ) say: A ruler who has been entrusted with the affairs of the Muslims but he makes no endeavors ( for the material and moral uplift) and does not sincerely mean (their welfare) would not enter Paradise along with them.
143.01 | Hudhaifa reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) narrated to us two ahadith. I have seen one (crystallized into reality), and I am waiting for the other. He told us: Trustworthiness descended in the innermost (root) of the hearts of people. Then the Qur'an was revealed and they learnt from the Qur'an and they learnt from the Sunnah. Then he (the Holy Prophet) told us about the removal of trustworthiness. He said: The man would have a wink of sleep and trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving the impression of a faint mark. He would again sleep and trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving an impression of a blister, as if you rolled down an ember on your foot and it was vesicled. He would see a swelling having nothing in it. He (the Holy Prophet) then took up a pebble and rolled it down over his foot and (said): The people would enter into transactions amongst one another and hardly a person would be left who would return (things) entrusted to him. (And there would be so much paucity of honest persons) till it would be said: There in such a such tribe is a trustworthy man. And they would also say about a person: How prudent he is, how broad-minded he is and how intelligent he is, whereas in his heart there would not be faith even to the weight of a mustard seed. I have passed through a time in which I did not care with whom amongst you I entered into a transaction, for if he were a Muslim his faith would compel him to discharge his obligations to me and it he were a Christian or a Jew, the ruler would compel him to discharge his obligations to me. But today I would not enter into a transaction with you except so and so.
143.02 | This hadith has been transmitted by another chain of transmitters:Ibn Numair, Waki', Ishaq b. Ibrahim, 'Isa b. Yunus on the authority of A'mash.
144.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Hudhaifa:We were sitting in the company of Umar and he said: Who amongst you has heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) talking about the turmoil? Some people said: It is we who heard it. Upon this be remarked: Perhaps by turmoil you presume the unrest of man in regard to his household or neighbour, they replied: Yes. He ('Umar) observed: Such (an unrest) would be done away with by prayer, fasting and charity. But who amongst you has heard from the Apostle (ﷺ) describing that turmoil which would come like the wave of the ocean. Hudhaifa said: The people hushed into silence, I replied: It is I. He ('Umar) said: Ye, well, your father was also very pious. Hudhaifa said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be, upon him ) observing: Temptations will be presented to men's hearts as reed mat is woven stick by stick and any heart which is impregnated by them will have a black mark put into it, but any heart which rejects them will have a white mark put in it. The result is that there will become two types of hearts: one white like a white stone which will not be harmed by any turmoil or temptation, so long as the heavens and the earth endure; and the other black and dust-coloured like a vessel which is upset, not recognizing what is good or rejecting what is abominable, but being impregnated with passion. Hudhaifa said: I narrated to him ('Umar): There is between you and that (turmoil) a closed door, but there is every likelihood of its being broken. 'Umar said: Would it be broken? You have, been rendered fatherless. Had it been opened, it would have been perhaps closed also. I said: No, it would be broken, and I narrated to him: Verily that door implies a person who would be killed or die. There is no mistake in this hadith. Abu Khalid narrated: I said to Sa'd, O Abu Malik, what do you mean by the term" Aswad Murbadda"? He replied: High degree of whiteness in blackness. I said: What is meant by" Alkoozu Mujakhiyyan"? He replied: A vessel turned upside down.
144.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Rib'i (b. Hirash). When Hudhaifa came from 'Umar he sat down to narrate to us and said:Verily yesterday when I was sitting with the Commander of the believers he asked his companions: When amongst you retains in his memory the utterance of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with regard to the turmoil? -and he cited the hadith like the hadith narrated on the authority of Abu Khalid, but he did not mention the exposition of his words (Murbaddan) and (Mujakhiyyan).
144.03 | It is transmitted by Rib'i b. Hirash. who narrated it on the authority of Hudhaifa that verily 'Umar said:Who would narrate to us or who amongst you would narrate to us (and Hudhaifa was one amongst them) what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said about the turmoil? Hudhaifa said: I will, and recited the hadith like that transmitted by Abu Malik on the authority of Rib'i and he observed in connection with this hadith that Hudhaifa remarked: I am narrating to you a hadith and it has no mistake, and said: That it is transmitted from he Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
145 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Islam initiated as something strange, and it would revert to its (old position) of being strange. so good tidings for the stranger.
146 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Umar ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:Verily Islam started as something strange and it would again revert (to its old position) of being strange just as it started, and it would recede between the two mosques just as the serpent crawls back into its hole.
147 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Verily the faith would recede to Medina just as the serpent crawls back into its hole.
148.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Anas that verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"The Hour (Resurrection) will not occur until 'Allah, Allah' is not said on earth."
148.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"The Hour (Resurrection) will not occur as long as anyone says: 'Allah, Allah.'"
149 | Hudhaifa reported:We were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he said. Count for me those who profess al-Islam. We said: Messenger of Allah, do you entertain any fear concerning us and we are (at this time) between six hundred and seven hundred (in strength). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: You don't perceive; you may be put to some trial, He (the narrator) said: We actually suffered trial so much so that some of our men were constrained to offer their prayers in concealment.
150.01 | Sa'd narrated it on the authority of his father (Abi Waqqas) that he observed:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) distributed shares (of booty among his Companions). I said: Messenger of Allah! Give it to so and so, for verily he is a believer. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: Or a Muslim. I (the narrator) repeated it (the word" believer" ) thrice and he (the Holy Prophet) turned his back upon me (and substituted the word)" Muslim," and then observed: I bestow it (this share) to a man out of apprehension lest Allah should throw him prostrate into the fire (of Hell) whereas in fact the other man is dearer to me than he.
150.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Sa'd that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bestowed upon a group of persons (things), and Sa'd was sitting amongst them. Sa'd said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ignored some of them. And he who was ignored seemed to be more deserving in my eyes (as compared with others). I (Sa'd) said: Messenger of Allah I why is it that you did not give to such and such (man)? Verily I see him a believer. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed: Or a Muslim? I kept quiet for some time but I was again impelled (to express) what I knew about him. I said: Messenger of Allah why is it that you did not give it to such and such? Verily, by Allah, see him a believer. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: (Nay, not a believer) but a Muslim. He (Sa'd) said: I again kept quite for some time but what I knew about him again impelled me (to express my opinion) and I said: Why is it that you did not give (the share) to so and so: By Allah, verily I see him a believer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked; (Nay, not so) but a Muslim. Verily (at times) I give (a share) to a certain man apprehending that he may not be thrown prostrate in the Fire, whereas the other man (who is not given) is dearer to me (as compared with him).
150.03 | Sa'd reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bestowed upon a group of persons (booty) and I was sitting with them. The remaining part of the hadith is the same as mentioned (above) with the additionI stood up and went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and whispered to him: Why did you omit such and such a man?
150.04 | The same hadith has been narrated on the authority of Muhammad b Sa'd and these words (are also there):The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave a stroke on my neck or between my two shoulders and said: Sa'd, do you fight with me simply because I gave (a share) to a man?
151.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:We have more claim to doubt than Ibrahim (ﷺ) when he said: My Lord! Show me how Thou wilt quicken the dead. He said: Believeth thou not? He said: Yes! But that my heart may rest at ease. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: May Lord take mercy on Lot, that he wanted a strong support, and had I stayed (in the prison) as long as Yusuf stayed, I would have responded to him who invited me.
151.02 | 'Abdullah b. Muhammad narrated the same hadith on the authority of Abu Huraira and in the transmission by Malik the words are that he (the Holy Prophet) recited the verse:" but that my heart may rest at ease" and completed it. This hadith has also been narrated by Abd b. Humaid Ya'qub, i. e. son of Ibrahim b. Sa'd, Abu Uwais, Zuhri, like the one narrated by Malik with the same chain of transmission and said: He recited this verse till he completed it.
152 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:There has never been a Prophet amongst the prophets who was not bestowed with a sign amongst the signs which were bestowed (on the earlier prophets). Human beings believed in it and verily I have been conferred upon revelation (the Holy Qur'an) which Allah revealed to me. I hope that I will have the greatest following on the Day of Resurrection.
153 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:By Him in Whose hand is the life of Muhammad, he who amongst the community of Jews or Christians hears about me, but does not affirm his belief in that with which I have been sent and dies in this state (of disbelief), he shall be but one of the denizens of Hell-Fire.
154.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Sha'bi that one among the citizens of Khurasan asked him:0 Abu! some of the people amongst us who belong to Khurasan say that a person who freed his bondswoman and then married her is like one who rode over a sacrificial animal. Sha'bi said: Abu Burda b. Abi Musa narrated it to me on the authority of his father that verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There are three (classes of persons) who would be given a double reward. One who is amongst the People of the Book and believed in his apostle and (lived) to see the time of Apostle Muhammad (ﷺ) and affirmed his faith in him and followed him and attested his truth, for him is the double reward; and the slave of the master who discharges all those obligations that he owes to Allah and discharges his duties that he owes to his master, for him there is a double reward. And a man who had a bondswoman and fed her and fed her well, then taught her good manners, and did that well and later on granted her freedom and married her, for him is the double reward. Then Sha'bi said: Accept this hadith without (giving) anything. Formerly a man was (obliged) to travel to Medina even for a smaller hadith than this. This hadith has been narrated by another chain of transmitters like Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, 'Abda b. Sulaiman Ibn Abi 'Umar Sufyan, 'Ubaidullah b. Mu'adh, Shu'ba; all of them heard it from Salih b. Salih.
155.01 | Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:By Him in Whose hand is my life, the son of Mary (ﷺ) will soon descend among you as a just judge. He will break crosses, kill swine and abolish Jizya and the wealth will pour forth to such an extent that no one will accept it.
155.02 | The same hadith is transmitted from Zuhri with the same chain of transmission. But in the tradition narrated by Ibn 'Uyaina the words are:" impartial leader and just judge" and in the tradition narrated by Yunus: the" judge judging with justice" and" impartial leader" are not mentioned. And in the hadith narrated by Salih like the one transmitted by Laith the words are:" impartial judge". And in the hadith transmitted by Ziyad the words are:" Till one sajda is better than the worldand what it contains. Then Abu Huraira used to say," recite" if you like: Not one of the People of the Book will fail to believe in him before his death.
155.03 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger or Allah (ﷺ) observed:I swear by Allah that the son of Mary will certainly descend as a just judge and he would definitely break the cross, and kill swine and abolish Jizya and would leave the young she-camel and no one would endeavour to (collect Zakat on it). Spite, mutual hatred and jealousy against one another will certainly disappear and when he summons people to accept wealth, not even one would do so.
155.04 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:What will be your state when the son of Mary descends amongst you and there will be an Imam amongst you?
155.05 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:What would you do when the son of Mary would descend and lead you?
155.06 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:What would you do when the son of Mary would descend amongst you and would lead you as one amongst you? Ibn Abi Dhi'b on the authority of Abu Huraira narrated: Your leader amongst you. Ibn Abi Dhi'b said: Do you know what the words:" He would lead as one amongst you" mean? I said: Explain these to me. He said: He would lead you according to the Book of your: Lord (hallowed be He and most exalted) and the Sunnah of your Apostle (ﷺ).
156 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: A section of my people will not cease fighting for the Truth and will prevail till the Day of Resurrection. He said: Jesus son of Mary would then descend and their (Muslims') commander would invite him to come and lead them in prayer, but he would say: No, some amongst you are commanders over some (amongst you). This is the honour from Allah for this Ummah.
157.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:The (Last) Hour shall not came till the sun rises from the place of its setting And on the day when it rises from the place of its setting even if all the people together affirmed their faith, it would not be of any avail to one who did not believe previously and derived no good out of his belief.
157.02 | This hadith has been narrated by another chain of transmitters, Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, Ibn Numair, Abu Kuraib, Ibn Fudail. This hadith has also been narrated through several other chains on the authority of Abu Huraira.
158 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:When three things appear faith will not benefit one who has not previously believed or has derived no good from his faith: the rising of the sun in its place of setting, the Dajjal, and the beast of the earth.
159.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one day said:Do you know where the sun goes? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place and then glides till it reaches its place of rest under the Throne and falls prostrate and remains in that state until it is asked: Rise up and return to the place whence you came, and it returns and emerges out from it rising place and the it glides (in such a normal way) that the people do not discern anything ( unusual in it) till it reaches its resting place under the Throne. Then it would be said to it: Rise up and emerge out from the place of your setting, and it will rise from the place of its setting. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said. Do you know when it would happen? It would happen at the time when faith will not benefit one who has not previously believed or has derived no good from the faith.
159.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one day said:Do you know where the sun goes? The remaining part of the hadith is the same.
159.03 | Abu Dharr reported:I entered the mosque and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting there. When the sun disappeared (from the sight) he said: O Abu Dharr! Do you know where it goes? He (the narrator) said: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) said. Verily it goes and begs permission, for prostration (to Allah) and the permission is granted to it. Once it would be said: Return to the place whence you came, and then it would rise from its setting place. Then he, after the recitation of 'Abdullah recited it: And that is its appointed term.
159.04 | Abu Dharr reported:I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) the (implication of the) words of Allah, the Exalted: The sun glides to its appointed resting place. He replied: Its appointed resting place is under the Throne.
160.01 | A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), reported:The first (form) with which was started the revelation to the Messenger of Allah was the true vision in sleep. And he did not see any vision but it came like the bright gleam of dawn. Thenceforth solitude became dear to him and he used to seclude himself in the cave of Hira', where he would engage in tahannuth (and that is a worship for a number of nights) before returning to his family and getting provisions again for this purpose. He would then return to Khadija and take provisions for a like period, till Truth came upon him while he was in the cave of Hira'. There came to him the angel and said: Recite, to which he replied: I am not lettered. He took hold of me [the Apostle said] and pressed me, till I was hard pressed; thereafter he let me off and said: Recite. I said: I am not lettered. He then again took hold of me and pressed me for the second time till I was hard pressed and then let me off and said: Recite, to which I replied: I am not lettered. He took hold of me and pressed me for the third time, till I was hard pressed and then let me go and said: Recite in the name of your Lord Who created, created man from a clot of blood. Recite. And your most bountiful Lord is He Who taught the use of pen, taught man what he knew not (al-Qur'an, xcvi. 1-4). Then the Prophet returned therewith, his heart was trembling, and he went to Khadija and said: Wrap me up, wrap me up! So they wrapped him till the fear had left him. He then said to Khadija: O Khadija! what has happened to me? and he informed her of the happening, saying: I fear for myself. She replied: It can't be. Be happy. I swear by Allah that He shall never humiliate you. By Allah, you join ties of relationship, you speak the truth, you bear people's burden, you help the destitute, you entertain guests, and you help against the vicissitudes which affect people. Khadija then took him to Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad b. 'Abd al-'Uzza, and he was the son of Khadija's uncle, i. e., the brother of her father. And he was the man who had embraced Christianity in the Days of Ignorance (i. e. before Islam) and he used to write books in Arabic and, therefore, wrote Injil in Arabic as God willed that he should write. He was very old and had become blind Khadija said to him: O uncle! listen to the son of your brother. Waraqa b. Naufal said: O my nephew! what did you see? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), then, informed him what he had seen, and Waraqa said to him: It is namus that God sent down to Musa. Would that I were then (during your prophetic career) a young man. Would that I might be alive when your people would expel you! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Will they drive me out? Waraqa said: Yes. Never came a man with a like of what you have brought but met hostilities. If I see your day I shall help you wholeheartedly.
160.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha with another chain of narrators like one transmitted by Yunus, i. e. the first thing with which the revelation was initiated with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) except the words:By Allah, Allah would never humiliate you, and Khadija said: O son of my uncle! Listen to the son of your brother.
160.03 | This hadith has been reported from 'A'isha by another chain of transmitters and the words are:He (the Holy Prophet) came to Khadija an his heart was trembling. The rest of the hadith has been narrated like one transmitted by Yunus and Ma'mar, but the first part is not mentioned, i. e. the first thing with which was started the revelation to the Prophet was the true vision. And these words like those transmitted by Yunus are mentioned thus: By Allah, Allah would never humiliate you. And there is also a mention of the words of Khadija: O son of my uncle! Listen to the son of your brother.
161.01 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah al-Ansari who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) reportedThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told about the intermission of revelation and narrated While I was walking I heard a voice from the sky, and raising my head I saw the angel who had come to me in Hira', sitting on a Throne between heaven and earth I was terror-stricken on that account and came back (to my family) and said:Wrap me up, wrap me up! So they wrapped me up, and the Blessed and Most Exalted Allah sent down:" You who are shrouded, arise and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes cleanse, and defilement shun," and" defilement" means idols; and then the revelation was followed continuously.
161.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Jabir b. Abdullah that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) says:The wahi was intermitted for me for a small span of time and while I was walking, and then the hadith like the one narrated by Yunus was transmitted but with the exception of these words: I was terror-stricken till I fell on the ground. Abu Salama said: Defilement means idols. After this the revelation was speeded up and followed rapidly.
161.03 | This hadith, the like of one narrated by Yunus has also been transmitted by Ma'mar on the authority of al-Zuhri who narrated:Allah the Most Glorious and Exalted revealed this:" You who are shrouded, arise and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes cleanse and defilement shun," before making the prayer obligatory. I felt terror-stricken as narrated by Uqail.
161.04 | Yahya reported:I asked Abu Salama what was revealed first from the Qur'an. He said:" 0, the shrouded one." I said: Or" Recite." Jabir said: I am narrating to you what was narrated to us by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: I stayed in Hira' for one month and when my stay was completed, I come down and went into the heart of the valley. Somebody called me aloud. I looked in front of me, behind me, on the right of my side and on my left, but I did not see any body. I was again called and I looked about but saw nothing. I was called again and raised my head, and there on the Throne in the open atmosphere he, i. e. Gabriel (peace be upon him) was sitting. I began to tremble on account of fear. I came to Khadija and said: Wrap me up. They wrapped me up and threw water on me and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, sent down this: you who are shrouded! arise and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes cleanse."
161.05 | Yahya b Abi Kathir has reported this hadith with the same chain of transmitters and narrated:And there he was sitting on the Throne between the heaven and the earth.
162.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven. Gabriel then asked the (gate of heaven) to be opened and he was asked who he was. He replied: Gabriel. He was again asked: Who is with you? He (Gabriel) said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? Gabriel replied: He has indeed been sent for. And (the door of the heaven) was opened for us and lo! we saw Adam. He welcomed me and prayed for my good. Then we ascended to the second heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) (asked the door of heaven to be opened), and he was asked who he was. He answered: Gabriel; and was again asked: Who is with you? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The gate was opened. When I entered 'Isa b. Maryam and Yahya b. Zakariya (peace be upon both of them), cousins from the maternal side. welcomed me and prayed for my good Then I was taken to the third heaven and Gabriel asked for the opening (of the door). He was asked: Who are you? He replied: Gabriel. He was (again) asked: Who is with you? He replied Muhammad (ﷺ). It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and I saw Yusuf (peace of Allah be upon him) who had been given half of (world) beauty. He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then he ascended with us to the fourth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with you? He said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The (gate) was opened for us, and lo! Idris was there. He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being (About him) Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, has said:" We elevated him (Idris) to the exalted position" (Qur'an xix. 57). Then he ascended with us to the fifth heaven and Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and then I was with Harun (Aaron-peace of Allah be upon him). He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken to the sixth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the door to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I was with Musa (Moses peace be upon him) He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven. Gabriel asked the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He said: Gabriel It was said. Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad (may peace be upon him.) It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I found Ibrahim (Abraham peace be upon him) reclining against the Bait-ul-Ma'mur and there enter into it seventy thousand angels every day, never to visit (this place) again. Then I was taken to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha whose leaves were like elephant ears and its fruit like big earthenware vessels. And when it was covered by the Command of Allah, it underwent such a change that none amongst the creation has the power to praise its beauty. Then Allah revealed to me a revelation and He made obligatory for me fifty prayers every day and night. Then I went down to Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah? I said: Fifty prayers. He said: Return to thy Lord and beg for reduction (in the number of prayers), for your community shallnot be able to bear this burden. as I have put to test the children of Isra'il and tried them (and found them too weak to bear such a heavy burden). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I went back to my Lord and said: My Lord, make things lighter for my Ummah. (The Lord) reduced five prayers for me. I went down to Moses and said. (The Lord) reduced five (prayers) for me, He said: Verily thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden; return to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. I then kept going back and forth between my Lord Blessed and Exalted and Moses, till He said: There are five prayers every day and night. O Muhammad, each being credited as ten, so that makes fifty prayers. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him; and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do, it will not be recorded for him; and if he does it, only one evil deed will be recorded. I then came down and when I came to Moses and informed him, he said: Go back to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: I returned to my Lord until I felt ashamed before Him.
162.02 | It is narrated on the the outhority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:(the angels) came to me and took me to the Zamzam and my heart was opened and washed with the water of Zamzam and then I was left (at my place).
162.03 | Anas b. Malik reported that Gabriel came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while he was playing with his playmates. He took hold of him and lay him prostrate on the ground and tore open his breast and took out the heart from it and then extracted a blood-clot out of it and said:That was the part of Satan in thee. And then he washed it with the water of Zamzam in a golden basin and then it was joined together and restored to it place. The boys came running to his mother, i. e. his nurse, and said: Verily Muhammad has been murdered. They all rushed toward him (and found him all right) His color was changed, Anas said. I myself saw the marks of needle on his breast.
162 | Anas b. Malik, while recounting the Night journey of the Prophet (ﷺ), from the mosque of Ka'bah, reported:Three beings (angels) came to him in the mosque of the Ka'bah, while he was sleeping in the sacred mosque before it (the Command of Night Journey and Accension) was revealed to him. The rest of the hadith is narrated like that of Thabit. However, some portions have occurred before and some of them have occurred after; some have been added and some deleted.
163 | Anas b. Malik reported:Abu Dharr used to relate that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The roof of my house was cleft when I was in Mecca and Gabriel descended and opened my heart and then washed it with the water of Zamzam. He then brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith and after emptying it into my breast, he closed it up. Then taking me by he hand, he ascended with me to th heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven, Gabriel said to the guardian of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied. It is Gabriel. He again asked whe he there was someone with him. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes. Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. When he looked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept. He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: He is Adam (peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept. Then Gabriel ascended with me to the second heaven. He asked its guardian to open (its gate), and its guardian replied in the same way as the guardian of the lowest heaven had said. He (opened it). Anas b. Malik said: He (the Holy Prophet) mentioned that he found in the heavens Adam, Idris, Jesus, Moses and Abraham (may peace be on all of them), but he did not ascertain as to the nature of their abodes except that he had found Adam in the lowest heaven and Abraham in the sixth heaven. When Gabriel and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed by Idris (peace be upon him) he said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother. He (the narrator) said: He then proceeded and said: Who is he? Gabriel replied: It is Idris. Then I passed by Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: Welcome tothe righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said to (Gabriel): Who is he? He replied: It is Moses. Then I passed by Jesus and he said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said (to Gabriel): Who is he? He replied: Jesus, son of Mary. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then I went to Ibrahim (peace be upon him). He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous son. I asked: Who is he? He (Gabriel) replied: It is Abraham. Ibn Shihab said: Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn 'Abbas and Abd Habba al-Ansari used to say that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Thereafter he ascended with me till I was taken to such a height where I heard the scraping of the pens. Ibn Hazm and Anas told that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah then made fifty prayers obligatory for my Ummah and I returned with that and passed by Moses. Moses, (peace be upon him) said: What has thy Lord enjoined on thy people? I said: Fifty prayers have been made obligatory on them. Moses (peace be upon him) said: Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah would not be able to bear this burden. Then I came back to my Lord and He remitted a portion out of thut. I then again went to Moses (peace be upon him) and informed him about it He said: Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden. I then went back to my Lord and He said: They are five and at the same time fifty, and what has been said will not be changed. I then returned to Moses and he said: Go back to thy Lord. whereupon I said: I feel ashamed of my Lord. Gabriel then travelled with me till we came to the farthest lote-tree Many a colour had covered it which I do not know. Then I was admitted to Paradise and saw in it domes of pearls, and its soil of musk.
164.01 | Anas b. Malik reported on the authority of Malik b. Sa sa', perhaps a person of his tribe, that the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) said:I was near the House (i. e. Ka'bah) in a state between sleep and wakefulness when I heard someone say: He is the third among the two persons. Then he came to me and took me with him. Then a golden basin containing the water of Zamzam was brought to me and my heart was opened up to such and such (part). Qatada said: I asked him who was with me (i e. the narrator) and what he meant by such and such (part). He replied: (It means that it was opened) up to the lower part of his abdomen (Then the hadith continues): My heart was extracted and it was washed with the water of Zamzam and then it was restored in its original position, after which it was filled with faith and wisdom. I was then brought a white beast which is called al-Buraq, bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule. Its stride was as long as the eye could reach. I was mounted on it, and then we went forth till we reached the lowest heaven. Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was again said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad (ﷺ). It was said: Has he been sent for? He (Gabriel) said: Yes. He (the Prophet) said: Then (the gate) was opened for us (and it was said): Welcome unto him! His is a blessed arrival. Then we came to Adam (peace be upon him). And he (the narrator) narrated the whole account of the hadith. (The Holy Prophet) observed that he met Jesus in the second heaven, Yahya (peace be on both of them) in the third heaven, Yusuf in the third, Idris in the fourth, Harun in the fifth (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them). Then we travelled on till we reached the sixth heaven and came to Moses (peace be upon him) and I greeted him and he said: Welcome unto righteous brother and righteous prophet. And when I passed (by him) he wept, and a voice was heard saying: What makes thee weep? He said: My Lord, he is a young man whom Thou hast sent after me (as a prophet) and his followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers. Then we travelled on till we reached the seventh heaven and I came to Ibrahim. He (the narrator) narrat- ed in this hadith that the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) told that he saw four rivers which flowed from (the root of the lote-tree of the farthest limits): two manifest rivers and two hidden rivers. I said: ' Gabriel! what are these rivers? He replied: The two hidden rivers are the rivers of Paradise, and as regards the two manifest ones, they are the Nile and the Euphrates. Then the Bait-ul-Ma'mur was raised up to me. I said: O Gabriel! what is this? He replied: It is the Bait-ul-Ma'mur. Seventy thousand angels enter into it daily and, after they come out, they never return again. Two vessels were then brought to me. The first one contained wine and the second one contained milk, and both of them were placed before me. I chose milk. It was said: You did right. Allah will guide rightly through you your Ummah on the natural course. Then fifty prayers daily were made obligatory for me. And then he narrated the rest of the hadith to the end.
164.02 | It is reported on the authority of Malik b. Sa'sa' that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) narrated the hadith (mentioned above) and added to it:I was brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith, and then the (part of the body) right from the upper end of the chest to the lower part of the abdomen was opened and it was washed with the water of Zamzam and then flled with wisdom and faith.
165.01 | Qatada reported that he heard Abu al-'Aliya saying that the cousin of your Prophet (ﷺ), i. e. Ibn Abbas, told him:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), while narrating his night journey observed: Musa (peace be upon him) was a man of high stature as if he was of the people of the Shanu'a (tribe), and Jesus was a well-built person having curly hair. He also mentioned Malik, the guardian of Hell, and Dajjal.
165.02 | Abu al-'Aliya reported:Ibn Abbas, the son of your Prophet's uncle, told us that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had observed: On the night of my night journey I passed by Moses b. 'Imran (peace be upon him), a man light brown in complexion, tall. well-built as if he was one of the men of the Shanu'a, and saw Jesus son of Mary as a medium-statured man with white and red complexion and crisp hair, and I was shown Malik the guardian of Fire, and Dajjal amongst the signs which were shown to me by Allah. He (the narrator) observed: Then do not doubt his (i. e. of the Holy Prophet) meeting with him (Moses). Qatada elucidated it thus: Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), met Moses (peace be upon him).
166.01 | Abu al-'Aliya narrated it on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed through the valley of Azraq, and he asked:Which valley is this? They said: This is the valley of Azraq, and he observed: (I perceive) as if I am seeing Moses (peace be upon him) coming down from the mountain track, and he is calling upon Allah loudly (saying: Here I am! at your service! ). Then he came to the mountain track of Harsha. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Which is this mountain track? They said: It is the mountain track of Harsha. He observed (I feel) as If I am seeing Yunus (Jonah-peace be upon him) son of Matta on a well- built red dromedary, with a cloak of wool around him and the rein of his dromedary is made of the fibres of date-palm, and he is calling upon Allah (saying: Here I am! at your service, my Lord! ). Ibn Hanbal said in the hadith narrated by him: Hushaim said that the meaning of khulba was fibre of date-palm.
166.02 | Abu al-'Aliya narrated it on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said:We travelled with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) between Mecca and Medina and we passed by a valley. He (the Holy Prophet) asked: Which valley is this? They said: This is the valley of Azraq Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: (I feel) as if I am seeing Moses (peace be upon him), and then he described something about his complexion and hair, which Diwud (the narrator) could not remember. He (Moses, as described by the Holy Prophet) was keeping his fingers in his ears and was responding loudly to Allah (saying: I am as Thy service, my Lord) while passing through that valley. We then travelled (further) till we came to the mountain trail. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Which mountain trail is this? They said: It is the Harsha or Lift. He (the Holy Prophet) said: (I perceive) as if I am seeing Yunus on a red camel, with a cloak of wool around him. The halter of his camel was that of the fibre of date-palm, and he was passing through the valley saying: I am at Thy service! my Lord.
166.03 | It is narrated on the authority of Mujahid that he said:We were with Ibn 'Abbas and (the people) talked about al-Dajjal. (One of them remarked. There is written between his eyes (the word) Kafir (infidel). The narrator said: Ibn 'Abbas remarked: I did not hear him (the Holy Prophet) say it, but he said: So far as Ibrahim is concerned. you may see your companion and so far as Moses is concerned, he is a well-built man with wheat complexion (riding) on a red camel with its halter made of the fibre of date-palm (and I perceive) as if I am seeing towards him as he is going down in the valley saying: I am at Thy service! my Lord.
167 | It is narrated on the authority of Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:There appeared before me the apostles, and Moses was among men as if he was one of the people of Shanu'a, and I saw Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him) and I saw nearest in resemblance with him was 'Urwa b. Mas'ud, and I saw Ibrahim (blessings of Allah be upon him) and I see your companions much in resemblance with him, i. e. his personality, and I saw Gabriel (peace be upon him) and I saw Dihya nearest in resemblance to him; but in the narration of Ibn Rumh it is Dihya b. Khalifa.
168 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:When I was taken for the night journey I met Moses peace be upon him). The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) gave his description thus: He was a man, I suppose-and he (the narrator) was somewhat doubtful (that the Prophet observed): (Moses) was a man erect in stature with straight hair on his head as it he was one of the men of the Shanu'a; and I met Jesus and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) described him as one having a medium stature and a red complexion as if he had (just) come out of the bath He observed: I saw Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and amongst his children I have the greatest resemblance with him. He said: There were brought to me two vessels. In one of them was milk and in the other one there was wine. And it was said to me: Select any one you like. So I selected the vessel containing milk and drank it. He (the angel) said: You have been guided on al-fitra or you have attained al-fitra. Had you selected wine, your Ummah would have been misled.
169.01 | It is narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:I found myself one night near the Ka'bah, and I saw a man with wheat complexion amongst the fair-complexioned men that you ever saw. He had a lock of hair the most beautiful of the locks that you ever saw. He had combed it. Water was trickling out of them. He was leaning on two men, or on the shoulders of two men, and he was circumscribing the Ka'bah. I asked, What is he? It was said: He is al-Masih son of Mary. Then I saw another person, stout and having too much curly hair, and blind in his right eye as if it was a full swollen grape. I asked Who is he? It was said: He is al-Masih al-Dajjal.
169.02 | It is narrated on the authority of 'Abdulldh b. Umar that one day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned in the presence of people about al-Masih al-Dajjal. He said:Verily Allah (hallowed be He and High) is not blind of one eye. Behold, but the Masih al-Dajjal is blind of right eye as if his eye is like a swollen grape, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I was shown in a dream in the night that near the Ka'bah there was a man fair-complexioned, fine amongst the white-complexioned men that you ever saw, his locks of hair were falling on his shoulders. He was a man whose hair were neither too curly nor too straight, and water trickled down from his head. He was placing his bands on the shoulders of two persons and amidst them was making a circuit around the Ka'bah. I said: Who is he? They replied: Al-Masih son of Mary. And I saw behind him a man with intensely curly hair, blind of right eye. Amongst the persons I have ever seen Ibn Qatan has the greatest resemblance with him. He was making a circuit around the Ka'bah by placing both his hands on the shoulders of two persons. I said: Who is he? They said; It is al-Masih al-Dajjal.
169.03 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:I saw near the Ka'bah a man of fair complexion with straight hair, placing his hands on two persons. Water was flowing from his head or it was trickling from his head. I asked: Who is he? They said: He is Jesus son of Mary or al-Masih son of Mary. The narrator) says: I do not remember which word it was. He (the Holy Prophet) said: And I saw behind him a man with red complexion and thick curly hair, blind in the right eye. I saw in him the greatest resemblance with Ibn Qitan I asked: Who is he? They replied: It is al-Masih al-Dajjal.
170 | It is narrated on the authority of Jabir b. 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:When the Quraish belied me, I was staying in Hatim and Allah lifted before me Bait-ul-Maqdis and I began to narrate to them (the Quraish of Mecca) its signs while I was in fact looking at it.
171 | 'Abdullah reported on the authority of his father 'Umar b. Khattab that he heard from the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) say:I was sleeping when I saw myself making circuit around the Ka'bah, and I saw there a man of fair complexion with straight hair between two men. Water was flowing from his head or water was falling from his head. I said: Who is he? They answered: He is the son of Mary. Then I moved forward and cast a glance and there was a bulky man of red complexion with thick locks of hair on his head, blind of one eye as it his eye was a swollen grape. I asked: Who is he? They said: He is Dajjal. He had close resemblance with Ibn Qatan amongst men.
172 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:I found myself in Hijr and the Quraish were asking me about my might journey. I was asked about things pertaining to Bait-ul-Maqdis which I could not preserve (in my mind). I was very much vexed, so vexed as I had never been before. Then Allah raised it (Bait-ul-Maqdis) before my eyes. I looked towards it, and I gave them the information about whatever they questioned me I also saw myself among the group of apostles. I saw Moses saying prayer and found him to be a well-built man as if he was a man of the tribe of Shanu'a. I saw Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him) offering prayer, of all of men he had the closest resemblance with 'Urwa b. Masu'd al-Thaqafi. I saw Ibrahim (peace be upon him) offering prayer; he had the closest resemblance with your companion (the Prophet himself) amongst people. When the time of prayer came I led them. When I completed the prayer, someone said: Here is Malik, the keeper of the Hell; pay him salutations. I turned to him, but he preceded me in salutation.
173 | It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah (b. Umar) that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was taken for the Night journey, he was taken to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha, which is situated on the sixth heaven, where terminates everything that ascends from the earth and is held there, and where terminates every- thing that descends from above it and is held there. (It is with reference to this that) Allah said:" When that which covers covered the lote-tree" (al-Qur'an, Iiii. 16). He (the narrator) said: (It was) gold moths. He (the narrator further) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was given three (things): he was given five prayers, be was given the concluding verses of Sura al-Baqara, and remission of serious Sins for those among his Ummah who associate not anything with Allah
174.01 | Al-Shaibini reported to us:I asked Zirr b. Hubaish about the words of Allah (the Mighty and Great):" So he was (at a distance) of two bows or nearer" (al-Qur'an, Iiii 8). He said: Ibn Mas'ud informed me that, verily, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw Gabriel and he had six hundred wings.
174.02 | Al-Shaibani narrated on the authority of Zirr who narrated it on this authority of Abdullah that the (words of Allah):" The heart belied not what he saw" (al Qur'an, Iiii. 11) imply that he saw Gabriel (peace be upon him) and he had six hundred wings.
174.03 | Zirr b. Hubaish narrated it on the authority of 'Abdullah (that the words of Allah):" Certainly he saw of the greatest signs of Allah" (al-Qur'an, liii. 18) imply that he saw Gabriel in his (original) form and he had six hundred wings.
175 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the (words of Allah):" And certainly he saw him in another descent" (al-Qur'an, Iiii. 13) imply that he saw Gabriel.
176.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he (the Holy Prophet) saw (Allah) with, his heart.
176.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the words:" The heart belied not what he saw" (al-Qur'an, Iiii. 11) and" Certainly he saw Him in another descent" (al-Qur'an, Iiii. 13) imply that he saw him twice with his heart.
176.03 | Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba narrated it on the same authorities.
177.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Masruq that he said:I was resting at (the house of) 'A'isha that she said: O Abu 'A'isha (kunya of Masruq), there are three things, and he who affirmed even one of them fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I asked that they were. She said: He who presumed that Muhammad (ﷺ) saw his Lord (with his ocular vision) fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I was reclining but then sat up and said: Mother of the Faithful, wait a bit and do not be in a haste. Has not Allah (Mighty and Majestic) said:" And truly he saw him on the clear horizon" (Al-Qur'an, Surat at-Takwir, 81:23) and" he saw Him in another descent" (Al-Qur'an, Surat Najm 53:13)? She said: I am the first of this Ummah who asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it, and he said: Verily he is Gabriel. I have never seen him in his original form in which he was created except on those two occasions (to which these verses refer); I saw him descending from the heaven and filling (the space) from the sky to the earth with the greatness of his bodily structure. She said: Have you not heard Allah saying: "Eyes comprehend Him not, but He comprehends (all) vision. and He is Subtle, and All-Aware" (Al-Qur'an, Surat al-An`am 6:103)? (She, i.e. 'A'isha, further said): Have you not heard that, verily, Allah says: "And it is not for any human being that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that He sends a messenger to reveal, by His permission, what He wills. Indeed, He is Most High and Wise." (Al-Qur'an, Surat ash-Shura, 42:51) She said: He who presumes that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) concealed anything from the Book of Allah fabricates the greatest lie against Allah. Allah says: "O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message. And Allah will protect you from the people. Indeed, Allah does not guide the disbelieving people." (Al-Qur'an, Surat al-Ma'idah, 5:67). She said: He who presumes that he would inform about what was going to happen tomorrow fabricates the greatest lie against Allah. And Allah says "Say, 'None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except Allah , and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected.'" (Al-Qur'an, Surat an-Naml, 27:65).
177.02 | Dawud reported on the same authorities the hadith as narrated above by Ibn 'Uliyya and added:She ('A'isha) said: If Muhammad were to conceal anything which was sent to him, he would have certainly concealed this verse:" And when thou saidst to him on whom Allah had conferred favour and thou too had conferred favour: Keep thy wife to thyself and fear Allah, and thou wast concealing in thy heart that which Allah was going to disclose, and thou wast fearing men while Allah has a better right that thou shouldst fear Him."
177.03 | Masruq reported:I asked 'A'isha if Muhammad (ﷺ) had seen his Lord. She replied: Hallowed be Allah, my hair stood on end when you said this, and he (Masruq) narrated the hadith as narrated above. The hadith reported by Diwud is more complete and longer.
177.04 | Masruq reported:I said to 'A'isha: What about the words of Allah:" Then he drew nigh and came down, so he was at a distance of two bows or closer still: so He revealed to His servant what He revealed" (al-Qur'an, liii. 8-10)? She said: It implies Gabriel. He used to come to him (the Holy Prophet) in the shape of men; but he came at this time in his true form and blocked up the horizon of the sky.
178.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr:I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Did you see thy Lord? He said: (He is) Light; how could I see Him?
178.02 | Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported:I said to Abu Dharr: Had I seen the Messenger of Allah, I would have asked him. He (Abu Dharr) said: What is that thing that you wanted to inquire of him? He said: I wanted to ask him whether he had seen his Lord. Abu Dharr said: I, in fact, inquired of him, and he replied: I saw Light.
179.01 | Abu Musa reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was standing amongst us and he told us five things. He said: Verily the Exalted and Mighty God does not sleep, and it does not befit Him to sleep. He lowers the scale and lifts it. The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the light. In the hadith narrated by Abu Bakr (instead of the word "light" ) it is fire. If he withdraws it (the veil), the splendour of His countenance would consume His creation so far as His sight reaches.
179.02 | A'mash has narrated this hadith on the same authority and said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was standing amongst us and he told us four things. He then narrated the hadith like the one reported by Abu Mua'wiya, but did not mention the words" His creation" and said: His veil is the light.
179.03 | Abu Musa reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was standing amongst us and (he said) four (things): Verily Allah does not sleep and it does not befit Him to sleep. He raises the scale and lowers it. The deeds of the day are presented to Him in the night and the deeds of the night in the day.
180 | 'Abdullah b. Qais transmitted on the authority of his father (Abu Musa Ash'ari) that the Apostle (ﷺ) said:There would be two gardens (in Paradise) the vessels and contents of which would be of silver, and two gardens whose vessels and contents would be of gold. The only thing intervening to hinder the people from looking at their Lord will be the mantle of Grandeur over His face in the Garden of Eden.
181.01 | Suhaib reported the Apostle (ﷺ) saying:When those deserving of Paradise would enter Paradise, the Blessed and the Exalted would ask: Do you wish Me to give you anything more? They would say: Hast Thou not brightened our faces? Hast Thou not made us enter Paradise and saved us from Fire? He (the narrator) said: He (God) would lift the veil, and of things given to them nothing would he dearer to them than the sight of their Lord, the Mighty and the Glorious.
181.02 | Hammad b. Salama narrated it on the same authority and added:He then recited the verse:" Those who do good will have the best reward and even more" (x. 26)
182.01 | Abu Haraira reported:The people said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Messenger of Allah, shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the moon on the night when it is full? They said: Messenger of Allah, no. He (the Messenger) further said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun, when there is no cloud over it? They said: Messenger of Allah. no. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Verily you would see Him like this (as you see the sun and the moon). God will gather people on the Day of Resurrection and say: Let every people follow what they worshipped. Those who worshipped the sun would follow the sun, and those who worshipped the moon would follow the moon, and those who worshipped the devils would follow the devils. This Ummah (of Islam) alone would be left behind and there would be hypocrites too amongst it. Allah would then come to them in a form other than His own Form, recognisable to them, and would say: I am your Lord. They would say: We take refuge with Allah from thee. We will stay here till our Lord comes to us. and when our Lord would come we would recognise Him. Subsequently Allah would come to them in His own Form, recognisable to them, and say: I am your Lord. They would say: Thou art our Lord. And they would follow Him, and a bridge would be set over the Hell; and I (the Holy Prophet) and my Ummah would be the first to pass over it; and none but the messengers would speak on that day, and the prayer of the messengers on that day would be: O Allah! grant safety, grant safety. In Hell, there would be long spits like the thorns of Sa'dan He (the Holy Prophet) said: Have you seen Sa'dan? They replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He said: Verily those (hooks) would be like the thorns of Sa'dan, but no one knows their size except Allah. These would seize people for their misdeeds. Some of them would escape for their (good) deeds, and some would be rewarded for their deeds till they get salvation. When Allah would finish judging His bondsmen and because of His mercy decide to take out of Hell such people as He pleases. He would command the angels to bring out those who had not associated anything with Allah; to whom Allah decided to show mercy. those who would say: There is no god but Allah. They (the angels) would recognise them in the Fire by the marks of prostration, for Hell-fire will devour everything (limb) of the sons of Adam except the marks of prostration. Allah has forbidden the fire to consume the marks of prostration. They will be taken out of the Fire having been burnt, and the water of life would be poured over them, and they will sprout as seed does In the silt carried by flood. Then Allah would finish judging amongst His bondsmen; but a man who will be the last to enter Paradise will remain facing Hell and will say: O my Lord I turn my face away from Hell, for its air has poisoned me ard its blaze has burnt me. He will then call to Allah as long as Allah would wish that he should call to Him. Then Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would say: If I did that, perhaps you would ask for more than that. He would say: I would not ask You more than this, and he would give his Lord covenants and agreements as Allah wished, and so He would turn his face away from the Fire When he turns towards the Paradise and sees it, he will remain silent as long as Allah wishes him to remain so. He will then say: O my Lord I bring me forward to the gate of the Paradise. Allah would say to him: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything besides what I had given you. Woe to thee! O son of Adam, how treacherous you are! He would say: O my Lord! and would continue calling to Allah till He would say to him: If I grant you that, perhaps you will ask for more. He will reply: No, by Thy greatness, and he will give His Lord promises and covenants as Allah had wished. He would then bring him to the gate of the Paradise, and when he would stand at the gate of the Paradise, it would lay open before him. and he would see the bounty and the joy that there is in it. He would remain quiet as long as Allah would desire him to remain silent. He would then say: O my Lord, admit me to Paradise. Allah. Blessed and Exalted, would say: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything more than what I had granted you? Woe to you! son of Adam, how treacherous you are! And he would say: O my Lord, I do not wish to be the most miserable of Thy creatures. He would continue calling upon Allah till Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would laugh. When Allah would laugh at him, He would say: Enter the Paradise. When he would enter, Allah would say: State your wish. He would express his wishes till Allah would remind him (the desire of) such and such (things). When his desires would be exhausted Allah would say: That is for thee and, besides it, the like of it also. 'Ata' b. Yazid said: Abu Sa'id al-Khudri was with Abu Huraira and be did not reject anything from the hadith narrated by him, but when Abu Huraira narrated:" Allah said to that man; ind its like along with it," Abu Sa'id said:" Ten like it along with it," O Abu Huraira. Abu Huraira said: I do not remember except the words:" That is for you and a similar one along with it." Abu Sa'id said: I bear witness to the fact that I remembered from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) his words:" That is for thee and ten like it." Abu Huraira said: That man was the last of those deserving of Paradise to enter Paradise.
182.02 | Abu Huraira reported:The people said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Messenger of Allah I shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? The rest of the hadith was narrated according to the narration of Ibrahim b. Sa'd.
182.03 | Hammam b. Munabbih said:This is what Abu Huraira transmitted to us from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he narrated many of them;- one of them was: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The lowest in rank among you in Paradise would be asked: Desire (whatever you like). And he would express his desire and again and again express a desire. tHe would be asked: Have you expressed your desire? He would say: Yes. Then He (Allah) would say: For thee is (granted) what thou desirest, and the like of it along with it.
183.01 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported:Some people during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Messenger of Allah! shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Yes, and added: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun at noon with no cloud over it, and do you feel trouble in seeing the moon (open) in the full moonlit night with no cloud over it? They said: No, Messenger of Allah! He (the Holy Prophet) said: You will not feel any trouble in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection any more than you do in seeing any one of them. When the Day of Resurrection comes a Mu'adhdhin (a proclaimer) would proclaim: Let every people follow what they used to worship. Then all who worshipped idols and stones besides Allah would fall into the Fire, till only the righteous and the vicious and some of the people of the Book who worshipped Allah are left. Then the Jews would be summoned, and it would be said to them: What did you worship? They will say: We worshipped 'Uzair, son of Allah. It would be said to them: You tell a lie; Allah had never had a spouse or a son. What do you want now? They would say: We feel thirsty, O our Lord! Quench our thirst. They would be directed (to a certain direction) and asked: Why don't you go there to drink water? Then they would be pushed towards the Fire (and they would find to their great dismay that) it was but a mirage (and the raging flames of fire) would be consuming one another, and they would fall into the Fire. Then the Christians would be summoned and it would be said to them: What did you worship? They would say: We worshipped Jesus, son of Allah. It would be said to them: You tell a lie; Allah did not take for Himself either a spouse or a son. Then it would be said to them: What do you want? They would say: Thirsty we are, O our Lord! Quench our thirst. They would be directed (to a certain direction) and asked: Why don't you go there to get water? But they would be pushed and gathered together towards the Hell, which was like a mirage to them, and the flames would consume one another. They would fall Into the Fire, till no one is left except he who worshipped Allah, be he pious or sinful. The Lord of the Universe, Glorified and Exalted, would come to them in a form recognisable to them and say; What are you looking for? Every people follow that which they worshipped. They would say: Our Lord, we kept ourselves separate from the people in the world, though we felt great need of them; we, however, did not associate ourselves with them. He would say: I am your Lord. They would say: We take refuge with Allah from thee and do not associate anything with Allah. They would repeat it twice or thrice, till some of them would be about to return. It would be said: Is there any sign between you and Him by which you will recognise Him? They would say: Yes. and the things would be laid bare. Those who used to prostrate themselves before God of their own accord would be permitted by God to prostrate themselves. But there would remain none who used to prostrate out of fear (of people) and ostentation but Allah would make his back as one piece, and whenever he would attempt to prostrate he would fall on his back. Then they would raise their heads and He would assume the Form in which they had seen Him the first time and would say: I am your Lord. They would say: Thou art our Lord. Then the bridge would be set up over the Hell and intercession would be allowed and they will say: O God, keep safe, keep safe. It was asked: Messenger of Allah, what is this bridge? He said: The void in which one Is likely to slip. There would be hooks, tongs, spits like the thorn that is found in Najd and is known as Sa'dan. The believers would then pass over within the twinkling of an eye, like lightning, like wind, like a bird, like the finest horses and camels. Some will escape and be safe, some will be lacerated and let go, and some will be pushed into the fire of Hell till the believers will find rescue from the Fire. By One in Whose hand is my life, there will be none among you more eager to claim a right than the believers on the Day of Resurrection for (saying their) brethren in the Fire who would say: O our Lord, they were fasting along with us, and praying and performing pilgrimage. It will be said to them: Take out those whom you recognise. Then their persons would be forbidden to the Fire; and they would take out a large number of people who had been overtaken by Fire up to the middle of the shank or up to the knees. They would then say: O our Lord I not one of those about whom Thou didst give us command remains in it. He will then say: Go back and bring out those in whose hearts you find good of the weight of a dinar Then they will take out a large number of people. Then they would say: O our Lord! we have not left anyone about whom You commanded us. He will then say: Go back and bring out those in whose hearts you find as much as half a dinar of good. Then they will take out a large number of people, and would say: O our Lord! not one of those about whom Thou commanded us we have left in it. Then He would say: Go back and in whose heart you find good to the weight of a particle bring him out. They would bring out a large number of people, and would then say: O our Lord, now we have not left anyone in it (Hell) having any good in him. Abu Sa'id Khudri said: If you don't testify me in this hadith, then recite if you like:" Surely Allah wrongs not the weight of an atom; and if it is a good deed. He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward" (al-Qur'an, iv. 40). Then Allah, Exalted and Great, would say: The angels have interceded, the apostles have interceded and the believers have interceded, and no one remains (to grant pardon) but the Most Merciful of the mercifuls. He will then take a handful from Fire and bring out from it people who never did any good and who had been turned into charcoal, and will cast them into a river called the river of life, on the outskirts of Paradise. They will come out as a seed comes cut from the silt carried by flood. You see it near the stone or near the tree. That which is exposed to the sun is yellowish or greenish and which is under the shade is white. They said: Messenger of Allah! it seems as if you had been tending a flock in the jungle. He (the Holy Prophet) said: They will come forth like pearls with seals on their necks. The inhabitants of Paradise would recognise them (and say): Those are who have been set free by the Compassionate One. Who has admitted them into Paradise without any (good) deed that they did or any good that they sent in advance Then He would say: Enter the Paradise; whatever you see in it is yours. They would say: O Lord, Thou hast bestowed upon us (favours) which Thou didst not bestow upon anyone else in the world. He would say: There is with Me (a favour) for you better than this. They would say: O our Lord! which thing is better than this? He would say: It is My pleasure. I will never be angry with you after this
183.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri:We said: Messenger of Allah, shall we see our Lord? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun on a cloudless day? We said: No. And the remaining part of the hadith has been narrated to the end like the hadith transmitted by Hafs b. Maisara with the addition of these words: Without the deed that they did or any good that they had sent before. It would be said to them: For you is whatever you see (in it) and with it the like of it. Abu Sa'id said: I have come to know that the bridge would be thinner even than the hair and sharper than the sword; and in the hadith narrated by Laith these words are not found: They would say, O our Lord! Thou hast bestowed upon us (favours) which thou didst not bestow on anyone else in the world.
183.03 | Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, Ja'far b. 'Aun, Hisham b. Sa'd, Zaid b. Aslam narrated the hadith as transmitted by Hafs b. Maisara, with certain additions and omissions.
184.01 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported:Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah will admit into Paradise those deserving of Paradise, and He will admit whom He wishes out of His Mercy, and admit those condemned to Hell into the Fire (of Hell). He would then say: See, he whom you find having as much faith in his heart as a grain of mustard, bring him out. They will then be brought out burned and turned to charcoal, and would be cast into the river of life, and they would sprout aj does a seed in the silt carried away by flood. Have you not seen that it comes out yellow (fresh) and intertwined?
184.02 | This hadith is transmitted by 'Amr b. Yahya with the same chain of transmitters who narrated:They would be cast into the river which is called (the river of) life, and (both the narrators) did not doubt the hadith. The text transmitted by Khalid is: just as seeds sprout beside the flood water; and in the hadith of Wuhaib it is: Just as the seed sprouts in the silt or deposit left by flood.
185.01 | It is reported by Abu Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:The (permanent) inhabitants of the Fire are those who are doomed to it, and verily they would neither die nor live in it (al-Qur'an, xx. 47; lxxxvii. 13). But the people whom the Fire would afflict (temporarily) on account of their sins, or so said (the narrator)" on account of their misdeeds," He would cause them to die till they would be turned into charcoal. Then they would be granted intercession and would be brought in groups and would be spread on the rivers of Paradise and then it would be said: O inhabitants of Paradise, pour water over them; then they would sprout forth like the sprouting of seed in the silt carried by flood. A man among the people said: (It appears) as if the Messenger of Allah lived in the steppe.
185.02 | Abu Nadra narrated it from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri who reported it from the Apostle (ﷺ) a similar (hadith) up to the words:" in the mud of the flood," and he did not mention (the words narrated) after it.
186.01 | Abdullah b. Mas'ud reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:I know the last of the inhabitants of Fire to be taken out therefrom, and the last of the inhabitants of Paradise to enter it. A man will come out of the Fire crawling. Then Allah, the Blessed and Exalted will say to him: Go and enter Paradise. So he would come to it and it would appear to him as if it were full. He would go back and say: O my Lord! I found it full. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, would say to him: Go and enter Paradise. He would come and perceive as if it were full. He would return and say: O my Lord! I found it full. Allah would say to him: Go and enter Paradise, for there is for you the like of the world and ten times like it, or for you is ten times the like of this world. He (the narrator) said. He (that man) would say: Art Thou making a fun of me? or Art Thou laughing at me. though Thou art the King? He (the narrator) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were visible. And it was said: That would be the lowest rank among the inhabitants of Paradise.
186.02 | It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas'ud that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him said:I recognise the last of the inhabitants of Fire to be taken out thereof. A man will come out of it crawling. It will be said to him: Go and enter Paradise. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He would go there to enter Paradise, but would find persons who have already occupied all its apartments. It would be said to him: Do you recall the time when you were in it (in the Hell)? He would say: Yes. It would be said to him: Express any desire. And he would express the desire. It would be said to him: For thee is that which thou desireth and ten times the world (worldly resources). He (the Holy Prophet) said: He would say: Art Thou making a fun of me, though Thou art the King? I saw the Messenger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were visible.
187 | Ibn Mas'ud reported:Verily the Messenger of Allah said: The last to enter Paradise would be a man who would walk once and stumble once and be burnt by the Fire once. Then when he gets beyond it, he will turn to it and say: Blessed is He Who has saved me from thee. Allah has given me something He has not given to any one of those in earlier or later times. Then a tree would be raised up for him and he will say: O my Lord I bring me near this tree so that I may take shelter in its shade and drink of its water. Allah, the Exalted and Great, would say: O son of Adam, if I grant you this, you will ask Me for something else. He would say: No. my Lord. And he would promise Him that he would not ask for anything else. His Lord would excuse him because He sees what he cannot help desiring; so He would bring him near it, and he would take shelter in its shade and drink of its water. Afterwards a tree more beautiful than the first would be raised up before him and he would say: O my Lord! bring me near this tree in order that I may drink of its water and take shelter in its shade and I shall not ask Thee for anything else. He (Allah) would say: O son of Adam, if I bring you near it you may ask me for something else. He would promise Him that he would not ask for anything else. His Lord will excuse him because He would see something he cannot help desiring. So He would bring him near it and he would enjoy its shade and drink its water. Then a tree would be raised up for him at the gate of the Paradise, more beautiful than the first two. He would say: O my Lord! bring me near this (tree) so that I may enjoy its shade and drink from its water. I shall not ask Thee for anything else. He (Allah) would say: O son of Adam! did you not promise Me that you would not ask Me anything else? He would say: Yes, my Lord, but I shall not ask Thee for anything else. His Lord would excuse him for He sees something the temptation of which he could not resist. He (Allah) would bring him near to it, and when He would bring him near it he would hear the voices of the inhabitants of the Paradise. He would say: O my Lord! admit me to it. He (Allah) would say: O son of Adam, what will bring an end to your requests to Me? Will it please you if I give you the whole world and a like one along with it? He will say: O my Lord! art Thou mocking at me, though Thou art the Lord of the worlds? Ibn Mas'ud laughed and asked (the hearers): Why don't you ask me what I am laughing at. They (then) said: Why do you laugh? He said: It is in this way that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) laughed. They (the companions of the Holy Prophet) asked: Why do you laugh. Messenger of Allah? He said: On account of the laugh of the Lord of the universe, when he ldesirer of Paradise) sai Thou mocking at me though Thou art the Lord of the worlds? He would say: I am not mocking at you, but I have power to do whatever I will.
188 | It is transmitted from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that, verily, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Amongst the inhabitants of Paradise the lowest in rank will be the person whose face Allah would turn away from the Fire towards the Paradise, and make a shady tree appear before him. He would say: O my Lord! direct my steps to this tree so that I (should enjoy) its shade; and the rest of the hadith is like that narrated by Ibn Mas'ud, but he did not mention:" He (Allah) would say: O son of Adam! what will bring an end to your making requests to Me" to the end of the tradition. In it, he added: Allah will remind him: Ask such and such, and when his expectations would be realised, Allah would say: That is for you, and ten times as much. He said that he would then enter his house and his two wives with large and dark eyes would enter after him. They will say: Praise be to Allah, Who has created you for us and us for you. He will say: No one has been given the like of what I have been given.
189.01 | The same hadith has been by AlMughirah bin Shu’bah attributing it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
189.02 | It is reported on the authority of al-Mughira b. Shu'ba that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Moses asked his Lord: Who amongst the inhabitants of Paradise is the lowest to rank? He (Allah) said: The person who would be admitted into Paradise last of all among those deserving of Paradise who are admitted to it. I would be said to him: Enter Paradise. He would say: O my Lord! how (should I enter) while the people have settled in their apartments and taken the shares (portions)? It would be said to him: Would you be pleased if there be for you like the kingdom of a king amongst the kings of the world? He would say: I am pleased my Lord. He (Allah) would say: For you is that, and like that, and like that, and like that, and that. He would say at the fifth (point): I am well pleased. My Lord. He (Allah) would say: It is for you and, ten times like it, and for you is what your self desires and your eye enjoys. He would say: I am well pleased, my Lord. He (Moses) said: (Which is) the highest of their (inhabitants of Paradise) ranks? He (Allah) said: They are those whom I choose. I establish their honour with My own hand and then set a seal over it (and they would be blessed with Bounties) which no eye has seen, no ear has heard and no human mind has perceived: and this is sub- stantiated by the Book of Allah, Exalted and Great:" So no soul knows what delight of the eye is hidden for them; a reward for what they did" (xxxii. 17).
189.03 | Sha'bi reported he had heard al-Mughira b. Shu'ba say on the pulpit that Moses (peace be upon him) had asked Allah, Exalted and Great, about the reward of the lowest of the inhabitants of Paradise, and the remaining part of hadith is the same (as narrated) above.
190.01 | Abu Dharr reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:I know the last of the inhabitants of Paradise to enter it and the last of the inhabitants of Hell to come out of it. He is a man who would be brought on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said: Present his minor sins to him, and withhold from him his serious sins. Then the minor sins would be placed before him, and it would be said: On such and such a day you did so and so and on such and such a day you did so and so. He would say: Yes. It will not be possible for him to deny, while he would be afraid lest serious sins should be presented before him. It would be said to him: In place of every evil deed you will have a good deed. He will say: My Lord! I have done things I do not see here. I indeed saw the Messenger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were exposed.
190.02 | This hadith is also narrated by another chain of narrators, i. e. Ibn Numair, Abu Mu'awiya, Waki', Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, Abu Kuraib, A'mash.
191.01 | It is reported on the authority of Abu Zubair that he heard from Jabir b 'Abdullah, who was asked about the arrival (of people on the Day of Resurrection). He said. We would come on the Day of Resurrection like this, like this, and see. carefully. that which concerns" elevated people". He (the narrator) said:Then the people would be summoned along with their idols whom they worshipped, one after another. Then our Lord would come to us and say: Whom are you waiting for? They would say: We are waiting for our Lord. He would say: I am your Lord. They would say: (We are not sure) till we gaze at Thee, and He would manifest Himself to them smilingly, and would go along with them and they would follow Him; and every person, whether a hypocrite or a believer, would be endowed with a light, and there would be spikes and hooks on the bridge of the Hell, which would catch hold of those whom Allah willed. Then the light of the hypocrites would be extinguished, and the believers would secure salvation. and the first group to achieve it would comprise seventy thousand men who would have the brightness of full moon on their faces, and they would not be called to account. Then the people immediately following them would have their faces as the brightest stars in the heaven. This is how (the groups would follow one after another). Then the stage of intercession would come, and they (who are permitted to intercede) would intercede, till he who had declared:" There is no god but Allah" and had in his heart virtue of the weight of a barley grain would come out of the Fire. They would be then brought in the courtyard of Paradise and the inhabitants of Paradise would begin to sprinkle water over them till they would sprout like the sprouting of a thing in flood water, and their burns would disappear. They would ask their Lord till they would be granted (the bounties) of the world and with it ten more besides it.
191.02 | Jabir reported that he had heard with his ears the Apostle (ﷺ) saying:Allah will bring out people from the Fire and admit them into Paradise.
191.03 | Hammad b. Zaid, reported:I said to 'Amr b. Dinar: Did you hear Jabir b. 'Abdullah narrating from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that Allah would bring out people from the Fire through intercession. He said: Yes.
191.04 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah repotted:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Verily people would be brought out from the Fire, and they would be burnt except the exterior (surfaces, fronts) of their faces; and they would enter Paradise.
191.05 | Yazid al-Faqir said:This view of the Khawarij (i.e. those who commit major sins and would be eternally doomed to Hell) had obsessed me, and we set out in a large group intending to perform the Hajj and then going to the people (for the propagation of the views of the Khawarij). He (the narrator) said: We happened to past by Medina and found there Jabir b. 'Abdullah sitting near a column narrating to the people (the ahadith of) the Prophet (ﷺ). When he mentioned the inhabitants of Hell, I said: O companion of the Messenger of Allah what is this that you narrate, whereas Allah says: "Verily whomsoever Thou shall commit to the Fire, Thou indeed humiliateth him" (al-Qur'an, iii. 192); and All those who endeavored to get out of that would be thrown back into it" (al-Qur'an, xxxi i. 20)? So what is it that you say? He said: Have you read the Qur'an? I said: Yes. He said: Have you heard about the (exalted) position of Muhammad (ﷺ), i.e. to which Allah would raise, him? I said: Yes. He said: Verily the position of Muhammad (ﷺ) is that of great glory and that is by which Allah would bring out whomsoever He would wish to bring out. He then described the Path (the Bridge) and the passing of the people over it, and said: I am afraid I may not have remembered (other things) but this much is still in my memory that people would come out of the Hell after having gone into it, and he said: They would come out of it as if they were the wood of the ebony tree. He (the narrator said: They would enter a river, one or the rivers of Paradise, and would bathe in it, and then come out as if they were (white like) paper. We then turned back and said: Woe be upon you! How can this old man tell a lie against the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? We turned back (from the views of the Khawarij), and by God every one of us abandoned this (band of Khawarij) except one man. A similar statement has been made by Abu Nu'aim.
192 | It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Four persons would be brought out from the Fire and would be presented to Allah. One of them would turn (towards the He) ) ) and say: O my Lord, when Thou hast brought me out from it, do not throw me back into it, and Allah would rescue him from it.
193.01 | Anas b Malik reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah would gather people on the Day of Resurrection and they would be concerned about it, and Ibn Ubaid said. They would get a Divine inspiration about it, and would say: If we could seek intercession with our Lord, we may be relieved from this predicament of ours. He (the Holy Prophet) said: They would come to Adam andsay, Thou art Adam, the father of mankind. Allah created thee with His own hand and breathed unto thee of His Spirit and commanded the angels and they prostrated before thee. So intercede for us with thy Lords, that He may relieve us from this position of ours. He would say: I am not in a position to do this, and would recall his error, and would fight shy of his Lord on account of that; go to Noah the first messenger (after me) sent by Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: So they would come to Noah (peace be upon him). He would say: I am not in a position to do that for you, and recall his fault which he had committed, and would fight shy of his Lord on account of that, (and would say): You better go to Ibrahim (peace be upon him) whom Allah took for a friend. They would come to Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and he would say: I am not in a position to do that for you, and would recall his fault that he had committed and would, therefore, fight shy of his Lord on that account (and would say): You better go to Moses (peace be upon him) with whom Allah conversed and con- ferred Torah upon him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: So they would come to Moses (peace be upon him) He would say: I am not in a position to do that for you, and would recall his fault that he had committed and would fight shy of his Lord on account of that (and would say): You better go to Jesus, the Spirit of Allah and His word He would say: I am not in a position to do that for you; you better go to Muhammad (ﷺ), a servant whose former and later sins have been forgiven. He (the narrator) said: The Messenger or Allah (ﷺ) observed: So they would come to me and I would ask the permission of my Lord and it would be granted to me, and when I would see Him, I would fall down in prostration, and He (Allah) would leave me thus as long as He would wish, and then it would be said: O Muhammad, raise your head, say and you would be heard; ask and it would be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted. Then I would raise my head and extrol my Lord with the praise which my Lord would teach me. I shall then inter- cede, but a limit would be set for me I would bring them out from the Fire and make them enter Paradise (according to the limit). I shall return then ard fall down in pros- tration and Allah would leave me (in that position) as long as He would wish to leave me it would be said: Rise, O Muhammad, say and you would be heard; ask and it would be conferred; intercede and intercession would be granted. I would raise my head and extrol my Lord with praise that He would teach me. I would theft intercede and a limit would be set for me. I would bring them out of the Fire (of Hell) and make them enter Paradise. He (the narrator) said: I do not remember whether he (the Holy Prophet) said at tLe third time or at the fourth time: O my Lord, none has been left in the Fire, but thise restrained by the Holy Qur'an, i e. those who were eternally doomed. Ibn Ubaid said in a narration: Qatada observed: whose everlasting stay was imperative".
193.02 | Anas reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The believers would gather on the Day of Resurrection, and they would be concerned about it, or would be made mindful of it (i. e. the trjuble for it), (and the remaining part of the hadith w, ) uld be narrated) like the one transmitted by Abu Uwana, and he said in the hadith: Then I would come for the fourth time, or I would return the fourth time, and would say: O my Lord, no one has been left but he whom the Holy Qur'an has restrained.
193.03 | Anas b. Malik reported:The Prophet of Allah (may peace be, upon him) said: Allah will gather the believers on the Day of Resurrection and they would be made mindful of it; and the rest (of the hadith) is like the one narrated above; and then he mentioned the fourth time: And I (the Holy Prophet) would say: O my Lord, no one is left in the Fire except he whom the Qur'an has restrained, i e. eternally doomed.
193.04 | Anas b. Malik reported:Verily the Apostle (ﷺ) said: He who professed: There is no god but Allah, would be brought out of the Fire even though he has in his heart virtue equal to the weight of a barley grain. Then he who professed: There is no god but Allah, would come out of the Fire, even though he has in his heart virtue equal to the weight of a wheat grain. He would then bring out from the Fire he who professed: There is no god but Allah, even though he has in his heart virtue equal to the weight of an atom. Ibn Minhal has made an addition (of these words) in his narration: Yazid said: I met Shu'ba and narrated to him this hadith. Shu'ba said: Qatada transmitted to us this hadith from Anas b. Malik who heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with this alteration that he substituted the word Zurra (grain) in place of Zarra (atom). Yazid said: Abu Bistam has made a change in it.
193.05 | Ma'bad b. Hilal al 'Anazi reported:We went to Anas b. Malik through Thabit and reached there (his house) while he was offering the forenoon prayer. Thabit sought permission for us and we entered, and he seated Thabit with him on his bedstead. He (Thabit) said to him (Anas b. Malik): O Abu Hamza (kunya of Anas b. Malik), your brothers from among the inhabitants of Basra ask you to narrate to them the hadith of intercession. He said: Muhammad (ﷺ) narrated to us: When it would be the Day of Resurrection, some of the people would rush to one another in bewilderment. They would come to Adam and say: Intercede (with your Lord) for your progeny. He would say: I am not fit to do this, but go to Ibrahim (peace be upon him) for he is the Friend of Allah. They would come to Ibrahim, but he would say: I am not fit to do this, but go to Moses, for he is Allah's Interlocutor. They would come to Moses, but he would say: I am not fit to do this, but you should go to Jesus, for he is the Spirit of Allah and His word. They would come to Jesus, and he would say, I am not fit to do this; you better go to Muhammad (ﷺ). They would come to me, and I would say: I am in a position to do that, I would go and ask the permission of my Lord and it would be granted to me. I would then stand before Him and would extol Him with praises which I am not able to do now, but with which Allah would inspire me, then I would fall in prostration and it would be said to me: O Muhammad, raise thy head, and say and it would be listened to; ask and it would be granted, intercede and it would be accepted. I shall say: My Lord, my people, my people It would be said: Go, and bring forth from it (Hell) him who has in his heart faith equal to the weight of a wheat grain or a barley seed. I would go and do that; then I would return to my Lord and extol Him with those praises (taught to me by Allah), then I would fall in prostration. It would be said to me: O Muhammad, raise your head, and say and it would be heard; ask and it would be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted. So I would say: My people. my people. It would be said to me: Go and take out from it (Hell) him who has in his heart faith equal to the weight of a mustard seed. I would go and do that. I would again return to my Lord and extol Him with those praises. I would then fall in prostration. It would be said to me: O Muhammad, raise your head: say, and you would be listened to; ask and it would be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted. I would say: My Lord, my people, my people. It would be said to me: Go, and bring out of the Fire him who has in his heart as much faith as the smallest, smallest, smallest grain of mustard seed. I would go and do that. This is the hadith which Anas narrated to us. We went out of his (house) and when we reached the upper part of Jabban (graveyard) we said: Would that we meet Hasan and salute him and he was hiding in the house of Abu Khalifa. He (Ma'bad b. Hilal, the narrator) said: We went to him and greeted him and we said: O Abu Sa'id, we come from your brother Abu Hamza (kunya of Anas), and we have never heard a hadith like this relating to intercession, which he has narrated to us. He said: Narrate it, we narrated the hadith. He said: Narrate it (still further). We said: He did not (narrate it) before us more than this. He said: He (Anas) had narrated it to us twenty years back, when he was strong and healthy. He has in fact missed something. I cannot make out whether the old man has forgotten or he has (intentionally) avoided to narrate it to you lest you should rely (absolutely) upon it (and abandon doing good deeds). We said to him: Relate that to us, and he laughed and said: There is haste in the nature of man. I did not make mention of it to you but for the fact that I wanted to narrate that to you (and added that the Prophet said): I would then return to my Lord for the fourth time and extol Him with these praises. I would then fall in prostration. It would be said to me: O Muhammad, raise your head: say and it will be listened to; ask and it will be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted. I would say: O my Lord, permit me regarding him who professed: There is no god but Allah. He (the Lord) would say: That is not for thee or that is not what lies with thee, but by My Honour, Glory, Greatness and Might, I would certainly take him out who professed it: There is no god but Allah. He (the narrator, Ma'bad) said: I hear testimony to the fact that the hadith transmitted to us-by Hasan was heard by him from Anas b. Malik and I can see that he reported it twenty years back, when he was hale and hearty.
194.01 | Abu Huraira reported:Meat was one day brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and a foreleg was offered to him, a part which he liked. He sliced with his teeth a piece out of it and said: I shall be the leader of mankind on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know why? Allah would gather in one plain the earlier and the later (of the human race) on the Day of Resurrection. Then the voice of the proclaimer would be heard by all of them and the eyesight would penetrate through all of them and the sun would come near. People would then experience a degree of anguish, anxiety and agony which they shall not be able to bear and they shall not be able to stand. Some people would say to the others: Don you see in which trouble you are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken you? Why don't you find one who should intercede for you with your Lord? Some would say to the others: Go to Adam. And they would go to Adam and say: O Adam, thou art the father of mankind. Allah created thee by His own Hand and breathed in thee of His spirit and ordered the angels to prostrate before thee. Intercede for us with thy Lord Don't you see in what (trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? Adam would say: Verily, my Lord is angry, to an extent to which He had never been angry before nor would He be angry afterward. Verily, He forbade me (to go near) that tree and I disobeyed Him. I am concerned with my own self. Go to someone else; go to Noah. They would come to Noah and would say: O Noah, thou art the first of the Messengers (sent) on the earth (after Adam), and Allah named thee as a" Grateful Servant," intercede for us with thy Lord. Don't you see in what (trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? He would say: Verily, my Lord is angry today as He had never been angry before, and would never be angry afterwards. There had emanated a curse from me with which I cursed my people. I am concerned with only myself, I am concerned only with myself; you better go to Ibrahim (peace be upon him). They would go to Ibrahim and say: Thou art the apostle of Allah and His Friend amongst the inhabitants of the earth; intercede for us with thy Lord. Don't you see in which (trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? Ibrahim would say to them: Verily, my Lord is today angry as He had never been angry before and would never be angry afterwards. and (Ibrahim) would mention his lies (and then say): I am concerned only with myself, I am concerned only with myself. You better go to someone else: go to Moses. They would come to Moses (peace be upon him) and say: O Moses, thou art Allah's messenger, Allah blessed thee with His messengership and His conversation amongst people. Intercede for us with thy Lord. Don't you see in what (trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? Moses (peace be upon him) would say to them: Verily. my Lord is angry as He had never been angry before and would never be angry afterwards. I, in fact, killed a person whom I had not been ordered to kill. I am concerned with myself, I am concerned with myself. You better go to Jesus (peace be upon him). They would come to Jesus and would say: O Jesus, thou art the messenger of Allah and thou conversed with people in the cradle, (thou art) His Word which I-Ie sent down upon Mary. and (thou art) the Spirit from Him; so intercede for us with thy Lord. Don't you see (the trouble) in which we are? Don't you see (the misfortune) that has overtaken us? Jesus (peace be upon him) would say: Verily, my Lord is angry today as He had never been angry before or would ever be angry afterwards. He mentioned no sin of his. (He simply said: ) I am concerned with myself, I am concerned with myself; you go to someone else: better go to Muhammad (ﷺ). They would come to me and say: O Mahammad, thou art the messenger of Allah and the last of the apostles. Allah has pardoned thee all thy previous and later sins. Intercede for us with thy Lord; don't you see in which (trouble) we are? Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? I shall then set off and come below the Throne and fall down prostrate before my Lord; then Allah would reveal to me and inspire me with some of His Praises and Glorifications which He had not revealed to anyone before me. He would then say: Muhammad, raise thy head; ask and it would be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted I would then raise my head and say: O my Lord, my people, my people. It would be said: O Muhammad, bring in by the right gate of Paradise those of your people who would have no account to render. They would share with the people some other door besides this door. The Prophet then said: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, verify the distance between two door leaves of the Paradise is as great as between Mecca and Hajar, or as between Mecca and Busra.
194.02 | It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that there was placed before the Messenger of Allah a cup of soft bread, soup and meat. He took part of the foreleg which he liked most. He sliced (with his teeth) a slice (out of that) and said:I would be the leader of mankind on the Day of Resurrection. He then sliced (that meat) for the second time and said: I am the leader of mankind on the Day of Resurrection. When he saw that his companions did not ask him (about this assertion) he said: Why don't you say: How would that be? They said: How would be it, Messenger of Allah? He said: People would stand before the Lord of the worlds. And the rest of the hadith was narrated like the one transmitted by Abu Hayyan, on the authority of Abu Zur'a, and in the story of Ibrahim, this addition was made. He said and made mention of his words with regard to the star: This is my Lord. And his words with regard to their gods: But the big among them has done that. And his words: I am ailing. He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, the distance between two leaves of the door from their supporting frames is as the distance between Mecca and Hajar or Hajar and Mecca. I do not remember how he said it (whether Mecca and Hajar or Hajar and Mecca).
195 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira and Hudhaifa that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, would gather people. The believers would stand till the Paradise would be brought near them. They would come to Adam and say: O our father, open for us the Paradise. He would say: What turned ye out from the Paradise was the sin of your father Adam. I am not in a position to do that; better go to my son Ibrahim, the Friend of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He (Ibrahim) would say: I am not in a position to do that. Verily I had been the Friend (of Allah) from beyond, beyond; you better approach Moses (peace be upon him) with whom Allah conversed. They would come to Moses (peace be upon him), but he would say: I am not in a position to do that; you better go to Jesus, the Word of Allah and His Spirit. Jesus (peace be upon him) would say: I am not in a position to do that. So they would come to Muhammad (ﷺ). He would then be permitted (to open the door of Paradise). Trustworthiness and kinship would be despatched, and these would stand on the right and left of the Path and the first of you would pass with (the swiftness) of lightning. He (the narrator) said: I said, O thou who art far dearer to me than my father and my mother I which thing is like the passing of lightning? He said: Have you not seen lightning, how it passes and then comes back within the twinkling of an eye? Then (they would pass) like the passing of the wind, then like the passing of a bird, and the hastening of persons would be according to their deeds, and your Apostle would be standing on the Path saying: Save, O my Lord, save. (The people would go on passing) till the deeds of the servants would be failing in strength, till a man would come who would find it hard to go along (that Path) but crawlingly. He (the narrator) said: And on the sides of the Path hooks would be suspended ready to catch anyone whom these would be required (to catch). There would be those who would somehow or other succeed in trasversing that Path and some would be piled up in Hell. By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Huraira it would take one seventy years to fathom the depth of Hell.
196.01 | Anas b. Malik reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I would be the first among people to intercede in the Paradise and amongst the apostles I would have the largest following (on the Day of Resurrection).
196.02 | Anas b. Malik reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Amongst the apostles I would have the largest following on the Day of Resurrec tion, and I would be the first to knock at the door of Paradise.
196.03 | Anas b. Malik said:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said: I would be the first intercessor in the Paradise and no apostle amongst the apostles has been testified (by such a large number of people) as I have been testified. And verily there woald be an apostle among the apostles who would be testified to by only one man from his people.
197 | Anas b. Malik reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. and would seek its opening. and the keeper would say: Who art thou? I would say: Muhammad. He would then say: It is for thee that I have been ordered, and not to open it for anyone before thee.
198.01 | Abu Huraira reported:Verity the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is for every apostle a (special) prayer with which he would pray. I wish I could reserve, my prayer for intercession of my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection.
198.02 | Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is for every apostle a prayer, and I intend (if Allah so willed) that I would reserve my prayer for the intercession of my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection.
198.03 | 'Amr b. Abu Sufyan transmitted a hadith like this from Abu Huraira who narrated it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
198.04 | Amr b. Abu Sufyan reported:Abu Huraira said to Ka'b al-Ahbar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said: For every apostle there Is a (special) prayer by which he would pray (to his Lord). I, however, intend (if Allah so willed) that I would reserve my prayer for the intercession of my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection. Ka'b said to Abu Huraira: Did you hear this from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? Abu Huraira said: Yes.
199.01 | Abu Huraira said:The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is for every apostle a prayer which is granted, but every prophet showed haste in his prayer. I have, however, reserved my prayer for the intercession of my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection, and it would be granted, if Allah so willed, in case of everyone amongst my Ummah provided he dies without associating anything with Allah.
199.02 | Abu Huraira said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Every Messenger is endowed with a prayer which is granted and by which he would (pray to his Lord) and it would he granted for him. I have, however, reserved my prayer for the intercession of my Ummab on the Day of Resurrection.
199.03 | Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There was for every apostle a prayer with which he prayed for his Ummah and it was granted to him; but I wish, if Allah so wills, to defer my prayer for the intercession of my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection.
200.01 | Anas b. Malik reported:Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is for every apostle a prayer with which he prays (to Allah) for his Ummah. I have reserved my prayer for the intercession of my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection.
200.02 | This hadith is narrated with the same chain of narrators by Qatada.
200.03 | Mis'ar transmitted it with the same chain of narrators from Qatada except that in the hadith narrated by Waki' (the Prophet) said:" He was endowed," and in the hadith reported by Abu Usama (the words are):" It is reported from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)."
200.04 | Muhammad b. 'Abd al-A'la reported it to me:Mu'tamir narrated to us on the authority of his father who transmitted it liom Anas that verity the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, and then narrated the hadith like the one transmitted by Qatada on the authority of Anas.

He said: Then what did you do? I said: I practised charm. He said: What urged you to do this? I said: (I did this according to the implied suggestion) of the hadith which al-Shu'ba narrated. He said: What did al-Shu'ba narrate to you? I said: Buraida b. Husaib al-Aslami narrated to us. The charm is of no avail except in case of the (evil influence) of an eye or the sting of a scorpion. He said: He who acted according to what he had heard (from the Holy Prophet) acted rightly, but Ibn 'Abbas narrated to us from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that he said: There were brought before me the peoples and I saw an apostle and a small group (of his followers) along with him, another (apostle) and one or two persons (along with him) and (still another) apostle having no one with him.

It was again said to me: See the other side of the horizon, and there was (also) a very huge group. It was said to me: This is your Ummah, and amongst them there were seventy thousand persons who would be made to enter Paradise without rendering any account and without (suffering) any torment. He then stood up and went to his house. Then the people began to talk about the people who would be admitted to Paradise without rendering any account and without (suffering) any torment. Some of them said: They may be those who (have had the good fortune of living) in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and some of them said: They be those who were born in Islam and did not associate anything with Allah. Some people mentioned other things. Thereupon came forth the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) before them and he said: What was that which you were talking about? They informed him. He said: They are those persons who neither practise charm, nor ask others to practise it, nor do they take omens, and repose their trust in their Lord. Upon this 'Ukkasha b.

221.03 | Abdullah b Mas'ud reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us and then supported his back (by reclining) against a leather tent and said: Behold, no one but a believing person would enter Paradise.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: It is at this juncture that every child would become white-haired and every pregnant woman would abort and you would see people in a state of intoxication, and they would not be in fact intoxicated but grievous will be the torment of Allah. He (the narrator) said: This had a very depressing effect upon them (upon the companions of the Holy Prophet) and they said: Messenger of Allah, who amongst us would be (that unfortunate) person (who would be doomed to Hell)? He said: Good tidings for you, Yajuj Majuj would be those thousands (who would be the denizens of Hell) and a person (selected for Paradise) would be amongst you. He (the narrator) further reported that he (the Messenger of Allah) again said: By Him in Whose Hand is thy life, I hope that you would constitute one-fourth of the inhabitants of Paradise. We extolled Allah and we glorified (Him). He (the Holy Prophet) again said: BY Him in Whose Hand is my life, I wish you would constitute one-third of the inhabitants of Paradise. We extolled Allah and Glorified (Him). He (the Holy Prophet) again said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I hope that you would constitute half of the inhabitants of Paradise.

Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Yes (it does happen), otherwise how can (a child) resemble her? Man's discharge (i. e. sperm) is thick and white and the discharge of woman is thin and yellow; so the resemblance comes from the one whose genes prevail or dominate.
312 | Anas b. Malik reported:A woman asked the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) about a woman who sees in her dream what a man sees in his dream (sexual dream). He (the Holy Prophet) said: If she experiences what a man experiences, she should take a bath.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. 'A'isha said to her: May your hand be covered with dust and injured. She narrated: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Leave her alone.

I pushed him backwith a push that he was going to fall. Upon this he said: Why do you push me? I said: Why don't you say: O Messenger of Allah? The Jew said: We call him by the name by which he was named by his family. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: My name is Muhammad with which I was named by my family. The Jew said: I have come to ask you (something). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Should that thing be of any benefit to you, if I tell you that? He (the Jew) said: I will lend my ears to it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) drew a line with the help of the stick that he had with him and then said: Ask (whatever you like). Thereupon the Jew said: Where would the human beings be on the Daywhen the earth would change into another earth and the heavens too (would change into other heavens)? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They would be in darkness beside the Bridge. He (the Jew) again said: Who amongst people would be the first to cross (this bridge).? He said: They would be the poor amongst the refugees. The Jew said: What would constitute their breakfast when they would enter Paradise? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: A caul of the fish-liver. He (the Jew) said. What would be their food alter this? He (the Holy Prophet) said: A bullockwhich was fed in the different quarters of Paradise would be slaughtered for them. He (the Jew) said: What would be their drink? He (the Holy Prophet) said: They would be given drink from the fountain which is named" Salsabil". He (the Jew) said: I have come to ask you about a thing which no one amongst the people on the earth knows except an apostle or one or two men besides him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Would it benefit you if I tell you that? He (the Jew) said: I would lend ears to that. He then said: I have come to ask you about the child. He (the Holy Prophet) said: The reproductive substance of man is white and that of woman (i. e. ovum central portion) yellow, and when they have sexual intercourse and the male's substance (chromosomes and genes) prevails upon the female's substance (chromosomes and genes), it is the male child that is created by Allah's Decree, and when the substance of the female prevails upon the substance contributed by the male, a female child is formed by the Decree of Allah. The Jew said: What you have said is true; verily you are an Apostle. He then returned and went away. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He asked me about such and such things of which I have had no knowledge till Allah gave me that.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Praise be to Allah, purify yourself with it, and covered his face, Sufyan b. 'Uyaina gave a demonstration by covering his face (as the Prophet had done). 'A'isha reported: I dragged her to my side for I had understood what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) intended and, therefore, said: Apply this cotton with musk to the trace of blood. Ibn 'Umar in his hadith (has mentioned the words of 'A'isha thus): Apply it to the marks of blood.
332.02 | 'A'isha reported:A woman asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) how he should wash herself after the menstrual period. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take a cotton with musk and purity yourself, and the rest of the hadith was narrated like that of Sufyan.
332.03 | 'A'isha reported:Asma (daughter of Shakal) asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about washing after menstruation. He said: Everyone amongst you should use water (mixed with the leaves of) the lote-tree and cleanse herself well, and then pour water on her head and rub it vigorously till it reaches the roots of the hair. Then she should pour water on it. Afterwards she should take a piece of cotton smeared with musk and cleanse herself with it. Asma' said: How should she cleanse herself with the help of that? Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) observed: Praise be to Allah, she should cleanse herself. 'A'isha said in a subdued tone that she should apply it to the trace of blood. She (Asma) then further asked about bathing after sexual intercourse. He (the Holy Prophet) said: She should take water and cleanse herself well or complete the ablution and then (pour water) on her head and rub it till it reaches the roots of the hair (of her) head and then pour water on her. 'A'isha said: How good are the women of Ansar (helpers) that their shyness does not prevent them from learning religion.
332.04 | This hadith is narrated by 'Ubaidullah b. Mu'adh with the same chain of transmitters (but for the words) that he (the Holy Prophet) said:Cleanse yourself with it, and he covered (his face on account of shyness).
332.05 | 'A'isha reported:Asma' b. Shakal came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, how one amongst us should take a bath after the menstruation, and the rest of the hadith is the same and there is no mention of bathing because of sexual intercourse.
333.01 | 'A'isha reported:Fatimah b. Abu Hubaish came to the Apostle (ﷺ) and said: I am a woman whose blood keeps flowing (even after the menstruation period). I am never purified; should I, therefore, abandon prayer? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Not at all, for that is only a vein, and is not a menstruation, so when menstruation comes, abandon prayer, and when it ends wash the blood from yourself and then pray.
333.02 | The hadith narrated by Waki' and with its chain of narrators has been transmitted on the authority of Hisham b. 'Urwa, but in the hadith narrated by Qutaiba on the authority of Jarir, the words are:" There came Fatimah b. Abu Hubaish, b. 'Abd al-Muttalib b. Asad, and she was a woman amongst us," and in the hadith of Hammid b. Zaid there is an addition of these words:" We abandoned mentioning him."
334.01 | 'A'isha reported:Umm Habiba b. Jahsh thus asked for a verdict from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): I am a woman whose blood keeps flowing (after the menstrual period). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That is only a vein, so take a bath and offer prayer; and she took a bath at the time of every prayer. Laith b. Sa'd said: Ibn Shihab made no mention that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had ordered her to take a bath at the time of every prayer, but she did it of her own accord. And in the tradition transmitted by Ibn Rumh there is no mention of Umm Habiba (and there is mention of the daughter of Jahsh only.)
334.02 | 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) reported:Umm Habiba b. Jahsh who was the sister-in-law of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the wife of 'Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, remained mustahada for seven years, and she, therefore, asked for the verdict of Shari'ah from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is not menstruation, but (blood from) a vein: so bathe yourself and offer prayer. 'A'isha said: She took a bath in the wash-tub placed in the apartment of her sister Zainab b. Jahsh, till the redness of the blood came over the water. Ibn Shihab said: I narrated it to Abu Bakr b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. al-Harith b. Hisham about it who observed: May Allah have mercy on Hinda! would that she listened to this verdict. By Lord, she wept for not offering prayer.
334.03 | This hadith has been thus reported by another chain of transmitters:Umm Habiba b. Jahsh came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and she had been a mustahada for seven years, and the rest of the hadith was narrated like that of 'Amr b. al-Harith up to the words:" There came the redness of the blood over water." and nothing was narrated beyond it.
334.04 | The hadith has been narrated by 'A'isha through another chain of transmitters (in these words):I The daughter of jahsh had been mustabida for seven years," and the rest of the hadith is the same (as mentioned above).
334.05 | On the authority of 'A'isha:Umm Habiba asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the blood (which flows beyond the period of menstruation). 'A'isha said: I saw her wash-tub full of blood. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Remain away (from prayer) equal (to the length of time) that your menses prevented you. After this (after the period of usual courses) bathe yourself and offer prayer.
334.06 | 'A'isha, the wife of the Apostle (ﷺ), said:Umm Habiba b. Jahsh who was the spouse of Abd al- Rahman b. Auf made a complaint to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about blood (which flows beyond the menstrual period). He said to her: Remain away (from prayer) equal (to the length of time) that your menstruation holds you back. After this, bathe yourself. And she washed herself before every prayer.
335.01 | Mu'adha reported:A woman asked 'A'isha: Should one amongst us complete prayers abandoned during the period of menses? 'A'isha said: Are you a Haruriya? When any one of us during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in her menses (and abandoned prayer) she was not required to complete them.
335.02 | It is reported from Mu'adha that she asked 'A'isha:Should a menstruating woman complete the prayer (abandoned during the menstrual period)? 'A'isha said: Are you a Hurariya? The wives of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) have had their monthly courses, (but) did he order them to make compensation (for the abandoned prayers)? Muhammad b. Ja'far said: (Compensation) denotes their completion.
335.03 | Mu'adha said:I asked 'A'isha: What is the reason that a menstruating woman completes the fasts (that she abandons during her monthly course). but she does not complete the prayers? She (Hadrat 'A'isha) said: Are you a Haruriya? I said: I am not a Haruriya, but I simply want to inquire. She said: We passed through this (period of menstruation), and we were ordered to complete the fasts, but were not ordered to complete the prayers.

Moses (peace be upon him), however, took a bath alone (in privacy) ; and they said (tauntingly):By Allah, nothing prohibits Moses to take a bath along with us, but sacrotal hernia. He (Moses) once went for a bath and placed his clothes on a stone and the stone moved on with his clothes. Moses ran after it saying: 0 stone, my clothes,0 stone, my clothes, and Banu Isra'il had the chance to see the private parts of Moses, and said: By Allah, Moses does not suffer from any ailment. The stone then stopped, till Moses had been seen by them, and he then took hold of his clothes and struck the stone. Abu Huraira said: By Allah, there are the marks of six or seven strokes made by Moses on the stone.
340.01 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:When the Ka'ba was constructed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abbas went and lifted stones.

He (the Holy Prophet) did this, but fell down upon the ground in a state of unconciousness and his eyes were turned towards the sky. He then stood up and said: My lower garment, my lower garment; and this wrapper was tied around him. In the hadith transmitted by Ibn Rafi', there is the word:" On his neck" and he did not say:" Upon his shoulder."
340.02 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was carrying along with them (his people) stones for the Ka'ba and there was a waist wrapper around him.

He (the Holy Prophet) took it off and placed it on his shoulder and fell down unconscious. He (the narrator) said: Never was he seen naked after that day.
341 | Al-Miswar b. Makhrama reported:I was carrying a heavy stone and my lower garment was loose, and it, therefore, slipped off (so soon) that I could not place the stone (on the ground) and carry to its proper place.

342 | 'Abdullah b.

Abu Musa said to Abdullah: You have not heard the words of 'Ammar: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent me on an errand and I had a seminal emission, but could find no water, and rolled myself in dust just as a beast rolls itself.

Once on hearing a man say: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked: He is following al-Fitra (al-Islam). Then hearing him say: I testify that there is no god but Allah. there is no god but Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You have come out of the Fire (of Hell). They looked at him and found that he was a goat herd.

If anyone who asks that I be given the Wasila, he will be assured of my intercession.
385 | 'Umar b. al-Khattab reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: When the Mu'adhdhin says: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, and one of you should make this response: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; (and when the Mu'adhdhin) says: I testify that there is no god but Allah, one should respond: I testify that there is no god but Allah, and when he says: I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, one should make a response: I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger. When he (the Mu'adhdhin) says: Come to prayer, one should make a response: There is no might and no power except with Allah. When he (the Mu'adhdhin) says: Come to salvation, one should respond: There is no might and no power except with Allah, and when he (the Mu'adhdhin) says: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, then make a response: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest.

386 | Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If anyone says on hearing the Mu'adhdhin: I testify that there is no god but Allah alone.

388.01 | Abu Sufyan reported it on the authority of Jabir that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say:When Satan hears the call to prayer, he runs away to a distance like that of Rauha. Sulaimin said: I asked him about Rauha. He replied: It is at a distance of thirty-six miles from Medina.

He said: If I knew that you would meet such a situation I would have never sent you (there), but (bear in wind) whenever you hear such a call (from the evil spirits) pronounce the Adhan. for I have heard Abu Huraira say that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upbn him) said: Whenever Adhan is proclaimed, Satan runs back vehemently.
389.04 | Abu Huraira reported:The Apostle (ﷺ) said When the call to prayer is made, Satan runs back and breaks wind so as not to hear the call being made, and when the call is finished. he turns round. When Iqama is proclaimed he turns his back, and when it is finished he turns round to distract a man, saying: Re- member such and such; remember such and such, referring to something the man did not have in his mind, with the result that he does not know how much he has prayed.
389.05 | A hadith like it has been narrated by Abu Huraira but for these words:" He (the man saying the prayer) does not know how much he has prayed.

He would do that throughout the whole prayer till he would complete it, and he would say the takbir when he would get up at the end of two rak'as after adopting the sitting posture. Abu Huraira said: My prayer has the best resemblance amongst you with the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
392.03 | Ibn al-Harith reported:He had heard Abu Huraira say: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited takbir on standing for prayer, and the rest of the hadith is like that transmitted by Ibn Juraij (recorded above), but he did not mention Abu Huraira as saying:" My prayer has the best resemblance amongst you with the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)."

He recited takbir when he prostrated, and he recited takbir when he raised his head and he recited takbir while rising up (from the sitting position at the end of two rak'ahs). When we had finished our prayer, 'Imran caught hold of my hand and said: He (Hadrat Ali) has led prayer like Muhammad (ﷺ) or he said: He in fact recalled to my mind the prayer of Muhammad (may peace be upon him.)
394.01 | 'Ubada b. as-Samit reported from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him ):He who does not recite Fatihat al-Kitab is not credited with having observed the prayer.
394.02 | Ubada b. as-Samit reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who does not recite Umm al-Qur'an is not credited with having observed the prayer.
394.03 | Mahmud b. al-Rabi', on whose face the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) squirted water from the well, reported on the authority of 'Ubada b. as- Samit that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:He who does not recite Umm al-Qur'an is not credited with having observed prayer.
394.04 | This hadith has also been transmitted by Ma'mar from al-Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters with the addition of these words:" and something more".
395.01 | Abu Huraira reported:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said: If anyone observes prayer in which he does not recite Umm al-Qur'an, It is deficient [he said this three times] and not complete. It was said to Abu Huraira: At times we are behind the Imam. He said: Recite it inwardly, for he had heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) declare that Allah the Exalted had said: I have divided the prayer into two halves between Me and My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks. When the servant says: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the universe, Allah the Most High says: My servant has praised Me. And when he (the servant) says: The Most Compassionate, the Merciful, Allah the Most High says: My servant has lauded Me. And when he (the servant) says: Master of the Day of judg- ment, He remarks: My servant has glorified Me. and sometimes He would say: My servant entrusted (his affairs) to Me. And when he (the worshipper) says: Thee do we worship and of Thee do we ask help, He (Allah) says: This is between Me and My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks for. Then, when he (the worshipper) says: Guide us to the straight path, the path of those to whom Thou hast been Gracious not of those who have incurred Thy displeasure, nor of those who have gone astray, He (Allah) says: This is for My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks for. Sufyan said: 'Ala b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Ya'qub narrated it to me when I went to him and he was confined to his home on account of illness, and I asked him about it.
395.02 | It is naratted on the authority of Abu Huraira that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say:He who observed prayer but he did not recite the Umm al-Qur'an in it, and the rest of the hadith is the same as transmitted by Sufyan, and in this hadith the words are:" Allah the Most High said: the prayer is divided into two halves between Me and My servant. The half of it is for Me and the half of it is for My servant."
395.03 | Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who said his prayer, but did not recite the opening chapter of al-Kitab, his prayer is incomplete. He repeated it thrice.
396.01 | Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: One is not credited with having observed the prayer without the recitation (of al-Fatiha). So said Abu Huraira: (The prayer in which) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited in a loud voice, we also recited that loudly for you (and the prayer in which) he recited inwardly we also recited inwardly for you (to give you a practical example of the prayer of the Holy Prophet).
396.02 | 'Ata' narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira who said that one should recite (al-Fatiha) in every (rak'ah of) prayer. What we heard (i. e. recitation) from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we made you listen to that. And that which he (recited) inwardly, we (recited) inwardly for you. A person said to him:If I add nothing to the (recitation) of the Umm al Qur'an (Surat al-Fatiha), would it make the prayer incomplete? He (AbuHuraira) said: If you add to that (if you recite some of verses of the Qur'an along with Surat at-Fatiha) that is better for you. But if you are contented with it (Surat al-Fatiha) only, it is sufficient for you.
396.03 | 'Ata' reported it on the authority of Abu Huraira who said:Recitation (of Surat al-Fatiha) in every (rak'ah) of prayer in essential. (The recitation) that we listened to from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) we made you listen to it. And that which he recited inwardly to us, we recited it inwardly for you. And he who recites Umm al-Qur'an, it is enough for him (to complete the prayer), and he who adds to it (recites some other verses of the Holy Qur'an along with Surat al-Fatiha), it is preferable for him.
397.01 | Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered the mosque and a person also entered therein and offered prayer, and then came and paid salutation to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Mes- senger of Allah (ﷺ) returned his salutation and said: Go back and pray, for you have not offered the prayer. He again prayed as he had prayed before, and came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon. him) and saluted him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned the salutation and said: Go back and say prayer, for you have not offered the prayer. This (act of repeating the prayer) was done three times. Upon this the person said: By Him Who hast sent you with Truth, whatever better I can do than this, please teach me. He (the Holy Prophet) said: When you get up to pray, recite takbir, and then recite whatever you conveniently can from the Qur'an, then bow down and remain quietly in that position, then raise your- self and stand erect; then prostrate yourself and remain quietly in that attitude; then raise yourself and sit quietly; and do that throughout all your prayers.
397.02 | Abu Huraira reported:A person entered the mosque and said prayer while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting in a nook (of the mosque), and the rest of the hadith is the same as mentioned above, but with this addition:" When you get up to pray, perform the ablution completely, and then turn towards the Qibla and recite takbir (Allah o Akbar =Allah is the Most Great)."
398.01 | lmrin b. Husain reported:The Messenger of Allah (may peace beupon him) led us In Zuhr or 'Asr prayer (noon or the afternoon prayer). (On concluding it) he said: Who recited behind me (the verses): Sabbih Isma Rabbik al-a'la (Glorify the name of thy Lord, the Most High)? There upon a person said: It was I, but I in- tended nothing but goodness. I felt that some one of you was disputing with me in it (or he was taking out from my tongue what I was reciting), said the Prophet (ﷺ).
398.02 | 'Imran b. Husain reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed the Zuhr prayer and a person recited Sabbih Isma Rabbik al-a'la (Glorify the name of thy Lord, the Most High) behind him. When he (the Holy Pro- phet) concluded the prayer he said: Who amongst you recited (the above-mentioned verse) or who amongst you was the reciter? A person said: It was I. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) observed: I thought as if someone amongst you was disputing with me (in what I was reciting).
398.03 | This hadith has been narrated by Qatada with the same chain of transmitters that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed Zuhr prayer and said:I felt that someone amongst you was disputing with me (in what I was reciting).
399.01 | Anas reported:I observed prayer along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and with Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman (may Allah be pleased with all of them), but I never heard any one of them reciting Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim loudly.
399.02 | Shu'ba reported it with the same chain of transmitters. with she addition of these words:" I said to Qatada: Did you hear it from Anas? He replied in the affir- mative and added: We had inquired of him about it."
399.03 | 'Abda reported:'Umar b. al-Khattab used to recite loudly these words: Subhanak Allahumma wa bi hamdika wa tabarakasmuka wa ta'ala jadduka wa la ilaha ghairuka [Glory to Thee,0 Allah, and Thine is the Praise, and Blessed is Thy Name. and Exalted is Thy Majesty. and there is no other object of worship beside Thee]. Qatada informed in writing that Anas b. Malik had narrated to him: I observed prayer behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr and Umar and 'Uthman. They started (loud recitation) with: AI-hamdu lillahi Rabb al-'Alamin [All Praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds] and did not recite Bismillah ir- Rahman-ir-Rahim (loudly) at the beginning of the recitation or at the end of it.
399.04 | It is reported on the authority of Abu Talha that he had heard Anas b. Malik narrating this.
400.01 | Anas reported:One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting amongst us that he dozed off. He then raised his head smilingly. We said: What makes you smile. Messenger of Allah? He said: A Sura has just been revealed to me, and then recited: In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Verily We have given thee Kauthar (fount of abundance). Therefore turn to thy Lord for prayer and offer sacrifice, and surely thy enemy is cut off (from the good). Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Do you know what Kauthar is? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: It (Kauthar) is a canal which my Lord, the Exalted and Glorious has promised me, and there is an abundance of good in it. It is a cistern and my people would come to it on the Day of Resurrection, and tumblers there would be equal to the number of stars. A servant would be turned away from (among the people gathered there). Upon this I would say: My Lord, he is one of my people, and He (the Lord) would say: You do not know that he innovated new things (in Islam) after you. Ibn Hujr made this addition in the hadith:" He (the Holy Prophet) was sitting amongst us in the mosque, and He (Allah) said: (You don't know) what he innovated after you"
400.02 | Mukhtar b. Fulful reported that he had heard Anas b. Malik say that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) dozed off, and the rest of the hadith is the same as transmitted by Mus-hir except for the words that he (the Holy Prophet) said:It (Kauthar) is a canal which my Lord the Exalted and the Glorious has promised me in Paradise. There is a tank over it, but he made no mention of the tumblers like the number of the stars.
401 | Wa'il b. Hujr reported:He saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raising his hands at the time of beginning the prayer and reciting takbir, and according to Hammam (the narrator), the hands were lifted opposite to ears. He (the Holy Prophet) then wrapped his hands in his cloth and placed his right hand over his left hand. And when he was about to bow down, he brought out his hands from the cloth, and then lifted them, and then recited takbir and bowed down, and when (he came back to the erect position) he recited:" Allah listened to him who praised Him." And when he prostrated, he prostrated between his two palms.
402.01 | `Abdullah (b. Mas`ud) said:While observing prayer behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) we used to recite: Peace be upon Allah, peace be upon so and so. One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to us: Verily Allah is Himself Peace. When any one of you sits during the prayer, he should say: All services rendered by words, by acts of worship, and all good things are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and blessings. Peace be upon us and upon Allah's upright servants, for when he says this it reaches every upright servant in the heavens and the earth. (And say further): I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. Then he may choose any supplication which pleases him and offer it.
402.02 | Shu'ba has narrated this on the authority of Mansur with the same chain of transmitters, but he made no mention of this:" Then he may choose any supplication which pleases him."
402.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Mansur with the same chain of transmitters and he made a mention of this:" Then he may choose any supplication which pleases him or which he likes."
402.04 | Abdullah b. Mas'ud reported:We were sitting with the Apostle (ﷺ) in prayer, and the rest of the hadith is the same as narrated by Mansur He (also said): After (reciting tashahud) he may choose any prayer.

403.01 | Ibn `Abbas reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to teach us tashahhud just as he used to teach us a Surah of the Qur'an, and he would say: All services rendered by words, acts of worship, and all good things are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and blessings. Peace be upon us and upon Allah's upright servants. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. In the narration of Ibn Rumh (the words are): "As he would teach us the Qur'an."
403.02 | Tawus narrated it on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to teach us tashahhud as he would teach us a Sura of the Qur'an.
404.01 | Hattan b. `Abdullah al-Raqashi reported:I observed prayer with Abu Musa al-Ash`ari and when he was in the qa`dah, one among the people said: The prayer has been made obligatory along with piety and Zakat. He (the narrator) said: When Abu Musa had finished the prayer after salutation he turned (towards the people) and said: Who amongst you said such and such a thing? A hush fell on the people. He again said: Who amongst you has said such and such a thing? A hush fell on the people. He (Abu Musa) said: Hattan, it is perhaps you that have uttered it. He (Hattan) said No. I have not uttered it. I was afraid that you might be annoyed with me on account of this. A person amongst the people said: It was I who said it, and in this I intended nothing but good. Abu Musa said: Don't you know what you have to recite in your prayers? Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us and explained to us all its aspects and taught us how to observe prayer (properly). He (the Holy Prophet) said: When you pray make your rows straight and let anyone amongst you act as your Imam. Recite the takbir when he recites it and when he recites: Not of those with whom Thou art angry, nor of those who go astray, say: Amin. Allah would respond you. And when he (the Imam) recites the takbir, you may also recite the takbir, for the Imam bows before you and raises himself before you. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The one is equivalent to the other. And when he says: Allah listens to him who praises Him, you should say: O Allah, our Lord, to Thee be the praise, for Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has vouchsafed (us) through the tongue of His Apostle (ﷺ) that Allah listens to him who praises Him. And when he (the Imam) recites the takbir and prostrates, you should also recite the takbir and prostrate, for the Imam prostrates before you and raises himself before you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The one is equivalent to the other. And when he (the Imam) sits for Qa`da (for tashahhud) the first words of every one amongst you should be: All services rendered by words, acts of worship and all good things are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Apostle, and Allah's mercy and blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the upright servants of Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger.
404.02 | Qatada has narrated a hadith like this with another chain of transmitters. In the hadith transmitted by Jarir on the authority of Sulaiman, Qatada's further words are:When (the Qur'an) is recited (in prayer), you should observe silence, and (the following words are) not found in the hadith narrated by anyone except by Abu Kamil who heard it from Abu 'Awina (and the words are): Verily Allah vouchsafed through the tongue of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) this: Allah listens to him who praises Him. Abu Ishaq (a student of Imam Muslim) said: Abu Bakr the son of Abu Nadr's sister has (critically) discussed this hadith. Imam Muslim said: Whom can you find a more authentic transmitter of hadith than Sulaiman? Abu Bakr said to him (Imam Muslim): What about the hadith narrated by Abu Huraira, i.e. the hadith that when the Qur'an is recited (in prayer) observe silence? He (Abu Bakr again) said: Then, why have you not included it (in your compilation)? He (Imam Muslim) said: I have not included in this every hadith which I deem authentic; I have recorded only such ahadith on which there is an agreement (amongst the Muhaddithin apart from their being authentic).
404.03 | This hadith has been transmitted by Qatida with the same chain of transmitters (and the words are):" Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, commanded it through the tongue of His Apostle (may peace be upon-him): Allah listens to him who praises Him."
405 | Abdullah b. Zaid-he who was shown the call (for prayer in a dream) narrated it on the authority of Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari who said:We were sitting in the company of Sa'id b. 'Ubida when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us. Bashir b. S'ad said: Allah has commanded us to bless you. Messenger of Allah! But how should we bless you? He (the narrator) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kept quiet (and we were so much perturbed over his silence) that we wished we had not asked him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: (For blessing me) say:" 0 Allah, bless Muhammad and the members of his household as Thou didst bless the mernbers of Ibrahim's household. Grant favours to Muhammad and the members of his household as Thou didst grant favours to the members of the household of Ibrahim in the world. Thou art indeed Praiseworthy and Glorious" ; and salutation as you know.

'Ujra met me and said: Should I not offer you a present (and added): The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us and we said: We have learnt how to invoke peace upon you; (kindly tell us) how we should bless you. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Say:" O Allah: bless Muhammad and his family as Thou didst bless the family of Ibrahim. Verily Thou art Praiseworthy and Glorious, O Allah."

411.01 | Anas b. Malik reported:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) fell down from a horse and his right side was grazed. We went to him to inquire after his health when the time of prayer came. He led us in prayer in a sitting posture and we said prayer behind him sitting, and when he finished the prayer hesaid: The Imam is appointed only to be followed; so when he recites takbir, you should also recite that; when he prostrates, you should also prostrate; when he rises up, you should also rise up, and when he said" God listens to him who praises Him," you should say:" Our Lord, to Thee be the praise," and when he prays sitting, all of you should pray sitting.

412.01 | 'A'isha reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fell ill and some of his Companions came to inquire after his health. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said prayer sitting, while (his Companions) said it (behind him) standing. He (the Holy Prophet) directed them by his gesture to sit down, and they sat down (in prayer). After finishing the (prayer) he (the Holy Prophet) said: The Imam is appointed so that he should be followed, so bow down when he bows down, and rise upp when he rises up and say (prayer) sitting when he (the Imam) says (it) sitting.
412.02 | This hadith is narrated with the same chain of transmitters by Hisham b. 'Urwa.
413.01 | Jabir reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was ill and we said prayer behind him and he was sitting. And Abu Bakr was making audible to the people his takbir. As he paid his attention towards us he saw us standing and (directed us to sit down) with a gesture. So we sat down and said our prayer with his prayer in a sitting posture. After uttering salutation he said: You were at this time about to do an act like that of the Persians and the Romans. They stand before their kings while they sit, so don't do that; follow your Imams. If they say prayer standing, you should also do so, and if they say prayer sitting, you should also say prayer sitting.
413.02 | Jabir said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led the prayer and Abu Bakr was behind him. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited the takbir, Abu Bakr also recited (it) in order to make it audible to us. And the rest of the hadith is like one transmitted by Laith.
414.01 | Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The Imam is appointed, so that he should be followed, so don't be at variance with him. Recite takbir when he recites it; bow down when he bows down and when he says:" Allah listens to him who praises Him," say:" O Allah, our Lord, to Thee be the Praise." And when he (the Imam) prostrates, you should also prostrate, and when he says prayer sitting, you should all observe prayer sitting.

417 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying:The Imam is appointed to be followed. So recite takbir when he recites it, and bow down when he bows down and when he utters:" Allah listens to him who praises Him," say" O Allah, our Lord, for Thee be the praise."

418.01 | Ubaidullah b. Abdullah reported:I visited 'A'isha and asked her to tell about the illness of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She agreed and said: The Apostle (ﷺ) was seriously ill and he asked whether the people had prayed. We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Put some water in the tub for me. We did accordingly and he (the Holy Prophet) took a bath;and, when he was about to move with difficulty, he fainted. When he came round, he again said: Have the people said prayer? We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) again said: Put some water for me in the tub. We did accordingly and he took a bag, but when he was about to move with difficultyhe fainted. When he came round, he asked whether the people had prayed. We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. He said: Put some water for me in the tub. We did accordingly and he took a bath and he was about to move with difficulty when he fainted. When he came roundhe said: Have the people saidprayer? We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. She ('A'isha) said: The people were staying in the mosque and waiting for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to lead the last (night) prayer. She ('A'isha) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent (instructions) to Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer. When the messenger came, he told him (Abd Bakr): The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has ordered you to lead the people in prayer. Abu Bakr who was a man of very tenderly feelings asked Umar to lead the prayer. 'Umar said: You are more entitled to that. Abu Bakr led the prayers during those days. Afterwards the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt some relief and he went out supported by two men, one of them was al-'Abbas, to the noon prayer. Abu Bakr was leading the people in prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him. he began to withdraw, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told him not to withdraw. He told his two (companions) to seat him down beside him (Abu Bakr). They seated him by the side of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr said the prayer standing while following the prayer of the Apostle (ﷺ) and the people Bald prayer (standing) while following the prayer of Abu Bakr. The Apostle (ﷺ) was seated. Ubaidullah said: I visited 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas, and said: Should I submit to you what 'A'isha had told about the illness of the Apostle (ﷺ)? He said: Go ahead. I submitted to him what had been transmitted by her ('A'isha). He objected to none of it, only asking whether she had named to him the man who accompanied al-'Abbas. I said: No. He said: It was 'Ali.
418.02 | 'A'isha reported:It was in the house ofMaimuna that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) first fell ill. He asked permission from his wives to stay in her ('A'isha's) house during his illness. They granted him permission. She ('A'isha) narrated: He (the Holy Prophet) went out (for prayer) with his hand over al-Fadl b. 'Abbas and on the other hand there was another person and (due to weakness) his feet dragged on the earth. 'Ubaidullah said: I narrated this hadith to the son of 'Abbas ('Abdullah b. 'Abbas) and he said: Do you know who the man was whose name 'A'isha did not mention? It was 'Ali.
418.03 | 'A'isha, the wife of the Apostle (ﷺ), said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fell ill and his illness became serious, he asked permission from his wives to stay in my house during his illness. They gave him permission to do so. He stepped out (of'A'isha's apartment for prayer) supported by two persons. (He was so much weak) that his feet dragged on the ground and he was being supported by 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib and another person. 'Ubaidullah said: I informed 'Abdullah (b. 'Abbas) about that which 'A'isha had said. 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas said: Do you know the man whose name 'A'isha did not mention? He said: No. Ibn 'Abbas said: It was 'Ali.
418.04 | 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said:I tried to dissuade the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from it (i. e. from appointing Abu Bakr as the Imam.) and my insistence upon it was not due to the fact that I entertained any apprehension in my mind that the people would not love the man who would occupy his (Prophet's) place (i. e. who would be appointed as his caliph) and I feared that the people would be superstitious about one who would occupy his place. I, therefore, desired that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) should leave Abu Bakr aside in this matter.
418.05 | 'A'isha reported:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to my house, he said: Ask Abu Bakr to lead people in prayer. 'A'isha narrated: I said, Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr is a man of tenderly feelings; as he recites the Qur'an, he cannot help shedding tears: so better command anyone else to lead the prayer. By Allah, there is nothing disturbing in it for me but the idea that the people may not takeevil omen with regard to one who is the first to occupy the place of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I tried to dissuade him (the Holy Prophet) twice or thrice (from appointing my father as an Imam in prayer), but he ordered Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer and said: You women are like those (who had) surrounded Yusuf.
418.06 | 'A'isha reported:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was confined to bed, Bilal came to him to summon him to prayer. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ask Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer. She ('A'isha) reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr is a tenderhearted man, when he would stand at your place (he would be so overwhelmed by feelings) that he would not be able to make the people hear anything (his recitation would not be audible to the followers in prayer). You should better order Umar (to lead the prayer). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ask Abu Bakr to lead people in prayer. She ('A'isha) said: I asked Hafsa to (convey) my impression to him (the Holy Prophet) that Abu Bakr was a tenderhearted man, so when he would stand at his place, he would not be able to make the people bear anything. He better order Umar. Hafsa conveyed this (message of Hadrat 'A'isha) to him (the Holy Prophet). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: (You are behaving) as if you are the females who had gathered around Yusuf. Order Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer. She ('A'isha) reported: So Abu Bakr was ordered to lead the people in prayer. As the prayer began, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) felt some relief; he got up and moved supported by two persons and his feet dragged on earth (due to excessive weakness). 'A'isha reported: As he (the Holy Prophet) entered the mosque. Abu Bakr perceived his (arrival). He was about to withdraw, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) by the gesture (of his hand) told him to keep standing at his place. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and seated himself on the left side of Abu Bakr. She ('A'isha) reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was leading people in prayer sitting. Abu Bakr was following the prayer of the Apostle (ﷺ) in a standing posture and the people were following the prayer of Abu Bakr.
418.07 | A'mash reported:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) suffered from illness of which he died, and in the hadith transmitted by Ibn Mus-hir, the words are: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was brought till he was seated by his (Abu Bakr's) side and the Apostle (ﷺ) led the people in prayer and Abu Bakr was making takbir audible to them, and in the hadith transmitted by 'Isa the (words are):" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat and led the people in prayer and Abu Bakr was by his side and he was making (takbir) audible to the people."
418.08 | `A'isha reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered Abu Bakr that he should lead people in prayer during his illness, and he led them in prayer. `Urwa said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt relief and went (to the mosque) and Abu Bakr was leading the people in prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him he began to withdraw, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) signaled him to remain where he was. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat opposite to Abu Bakr by his side. Abu Bakr said prayer following the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the people said prayer following the prayer of Abu Bakr.
419.01 | Anas b. Malik reported, Abu Bakr led them in prayer due to the illness of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) of which be died. It was a Monday and they stood in rows for prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) drew aside the curtain of ('A'isha's) apartment and looked at us while he was standing, and his (Prophet's) face was (as bright) as the paper of the Holy Book. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt happy and smiled. And we were confounded with joy while in prayer due to the arrival (among our midst) of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), Abu Bakr stepped back upon his heels to say prayer in a row perceiving that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had come out for prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with the help of his hand signed to them to complete their prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went back (to his apartment) and drew the curtain. He (the narrator) said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) breathed his last on that very day.
419.02 | Anas reported:The last glance that I have had of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (before his death) was that when he on Monday drew the curtain aside. The hadith transmitted by Salih is perfect and complete.
419.03 | This hadith is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik by another chain of transmitters.
419.04 | Anas reported:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) did not come to us for three days. When the prayer was about to start. Abu Bakr stepped forward (to lead the prayer), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lifted the curtain. When the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) became visible to us, we (found) that no sight was more endearing to us than the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as it appeared to us. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) with the gesture of his hand directed Abu Bakr to step forward (and lead the prayer). The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) then drew the curtain, and we could not see him till he died.
420 | Abu Musa reported:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) became ill and illness became serious he ordered Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer. Upon this 'A'isha said: Messenger of Allah, Abd Bakr is a man of tenderly feelings: when he would stand in your place (he would be so much overwhelmed -by grief that) he would not be able to lead the people in prayer. He (the Holy Prophet) said: You order Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer, and added: You are like the female companions of Yusuf. So Abu Bakr led the prayer (during this period of illness) in the life of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
421.01 | Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idi reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went to the tribe of Bani Amr b. Auf in order to bring reconciliation amongst (its members), and It was a time of prayer. The Mu'adhdhin came to Abu Bakr and said: Would you lead the prayer in case I recite takbir (tahrima, with which the prayer begins)? He (Abu Bakr) said: Yes. He (the narrator) said: He (Abu Bakr) started (leading) the prayer. The people were engaged in observing prayer when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) happened to come there and made his way (through the people) till he stood in a row. The people began to clap (their hands), but Abu Bakr paid no heed (to it) in prayer. When the people clapped more vigorously, he (Abu Bakr) then paid heed and saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) there. (He was about to withdraw when) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) signed to him to keep standing at his place. Abu Bakr lifted his hands and praised Allah for what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had commanded him and then Abu Bakr withdrew himself till he stood in the midst of the row and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stepped forward and led the prayer. When (the prayer) was over, he (the Holy Prophet) said: 0 Abu Bakr, what prevented you from standing (at that place) as I ordered you to do? Abu Bakr said: It does not become the son of Abu Quhafa to lead prayer before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said (to the people) around him: What is it that I saw you clapping so vigorously? (Behold) when anything happens in prayer, say: Subha Allah, for when you would utter it, it would attract the attention, while clapping of hands is meant for women.
421.02 | This hadith is transmitted by Sahl b. Sa'd in the same way as narrated by Malik, with the exception of these words:" Abu Bakr lifted his hands and praised Allah and retraced his (steps) till he stood in a row."
421.03 | Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idi reported:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) went to Bani Amr b. 'Auf in order to bring about reconciliation amongst them. The rest of the hadith is the same but with (the addition of these words):" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and made his way through the rows till he came to the first row and Abu Bakr retraced his steps."
274.12 | Mughira b. Shu'ba reported that he participated In the expedition of Tabuk along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to answer the call of nature before the morning prayer. and I carried along with him a jar (full of water). When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came back to me (after relieving himself). I began to pour water upon his hands out of the jar and he washed his hands three times, then washed his face three times. He then tried to tuck up the sleeves of his cloak upon his forearms but since the sleeves were tight he inserted his hands in the cloak and then brought out his forearms up to the elbow below the cloak, and then wiped over his shoes and then moved on. Mughira said:I also moved along with him till he came to the people and (he found) that they had been saying their prayer under the Imamah of 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) could get one rak ah out of two and said (this) last rak'ah along with the people. When Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf pronounced the salutation, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up to complete the prayer. This made the Muslims terrified and most of them began to recite the glory of the Lord. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he turned towards them and then said: You did well, or said with a sense of joy: You did the right thing that you said prayer at the appointed hour.
274.13 | This hadith is narrated by Hamza b. Mughira by another chain of trans- mitters (but with the addition of these words):I made up my mind to hold Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf back, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Leave him."

Does the observer of prayer not see how he is performing the prayer, for he performs it for himself? By Allah, I see behind me as I see in front of me.
424 | Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you find me seeing towards the Qibla only? By Allah, your bowing and your prostrating are not hidden from my view. Verily I see them behind my back.
425.01 | Anas b. Malik reported. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Perform bowing and prostration well. By Allah, I see you even if you are behind me, or he said: (I see you) behind my back when you bow or prostrate.
425.02 | Anas reported:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said: Complete the bowing and prostration well. By Allah, I see you behind my back as to how you bow and prostrate or when you bow and prostrate.
426.01 | Anas reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one day led us in the prayer. and when he completed the Prayer he turned his face towards us and said: 0 People, I am your Imam, so do not precede me in bowing and prostration and in standing and turning (faces, i. e. In pronouncing salutation), for I see you in front of me and behind me, and then said: By Him in Whose hand Is the life of Muhammad, if you could see what I see, you would have laughed little and wept much more. They said: What did you see, Messenger of Allah? He replied: (I saw) Paradise and Hell.

430.01 | Jabir b. Samura reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us and said: "How is it that I see you lifting your hands like the tails of headstrong horses? Be calm in prayer." He (the narrator) said: He then again came to us and saw us (sitting) in circles. He said: "How is it that I see you in separate groups?" He (the narrator) said: He again came to us and said: "Why don't you draw yourselves up in rows as angels do in the presence of their Lord?" We said: Messenger of Allah, how do the angels draw themselves up in rows in the presence of their Lord?

431.01 | Jabir b. Samura reported:When we said prayer with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we pronounced: Peace be upon you and Mercy of Allah, peace be upon you and Mercy of Allah, and made gesture with the hand on both the sides. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him said: What do you point out with your hands as if they are the tails of headstrong horses? This is enough for you that one should place one's hand on one's thigh and then pronounce salutation upon one's brother on the right side and then on the left.
431.02 | Jabir b. Samura reported:We said our prayer with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and, while pronouncing salutations, we made gestures with our hands (indicating)" Peace be upon you, peace be upon you." The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) looked towards us and said: Why is it that you make gestures with your hands like the tails of headstrong horses? When any one of you pro- nounces salutation (in prayer) he should only turn his face towards his companion and should not make a gesture with his hand.
432.01 | Abu Mas'ud reported:The Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) used to touch our shoulders in prayer and say: Keep straight, don't be irregular, for there would be dissension in your hearts. Let those of you who are sedate and prudent be near me, then those who are next to them, then those who are next to them. Abu Mas'ud said: Now-a-days there is much dissension amongst you.

Surely on us rests the collecting of it and the reciting of it" (ixxv. 16), i. e. Verily it rests with Us that We would preserve it in your heart and (enable you) to recite it You would recite it when We would recite it and so follow its recitation, and He (Allah) said:" We revealed it, so listen to it attentively. Verily its exposition rests with Us. i. e. We would make it deliver by your tongue."

Allah, the Exalted, revealed this:" Do not move your tongue therewith to make haste. It is with US that its collection rests and its recital" (al-Qur'an, ixxv. 16). He said: Its preservation in your heart and then your recital. So when We recite it, follow its recital. He said: Listen to it, and be silent and then it rests with Us that you recite it.

So they went forth and traversed the easts of the earth and its wests. Some of them proceeded towards Tihama and that is a nakhl towards the bazaar of 'Ukaz and he (the Holy Prophet) was leading his Companions in the morning prayer. So when they heard the Qur'an. they listened to it attentively and said: It is this which has caused obstruction between us and news from the Heaven. They went back to their people and said: O our people, we have heard a strange Qur'an which directs us to the right path; so we affirm our faith in it and we would never associate anyone with our Lord.

He (the narrator) said: He then went along with us and showed us their traces and traces of their embers. They (the Jinn) asked him (the Holy Prophet) about their provision and he said: Every bone on which the name of Allah is recited is your provision. The time it will fall in your hand it would be covered with flesh, and the dung of (the camels) is fodder for your animals. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Don't perform istinja with these (things) for these are the food of your brothers (Jinn).

Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you must not take graves as mosques; I forbid you to do that.
533.01 | Ubaidullah al-Khaulini reported:'Uthman b. 'Affan listened to the opinion of the people (which was not favourable) when he rebuilt the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

When we bowed, we placed our hands on our knees. He struck our hands and put his hands together, palm to palm, then put them between his thighs. When he completed the prayer he said. There would soon come your Amirs, who would defer prayers from their appointed time and would make such delay that a little time is left before sunset. So when you see them doing so, say prayer at its appointed time and then say prayer along with them as (Nafl), and when you are three, pray together (standing in one row), and when you are more than three, appoint one amongst you as your Imam. And when any one of you bows he must place his hands upon hie thighs and kneel down. and putting his palms together place (them within his thighs). I perceive as if I am seeing the gap between the fingers of the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him).

They began to strike their hands on their thighs, and when I saw them urging me to observe silence (I became angry) but I said nothing. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said the prayer (and I declare that neither before him nor after him have I seen a leader who gave better instruction than he for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom). I swear that he did not scold, beat or revile me but said: Talking to persons is not fitting during the prayer, for it consists of glorifying Allah, declaring his Greatness. and recitation of the Qur'an or words to that effect. I said: Messenger of Allah. I was till recently a pagan, but Allah has brought Islam to us; among us there are men who have recourse to Kahins. He said, Do not have recourse to them. I said. There are men who take omens. That is something which they find in their breasts, but let it not turn their way (from freedom of action). I said: Among us there are men who draw lines. He said: There was a prophet who drew lines, so if they do it as they did, that is allowable. I had a maid-servant who tended goats by the side of Uhud and Jawwaniya. One day I happened to pass that way and found that a wolf had carried a goat from her flock. I am after all a man from the posterity of Adam. I felt sorry as they (human beings) feel sorry. So I slapped her. I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and felt (this act of mine) as something grievous I said: Messenger of Allah, should I not grant her freedom? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Bring her to me. So I brought her to him. He said to her: Where is Allah? She said: He is in the heaven. He said: Who am I? She said: Thou art the Messenger of Allah.

When he finished the prayer, we said: Messenger of Allah, we heard you say something during the prayer which we have not heard you say before, and we saw you stretch out your hand. He replied: Allah's enemy Iblis came with a flame of fire to put it in my face, so I said three times:" I Seek refuge in Allah from thee." Then I said three times:" I curse thee with Allah's full curse." But he did not retreat (on any one of these) three occasions. Thereafter I meant to seize him. I swear by Allah that had it not been for the supplication of my brother Sulaiman he would have been bound, and made an object of sport for the children of Medina.

He then raised (his head from prostration) and stepped back (on his heels) till he prostrated himself at the base of pulpit, and then returned (to the former place and this movement of one or two steps continued) till the prayer was complete. He then turned towards the people and said: O people, I have done it so that you should follow me and learn (my mode of) prayer.

His caliphate and that with which He sent His Apostle (ﷺ) If death approaches me soon, the (issue) of Caliphate (would be decided) by the consent of these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained well pleased till his death. And I know fully well that some people would blame me that I killed with these very hands of mine some persons who apparently professed (Islam). And if they do this (blame me) they are the enemies of Allah, and are non-believers and have gone astray. And I leave not after me anything which to my mind seems more important than Kalala. And I never turned towards the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (for guidance) more often than this Kalala, and he (the Holy Prophet) was not annoyed with me on any other (issue) than this: (And he was so perturbed) that he struck his fingers on my chest and said: Does this verse. that is at the end of Surat al-Nisa'. which was revealed in the hot season not suffice you? And if I live longer I would decide this (problem so clearly) that one who reads the Qur'an, or one who does not read it, would be able to take (correct), decisions (under its light). He ('Umar) further said: Allah! I call You witness on these governors of lands, that I sent them to (the peoples of these lands) so that they should administer justice amongst them, teach them their religion and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and distribute amongst them the spoils of war and refer to me that which they find difficult to perform. O people. you eat 'these two plants and these are onions and garlic. and I find them nothing but repugnant for I saw that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sensed the odour of these two from a person in a mosque, he was made to go to al-Baqi'.

614.01 | Abu Musa narrated on the authority of his father that a person came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for inquiring about the times of prayers.

I inquired from 'Ata' how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) placed his hand upon his head as Ibn Abbas had informed. So Ata' spread his fingers a little and then placed the ends of his fingers on the side of his head. He then moved them like this over his head till the thumb touched that part of the ear which is near the face and then it (went) to the earlock and the part of the heard.

(The bedouin call it 'Atama because) they make delay in milling their she-camels.

648.01 | Abu Dharr reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: How would you act when you are under the rulers who would delay the prayer beyond its prescribed time, or they would make prayer a dead thing as far as its proper time is concerned? I said: What do you command? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Observe the prayer at Its proper time, and if you can say it along with them do so, for it would be a superetogatory prayer for you. Khalaf (one of the narrators in the above hadith) has not mentioned" beyond their (prescribed) time".
648.02 | Abu Dharr reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: O Abu Dharr, you would soon find after me rulers who would make their prayers dead. You should say prayer at its prescribed time.

648.03 | Abu Dharr reported:My friend (the Holy Prophet) bade me to hear and obey (the ruler) even if he is a slave having his feet and arms cut off, and observe prayer at its prescribed time. (And further said): It you find people having observed the prayer, you in fact saved your prayer, otherwise (if you join with them) that would be a Nafl prayer for you.
648.04 | Abu Dharr reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) struck my thigh and said: How would you act if you survive among the people who would delay prayers beyond their (prescribed) time? He (Abu Dharr) said: What do you command (under this situation)?

I have observed prayer and so I shall not pray."
648.06 | Abu Dharr reported:(The Messenger of Allah) said: How would you, or how would thou, act if you survive to live among people who defer prayer beyond the (prescribed) time? (The narrator said: Allah and His Messenger know best). whereupon he said: Observe prayer at its prescribed time, but if the Iqama is pronounced for (congregational) prayer, then observe prayer along with them. for herein is an excess of virtue.

650.04 | Ibn 'Umar reported from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as some and twenty (degrees).
651.01 | Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) found some people absenting from certain prayers and he said: I intend that I order (a) person to lead people in prayer, and then go to the persons who do not join the (congregational prayer) and then order their houses to be burnt by the bundles of fuel. If one amongst them were to know that he would find a fat fleshy bone he would attend the night prayer.
651.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The most burdensome prayers for the hypocrites are the night prayer and the morning prayer. If they were to know the blessings they have in store, they would have come to them, even though crawling, and I thought that I should order the prayer to be commenced and command a person to lead people in prayer, and I should then go along with some persons having a fagot of fuel with them to the people who have not attended the prayer (in congregation) and would burn their houses with fire.
651.03 | Hammam b. Munabbih reported:This is what Abu Huraira reported to us from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and (in this connection) he narrated some ahadith, one of them is: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I intend that I should command my young men to gather bundles fuel for me, and then order a person to lead people in prayer, and then burn the houses with their inmates (who have not joined the congregation).
651.04 | A hadith like this has been narrated by Abu Huraira.

He said: Yes. He (the Prophet then) said: Respond to it.
654.01 | 'Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) reported:I have seen the time when no one stayed away from prayer except a hypocrite, whose hypocrisy was well known, or a sick man, but if a sick man could walk between two persons (i.e. with the help of two persons with one on each side) he would come to prayer. And (further) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught us the paths of right guidance, among which is prayer in the mosque in which the Adhan is called.
654.02 | Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) reported:He who likes to meet Allah tomorrow as Muslim, he should persevere in observing these prayers, when a call is announced for them, for Allah has laid down for your Prophet the paths of right guidance, and these (prayers) are among the paths of right guidance. If you were to pray in your houses as this man why stays away (from the mosque) prays in his house, you would abandon the practice of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the practice of your Prophet, you would go astray. No man purifies himself, doing it well, then makes for one of those mosques without Allah recording a blessing for him for every step he takes raising him a degree for it, and effacing a sin from him for it. I have seen the time when no one stayed away from it, except a hypocrite, who was well known for his hypocrisy, whereas a man would be brought swaying (due to weakness) between two men till he was set up in a row.
655.01 | Abu Sha'tha' reported:While we were sitting with Abu Huraira in a mosque a man went out of the mosque after the call to prayer had been announced. (A man stood up in the mosque and set off.)

I also sat alone with him, so he said: 0, son of my brother, I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: He who observed the 'Isha' prayer in congregation, it was as if he prayed up to midnight, and he who prayed the morning prayer in congregation, it was as if he prayed the whole night.
656.02 | This hadith has been narrated by the chain of transmitters by Abu Sahl 'Uthman b. Hakim.
657.01 | Jundab b. 'Abdullah reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:He who prayed the morning prayer (in congregation) he is in fact under the protection of Allah. And it can never happen that Allah should demand anything from you in connection with the protection (that He guarantees) and one should not get it. He would then throw him in the fire of Hell.
657.02 | Anas b. Sirin reported:I heard Jundab b. Qasri saying that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who observed the morning prayer (in congregation), he is in fact under the protection of Allah and it never happens that Allah should make a demand in connection with the protection (that He guarantees and should not get it) for when he asks for anything in relation to His protection, he definitely secures it. He then throws him flatly in the Hell-fire.
657.03 | This hadith has been narrated by Jundab b. Sufyan in from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with the same chain of transmitters, but this has not been mentioned:" He would throw him in fire."
33.03 | Mahmud b. al-Rabi' reported that 'Ibn b. Malik, who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and who participated in the (Battle of) Badr and was among the Ansar (of Medina), told that he came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said:Messenger of Allah, I have lost my eyesight and I lead my people in prayer. When there is a downpour there is then a current (of water) in the valley that stands between me and them and I find it impossible to go to their mosque and lead them in prayer. Messenger of Allah, I earnestly beg of you that you should come and observe prayer at a place of worship (in my house) so that I should then use it as a place of worship. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Well, it God so wills. I would soon do so. 'Itban said: On the following day when the day dawned, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) came along with Abu Bakr at-Siddiq, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked permission (to get into the house). I gave him the permission, and be did not sit after entering the house, when he said: At what place in your house you desire me to say prayer? I ('Itban b. Malik) said: I pointed to a corner in the house, The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood (at that place for prayer) and pronounced Allah-o-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) (as an expression for the commencement of prayer). We too stood behind him, and he said two rak'ahs and then pronounced salutation (marking the end of the prayer). We detained him (the Holy Prophet) for the meat curry we had prepared for, him. The people of the neighbouring houses came and thus there was a good gathering in (our house). One of them said: Where is Malik b. Dukhshun? Upon this one of them remarked: He is a hypocrite; he does not love Allah and His Messenger. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do not say so about him. Don't you see that he utters La ilaha ill-Allah (There is no god but Allah) and seeks the pleasure of Allah through it? They said: Allah and His Messenger know beet. One (among the audience) said: We see his inclination and wellwishing for hypocrites only. Upon this the Messenger of Allah' (ﷺ) again said: Verily Allah has forbidden the Fire for one who says: There is no god but Allah, thereby seeking Allah's pleasure. Ibn Shihab said: I asked Husain b. Muhammad al-Ansar (he was one of the leaders of Banu Salim) about the hadith transmitted by Mahmud b. Rabi' and he testified it.
33.04 | 'Itban b. Malik reported:I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the rest of the hadith is the same as narrated (above) except this that a man said: Where is Malik b. Dukhshun or Dukhaishin, and also made this addition that Mahmud said: I narrated this ver hadith to many people and among them was Abu Ayyub al-Ansari who said: I cannot think that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) could have said so as you say. He (the narrator) said: I took an oath that if I ever go to 'Itban. I would ask him about it. So I went to him and found him to be a very aged man, having lost his eyesight, but he was the Imam of the people. I sat by his side and asked about this hadith and he narrated it In the same way as he had narrated it for the first time.

Hisham; O Allah! rescue 'Ayyash b. Abu Rabi'a; O Allah! rescue the helpless amongst the Muslims; O Allah! trample Mudar severely; O Allah! cause them a famine like that (which was caused at the time) of Joseph." Abu Huraira (further) said: I saw that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) afterwards abandoned this supplication. I, therefore said: I see the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) abandoning this blessing upon them.

He told Bilal to remain on guard during the night and he (Bilal) prayed as much as he could, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions slept. When the time for dawn approached Bilal leaned against his camel facing the direction from which the dawn would appear but he was overcome by sleep while he was leaning against his camel, and neither the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) nor Bilal, nor anyone else among his Companions got up, till the sun shone on them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was the first of them to awake and, being startled, he called to Bilal who said:Messenger of Allah I may my father and mother be offered as ransom for thee, the same thing overpowered me which overpowered you. He (the Holy Prophet, then) said: Lead the beasts on: so they led their camels to some distance. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then performed ablution and gave orders to Bilal who pronounced the Iqama and then led them in the morning prayer. When he finished the prayer he said: When anyone forgets the prayer, he should observe it when he remembers it, for Allah has said:" And observe the prayer for remembrance of Me" (Qur'an. xx. 14). Yunus said: Ibn Shilab used to recite it like this:" (And observe the prayer) for remembrance."
680.02 | Abu Huraira reported:We stopped for rest along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and did not awake till the sun rose. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) then told us that everybody should take hold of his camel's nosestring (get out of this ground) for it was the place where devil had visited us. We did accordingly. He then called for water and performed ablution and then performed two prostrations. Ya'qub said: Then he prayed (performed) two prostrations. then takbir was pronounced for prayer and then he offered the morning prayer (in congregation).
681 | Abu Qatida reported:The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) addressed us and said: You would travel In the evening and the might till (God willing) you would come in the morning to a place of water. So the people travelled (self absorbed) without paying any heed to one another, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) also travelled till It was midnight. I was by his side. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to doze and leaned (to one side) of his camel. I came to him and I lent him support without awaking him till he sat poised on his ride. He went on travelling till a major part of the night was over and (he again) leaned (to one side) of his camel. I supported him without awaking him till he sat" bed on his ride. and then travelled till it was near dawn. He (again) leaned which was far more inclined than the two earlier leanings and he was about to fall down. So I came to him and supported him and he lifted his head and said; Who is this? I said: it is Abu Qatida. He (the Prophet again) said: Since how long have you been travelling along with me like this? I said: I have been travelling in this very state since the night. He said: May Allah protect you, as you have protected His Apostle (from falling down), and again said: Do you see that we are hidden from the people? - and again said: Do you see anyone? I said: Here is a rider. I again said: Here Is another rider till we gathered together and we were seven riders. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stepped aside of the highway and placed his head (for sleep and said): Guard for us our prayers. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was the first to wake up and the rays of the sun were falling on his back. We got up startled He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ride on So we rode on till the sun had (sufficiently) risen. He then came down from his camel and called for a jug of water which I had with me. There was a little water in that. He performed ablution with that which was less thorough as compared with his usual ablutions and some water of that had been left. He (the Holy Prophet) said to Abu Qatida: Keep a watch over your jug of water; it would have (a miraculous) condition about it. Then Bilal summoned (people) to prayer and then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed two rak'ahs and then said the morning prayer as he said every day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (then) rode on and we rode along with him and some of us whispered to the others saying: How would there be compensation for omission in our prayers? Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) said: Is there not in me (my life) a model for you? There is no omission in sleeping. The (cognizable) emission is that one should not say prayer (intentionally) till the time of the other prayer comes. So he who did like it (omitted prayer in sleep or due to other unavoidable circumstances) should say prayer when he becomes aware of it and on the next day he should observe it at its prescribed time. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What do you think the people would have done (at this hour)? They would have in the morning found their Apostle missing from amongst them and then Abu Bakr and 'Umar would have told them that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) must be behind you, he cannot leave you behind (him), but the people said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is ahead of you. So if you had obeyed Abu Bakr and Umar, you would have gone on the right path. So we proceeded on till we came up to the people (from whom we had lagged behind) and the day had considerably risen and everything became hot, and they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Messenger of Allah, we are dying of thirst. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: There is no destruction for you. And again said: Bring that small cup of mine and he then asked for the jug of water to be brought to him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to pour water (in that small cup) and Abu Qatida gave them to drink. And when the people saw that there was (a little) water in the jug, they fell upon it. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Behave well; the water (is enough) to satiate all of you. Then they (the Companions) began to receive (their share of) water with calmness (without showing any anxiety) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to fill (the cap), and I began to serve them till no one was left except me and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He then filled (the cup) with water and said to me: Drink it. I said: Messenger of Allah, I would not drink till you drink. Upon this he said: The server of the people Is the last among them to drink. So I drank and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) also drank and the people came to the place of water quite happy and satiated. 'Abdullah b. Rabah said: I am going to narrate this hadith in the great mosque, when 'Imran b. Husain said: See, O young man, how will you narrate for I was also one of the riders on that night? I said: So you must be knowing this hadith well. He said: Who are you? I said: I am one of the Ansar. Upon this he said: You narrate, for you know your hadith better. I, therefore, narrated it to the people. 'Imran said: I was also present that night, but I know not anyone else who learnt it so well as you have learnt.
682.01 | 'Imran b. Husain reported:I was with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a journey. We travelled the whole of the night, and when it was about to dawn, we got down for rest, and were overpowered (by sleep) till the sun shone. Abu Bakr was the first to awake amongst us. and we did not awake the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from his sleep allowing him to wake up (of his own accord). It was 'Umar who then woke up. He stood by the side of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and recited takbir in a loud voice till the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) woke up. When he lifted his head, he saw that the sun had arisen; he then said: Proceed on. He travelled along with us till the sun shone brightly. He came down (from his camel) and led us in the morning prayer. A person, however, remained away from the people and did not say, prayer along with us. After having completed the prayer, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: O, so and so, what prevented you from observing prayer with us? He said: Apostle of Allah! I was not in a state of purity. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered him arid lie performed Tayammum with dust and said prayer. He then urged me to go ahead immediately along with other riders to find out water, for we felt very thirsty. We were traveling when we came across a woman who was sitting (on a camel) with her feet hanging over two leathern water bags. We said to her: How far is water available? She, said: Far, very far, very far. You cannot get water. We (again) said: How much distance is there between (the residence of) your family and water? She said: It is a day and night journey. We said to her: You go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said: Who is the Messenger of Allah? We somehow or the other managed to bring her to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he asked about her, and she informed him as she had informed us that she was a widow having orphan children. He ordered that her camel should be made to kneal down and he gargled in the opening (of her leathern water-bag). The camel was then raised up and we forty thirsty men drank water till we were completely satiated, and we filled up all leathern water-bags and water-skins that we had with us and we washed our companions, but we did not make any camel drink, and (the leathern water-bags) were about to burst (on account of excess of water). He then said: Bring whatever you have with you. So we collected the bits (of estable things) and dates and packed them up in a bundle, and said to her: Take it away.

But (one of the narrators) Ibn Bashshar in his narration made no mention of the word:" Never".
336.05 | 'Abdullah b. Harith b. Naufal reported:I had been asking about, as I was desirous to find one among people who should inform me, whether the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed the forenoon prayer, but I found none to narrate that to me except Umm Hani, daughter of Abu Talib (the real sister of Hadrat 'Ali), who told me that on the day of the Conquest the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came (to our house) after the dawn had (sufficiently) arisen. A cloth was brought and privacy was provided for him (the Holy Prophet). He took a bath and then stood up and observed eight rak'ahs. I do not know whether his Qiyam (standing posture) was longer, or bending or prostration or all of them were of equal duration. She (Umm Hani) further said: I never saw him saying this Nafl prayer prior to it or subsequently. (Al-Muradi narrated on the authority of Yunus that he made no mention of the words:" He informed me." )

I gave him salutation and he said: Who is she? I said: It is Umm Hani, daughter of Abu Talib. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Greeting for Umm Hani. When he had completed the bath, he stood up and observed eight rak'ahs wrapped up in one cloth. When he turned back (after the prayer), I said to him: Messenger of Allah, the son of my mother 'Ali b. Abu Talib is going to kill a person, Fulan b. Hubaira whom I have given protection. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We too have given protection whom you have given protection, O Umm Hani. Umm Hani said: It was the forenoon (prayer).

720 | Abu Dharr reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:In the morning charity is due from every bone in the body of every one of you. Every utterance of Allah's glorification is an act of charity. Every utterance of praise of Him is an act of charity, every utterance of profession of His Oneness is an act of charity, every utterance of profession of His Greatness is an act of charity, enjoining good is an act of charity, forbidding what is distreputable is an act of charity, and two rak'ahs which one prays in the forenoon will suffice.

I said: Messenger of Allah, it has been narrated to me that you said: The prayer of a man in a sitting position is half of the prayer, whereas you are observing prayer sitting. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes, it is so, but I am not like anyone amongst you.
735.02 | A hadith like this has been narrated by Abu Yahya al-A'raj with the same chain of transmitters.
736.01 | 'A'isha reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray eleven rak'ahs at night, observing the Witr with a single rak'ah, and when he had finished them, he lay down on his right side, till the Mu'adhdhin came to him and he (the Holy Prophet) then observed two short rak'ahs (of Sunan of the dawn prayer).
736.02 | 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said that between the time when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished the 'Isha' prayer which is called 'Atama by the people, he used to pray eleven rak'ahs, uttering the salutation at the end of every two rak'ahs, and observing the Witr with a single one. And when the Mu'adhdhin had finished the call (for the) dawn prayer and he saw the dawn clearly and the Mu'adhdhin had come to him, he stood up and prayed two short rak'ahs. Then he lay down on his right side till the Mu'adhdhin came to him for lqama.

Ask not about their excellence and their length (i. e. these were matchless in perfection and length). He again observed four rak'ahs, and ask not about their excellence and their length. He would then observe three rak'ahs (of the Witr prayer). 'A'isha again said: I said: Messenger of Allah, do you sleep before observing the Witr prayer? He said: O 'A'isha, my eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.
738.02 | Abu Salama asked 'A'isha about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) She said:He observed thirteen rak'ahs (in the night prayer). He observed eight rak'ahs and would then observe Witr and then observe two rak'ahs sitting, and when he wanted to bow he stood up and then bowed down, and then observed two rak'ahs in between the Adhan and lqama of the dawn prayer.
738.03 | Abu Salama reported that he asked 'A'isha about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) (during the night). The rest of the hadith is the same but with this exception that he (the Holy Prophet) observed nine rak'ahs including Witr.
738.04 | Abu Salama is reported to have said. I came to 'A'isha. I said:O mother, inform me about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said: His (night prayer) in Ramadan and (during other months) was thirteen rak'ahs at night including two rak'ahs of fajr.
738.05 | It is reported on the authority of 'A'isha that the prayer of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the night consisted of ten rak'ahs. He observed a Witr and two rak'ahs (of Sunan) of the dawn prayer, and thus the total comes to thirteen rak'ahs.
739 | 'A'isha thus reported about the (night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ):He used to sleep in the early part of the night, and woke up in the latter part. If he then wished intercourse with his wife, he satisfied his desire, and then went to sleep; and when the first call to prayer was made he jumped up (by Allah, she, i. e. 'A'isha, did not say" he stood up" ), and poured water over him (by Allah she, i. e. 'A'isha, did not say that he took a bath but I know what she meant) and if he did not have an intercourse, he performed ablution, just as a man performs ablution for prayer and then observed two rak'ahs.
740 | 'A'isha observed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to observe prayer in the night and the last of his (night) prayer was Witr.
741 | Masruq is reported to have asked 'A'isha about the action (most pleasing to) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said:He (the Holy Prophet) loved (that action) which one keeps on doing regularly. I said (to 'A'isha): When did he pray (at night)? She replied: When he heard the cock crow, he got up and observed prayer.
742 | 'A'isha reported:Never did the earlier part of the dawn find the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) but sleeping in my house or near me.

746.01 | Sa'd b. Hisham b. 'Amir decided to participate in the expedition for the sake of Allah, so he came to Medina and he decided to dispose of his property there and buy arms and horses instead and fight against the Romans to the end of his life. When he came to Medina, he met the people of Medina. They dissuaded him to do such a thing, and informed him that a group of six men had decided to do so during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade them to do it, and said:Is there not for you a model pattern in me? And when they narrated this to him (Sa'd b. Hisham), he returned to his wife, though he had divorced her and made (people) witness to his reconciliation. He then came to Ibn 'Abbas and asked him about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Ibn 'Abbas said: Should I not lead you to one who knows best amongst the people of the world about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: Who is it? He (Ibn 'Abbas) said: It is 'A'isha. So go to her and ask her (about Witr) and then come to me and inform me about her answer that she would give you. So I came to Hakim b. Aflah and requested him to take me to her. He said: I would not go to her, for I forbade her to speak anything (about the conflict) between the two groupS, but she refused (to accept my advice) and went (to participate in that corflict). I (requested) him (Hakim) with an oath to lead me to her. So we went to 'A'isha and we begged permission to meet her. She granted us permission and we went in. She said: Are you Hakim? (She recognised him.) He replied: Yes. She said: Who is there with you? He said: He is Sa'd b. Hisham. She said: Which Hisham? He said: He is Hisham b. 'Amir. She blessed him ('Amir) with mercy from Allah and spoke good of him (Qatada said that he died as a martyr in Uhud). I said: Mother of the Faithful, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said: Don't you read the Qur'an? I said: Yes. Upon this she said: The character of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was the Qur'an. He said: I felt inclined to get up and not ask anything (further) till death. But then I changed my mind and said: Inform me about the observance (of the night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said: Did you not recite:" O thou wrapped up"? He said: Yes. She said: Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, made the observance of the night prayer at the beginning of this Surah obligatory. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him and his Companions around him observed this (night prayer) for one year. Allah held back the concluding portion of this Surah for twelve months in the Heaven till (at the end of this period) Allah revealed the concluding verses of this Surah which lightened (the burden of this prayer), and the night prayer became a supererogatory prayer after being an obligatory one. I said: Mother of the Faithful, inform me about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said: I used to prepare tooth stick for him and water for his ablution, and Allah would rouse him to the extent He wished during the night. He would use the tooth stick, and perform ablution, and would offer nine rak'ahs, and would not sit but in the eighth one and would remember Allah, and praise Him and supplicate Him, then he would get up without uttering the salutation and pray the ninth rak'ah. He would then sit, remember, praise Him and supplicate Him and then utter a salutation loud enough for us to hear. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made eleven rak'ahs. O my son, but when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) grew old and put on flesh, he observed Witr of seven, doing in the two rak'ahs as he had done formerly, and that made nine. O my son, and when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed prayer, he liked to keep on observing it, and when sleep or pain overpowered him and made it impossible (for him) to observe prayer in the night, he prayed twelve rak'ahs daring the day. I am not aware of Allah's Prophet (ﷺ) having recited the whole Qur'an during one single night, or praying through the night till morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan. He (the narrator) said: I then went to Ibn 'Abbas and narrated to him the hadith (transmitted from her), and he said: She says the truth If I went to her and got into her presence, I would have listened to it orally from her. He said: If I were to know that you do not go to her. I would not have transmitted this hadith to you narrated by her.
746.02 | Zurara b. Aufa said that Sa'd b. Hisham divorced his wife, and then proceeded to Medina to sell his property, and the rest of the hadith is the same.
746.03 | Sa'd b. Hisham reported:I went to 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas and asked him about the Witr prayer, and the rest of the hadith is the same as recorded in this event. She (Hadrat 'A'isha) said: Who is that Hisham? I said: Son of 'Amir. She said: What a fine man 'Amir was! He died as a martyr in the Battle of Uhud.
746.04 | Zurara b. Aufa reported that Sa'd b. Hisham was his neighbour and he informed him that he had divorced his wife and he narrated the hadith like the one transmitted by Sa'd. She ('A'isha) said:Who is Hisham? He said: The son of 'Amir. She said: What a fine man he was; he participated in the Battle of Uhud along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Hakim b. Aflah said: If I ever knew that you do not go to 'A'isha, I would not have informed you about her hadith (So that you would have gone to her and heard it from her orally).
746.05 | 'A'isha reported that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) missed the night prayer due to pain or any other reason, he observed twelve rak'ahs during the daytime.

748.01 | Zaid b. Arqam, on seeing some people praying in the forenoon, said:They well know that prayer at another time than this is more excellent, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The prayer of those who are penitent is observed when your weaned camels feel the heat of the sun.
748.02 | Zaid b. Arqam reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to the people of Quba' and saw them observing prayer; upon this he said:The prayer of the penitent should be observed when the young weaned camels feel heat of the sun.

749.02 | Salim reported on the authority of his father that a person asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the night prayer. He said:It consists of pairs of rak'ahs, but if one fears morning is near, he should make it an odd number by praying one rak'ah.
749.03 | 'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported:A man stood up and said. Messenger of Allah, how is the night prayer? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The night prayer consists of pair, but if you apprehend the rise of dawn, make it odd number by observing one rak'ah.
749.04 | 'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported:A person asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as I stood between him (the Holy Prophet) and the inquirer and he said: Messenger of Allah, how is the night prayer? He (the Holy Prophet) said: It consists of pairs of rak'ahs, but if you apprehend morning, you should pray one rak'ah and make the end of your prayer as Witr. Then a person asked him (the Holy Prophet) at the end of the year and I was at that place near the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ; but I do not know whether he was the same person or another person, but he (the Holy Prophet) gave him the same reply.
749.05 | This hadith his been narrated by Ibn 'Umar by another chain of trans- mitters but it does not have these words:" Then a person asked him at the end of the year," and what follows subsequently.
750 | Ibn 'Umar reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as say- ing:Hasten to pray Witr before morning.

749.06 | Ibn 'Umar reported:A person called (the attention) of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as he was in the mosque, and said: Messenger of Allah, how should I make the rak'ahs of the night prayer an odd number? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said: He who prays (night prayer) he should observe it in pairs, but if he apprehends the rise of morning, he should observe one rak'ah; that would make the number odd (for the rak'ahs) observed by him. This was narrated by Abu Kuraib 'Ubaidullah b. 'Abdullah and Ibn 'Umar did not make mention of it.
749.07 | Anas b. Sirin reported:I asked Ibn 'Umar to tell me about the practice of the Prophet (ﷺ) in regard to two rak'ahs before the dawn prayer: Should I make lengthy recitation in them? He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to observe, the night prayer in pairs and then made the number odd by observing one rak'ah. I said: I am not asking you about it. He said: You are a bulky man, will you not show me the patience to narrate to you the hadith completely? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to observe the night prayer in pairs and then made the number odd by observing one rak'ah, and then he observed two rak'ahs before dawn quite close to the call for prayer (Khalaf said:" Did you see [yourself the Prophet observing] the two rak'ahs before the dawn?" and he made no mention of prayer.)
749.08 | Anas b. Sirin reported:I asked Ibn 'Umar like this (as recorded in the previous hadith) and he made this addition:" And he (the Holy Prophet) made the end of the night prayer as odd number by one rak'ah." And there is also (this addition):" Stop, stop, you are bulky."
749.09 | Ibn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The night prayer consists of pairs and when you see the approach of dawn, make this number odd by one rak'ah. It was said to Ibn 'Umar: What does the (word) pair imply? He said: (It means) that salutation is uttered after every two rak'ahs.
754.01 | Abu Sa'id (al Khudri) reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:Observe Witr prayer before it is morning. Abu Sa'id reported that they (the Prophet's Companions) asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about Witr (prayer). (In reply to their inquiry) he said: Observe Witr prayer before it is morning.
754.02 | Abu Sa'id reported that they (some of the Companions) of the Prophet (ﷺ) asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about Witr. He said:Observe Witr before morning.
755.01 | Jabir reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone is afraid that he may not get up in the latter part of the night, he should observe Witr in the first part of it; and if anyone is eager to get up in the last part of it, he should observe Witr at the end of the night, for prayer at the end of the night is witnessed (by the angels) and that is preferable.
755.02 | Jabir reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:He who amongst you is afraid that he may not be able to get up at the end of the night should observe Witr (in the first part) and then sleep, and he who is confident of getting up and praying at night (i. e. Tahajjud prayer) should observe it at the end of it, for the recitation at the end of the night is witnessed*, and that is better. *: meaning, "by angels" (Sharh an-Nawawi)
756.01 | Jabir reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The most excellent prayer is that in which the duration of standing is longer.
756.02 | Jabir reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked about the prayer which was most excellent. He said: That in which the standing is longer. (This hadith is narrated by another chain of transmitters too.)
757.01 | Jabir said he heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say:There is an hour during the night in which no Muslim individual will ask Allah for good in this world and the next without His giving it to him; and that applies to every night.
757.02 | Jabir reported:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: There is an hour during the night in which no Muslim bondman will ask Allah for good in this world and the next but He will grant it to him.
758.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Our Lord, the Blessed and the Exalted, descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the latter part of the night is left, and says: Who supplicates Me so that I may answer him? Who asks Me so that I may give to him? Who asks Me forgiveness so that I may forgive him?
758.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the first part of the night is over and says: I am the Lord; I am the Lord: who is there to supplicate Me so that I answer him? Who is there to beg of Me so that I grant him? Who is there to beg forgiveness from Me so that I forgive him? He continues like this till the day breaks.
758.03 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:When half of the night or two-third of it is over. Allah, the Blessed and the Exalted, descends to the lowest heaven and says: Is there any beggar, so that he be given? Is there any supplicator so that he be answered? Is there any beggar of forgiveness so that he be forgiven? (And Allah continues it saying) till it is daybreak.
758.04 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Allah descends to the lowest heaven at half of the night or at one-third of the latter part and says: Who is there to supplicate Me so that I answer him? Who is there to ask Me so that I grant him? And then says: Who will lend to One Who is neither indigent nor tyrant? (This hadith has been narrated by Sa'd b. Sa'id with the same chain of transmitters with this addition:" Then the Blessed and the Exalted (Lord) stretches His Hands and says: Who will lend to One Who is neither indigent nor tyrant? )
758.05 | Abu Sa'id and Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Allah waits till when one-third of the first part of the night is over; He descends to the lowest heaven and says: It there any supplicator of forgiveness? Is there any penitant? Is there any petitioner (for mercy and favour)? Is there any solicitor? -till it is daybreak.
758.06 | This hadith is narrated by Ishaq with the same chain uf transmitters except this that the hadith transmitted by Mansur (the above one) is more comprehensive and lengthy.
759.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:He who observed prayer at night during Ramadan, because of faith and seeking his reward from Allah, his previous sins would be forgiven.
759.02 | Abu Huraira reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to exhort (his Companions) to pray (at night) during Ramadan without commanding them to observe it as an obligatory act, and say: He who observed the night prayer in Ramadan because of faith and seeking his reward (from Allah), all his previous sins would be forgiven. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) died, this was the practice, and it continued thus during Abu Bakr's caliphate and the early part of 'Umar's caliphate.
760.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:He who observed the fasts of Ramadan with faith and seeking reward (from Allah), all his previous sins would be forgiven, and he who observed prayer on Lailat-ul- Qadr with faith and seeking reward (from Allah), all his previous sins would be forgiven.
760.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:He who prayed on the Lailat-ul-Qadr (the Majestic Night) knowing that it is (the same night). I (believe) that he (the Prophet also) said: (He who does) it with faith and seeking reward (from Allah), his sins would be forgiven.
761.01 | 'A'isha reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed one night in the mosque and people also prayed along with him. He then prayed on the following night and there were many persons. Then on the third or fourth night (many people) gathered there, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come out to them (for leading the Tarawih prayer). When it was morning he said:I saw what you were doing, but I desisted to come to you (and lead the prayer) for I feared that this prayer might become obligatory for you. (He the narrator) said: It was the month of Ramadan.
761.02 | 'A'isha reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out during the night and observed prayer in the mosque and some of the people prayed along with him. When it was morning the people talked about this and so a large number of people gathered there. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out for the second night, and they (the people) prayed along with him. When it was morning the people began to talk about it. So the mosque thronged with people on the third night. He (the Holy Prophet) came out and they prayed along with him. When it was the fourth night, the mosque was filled to its utmost capacity but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come out. Some persons among then cried:" Prayer." But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come to them till he came out for the morning prayer. When he had completed the morning prayer, he turned his face to the people and recited Tashahhud (I bear testi- mony that there is no god but Allah and I bear testimony that Muhammad is His Messen- ger) and then said: Your affair was not hidden from me in the night, but I was afraid that (my observing prayer continuously) might make the night prayer obligatory for you and you might be unable to perform it.
762.01 | Zirr (b. Hubaish) reported:I heard from Ubayy b. Ka'b a statement made by 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud in which he said: He who gets up for prayer (every night) during the year will hit upon Lailat-ul-Qadr. Ubayy said: By Allah I there is no god but He, that (Lailat-ul-Qadr) is in Ramadhan (He swore without reservation: ) By Allah, I know the night; it is the night on which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to pray. It is that which precedes the morning of twenty-seventy and its indication is that the sun rises bright on that day without rays.
762.02 | Ubayy b Ka'b reported:By Allah, I know about Lailat-ul Qadr and I know it fully well that it is the twenty-seventh night (during Ramadan) on which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to observe prayer. (Shu'ba was in doubt about these words:" the night on which the Messenger of Allah [may peace be upon him] commanded us to observe the prayer." This has been transmitted to me by a friend of mine.)
762.03 | Shu'ba reported this hadith with the same chain of transmitters, but he made no mention that Shu'ba was in doubt and what follows subsequently.
763.01 | Ibn `Abbas reported:I spent a night with my maternal aunt (sister of my mother) Maimuna. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) got up during the night and relieved himself, then washed his face and hands and went to sleep. He then got up again, and came to the water skin and loosened its straps, then performed good ablution between the two extremes. He then stood up and observed prayer. I also stood up and stretched my body fearing that he might be under the impression that I was there to find out (what he did at night). So I also performed ablution and stood up to pray, but I stood on his left. He took hold of my hand and made me go around to his right side. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) completed thirteen rak`ahs of his night prayer. He then lay down and slept and snored (and it was his habit to snore while asleep). Then Bilal came and he informed him about the prayer. He (the Holy Prophet) then stood up for prayer and did not perform ablution, and his supplication included these words: "O Allah, place light in my heart, light in my sight, light in my hearing, light on my right hand, light on my left hand, light above me, light below me, light in front of me, light behind me, and enhance light for me." Kuraib (the narrator) said: There are seven (words more) which are in my heart (but I cannot recall them) and I met some of the descendants of Al-`Abbas and they narrated these words to me and mentioned in them: (Light) in my sinew, in my flesh, in my blood, in my hair, in my skin, and made a mention of two more things.
763.02 | Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn `Abbas, reported that Ibn `Abbas narrated to him that he spent a night in the house of Maimuna, the mother of the believers, who was his mother's sister. I lay down across the cushion, whereas the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his wife lay down on it length-wise. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) slept till midnight, or a little before midnight, or a little after midnight, and then got up and began to cast off the effects of sleep from his face by rubbing with his hand, and then recited the ten concluding verses of Surah Al-`Imran. He then stood up near a hanging water-skin and performed ablution well, and then stood up and prayed, Ibn `Abbas said:I also stood up and did the same, as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had done, and then went to him and stood by his side. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) placed his right hand upon my head and took hold of my right ear and twisted it, and then observed a pair of rak`ahs, again a pair of rak`ahs, again a pair of rak`ahs, again a pair of rak`ahs, again a pair of rak`ahs, again a pair of rak`ahs, and then observed Witr and then lay down till the Mu'adhdhin came to him. He (the Holy Prophet) then stood up and observed two short rak`ahs, and then went out (to the mosque) and observed the dawn prayer.
763.03 | Makhrama b. Sulaiman narrated it with the same chain of narrators and he made this addition:"He then went to the water-skin and brushed his teeth and performed ablution well. He did not pour water but a little. He then awakened me and I stood up," and the rest of the hadith is the same.
763.04 | Ibn `Abbas reported:I slept (one night) in the house of Maimuna, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was with her that night. He (after sleeping for half of the night got up and) then performed ablution and then stood up and observed prayer. I too stood on his left side. He took hold of me and made me stand on his right side. He (the Holy Prophet) observed thirteen rak`ahs on that night. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then slept and snored and it was a habit with him to snore while sleeping. The Mu'adhdhin then came to him (to inform him about the prayer). He then went out and observed prayer without performing ablution. (`Amr said: Bukair b. Ashajj had narrated it to me )
763.05 | Ibn `Abbas reported:I spent one night in the house of my mother's sister Maimuna, daughter of Al-Harith, and said to her: Awake me when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stands to pray (at night). (She woke me up when) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up for prayer. I stood on his left side. He took hold of my hand and made me stand on his right side, and whenever I dozed off he took hold of my earlobe (and made me alert). He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) observed eleven rak`ahs. He then sat with his legs drawn and wrapped in his garment and slept so that I could hear his breathing while asleep. And when the dawn appeared, he observed two short rak`ahs of (Sunnah) prayer.
763.06 | Ibn `Abbas reported that he spent a night in the house of his maternal aunt, Maimuna. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up at night and performed a short ablution (taking water) from the water-skin hanging there. (Giving a description of the ablution Ibn `Abbas said:It was short and performed with a little water.) I also got up and did the same as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had done. I then came (to him) and stood on his left. He then made me go around to his right side. He then observed prayer and went to sleep till he began to snore. Bilal came to him and informed him about the prayer. He (the Holy Prophet) then went out and observed the dawn prayer without performing ablution. Sufyan said: It was a special (prerogative of the) Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) for it has been conveyed to us that the eyes of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sleep, but his heart does not sleep.
763.07 | Ibn `Abbas said:I spent the night in the house of my mother's sister, Maimuna, and observed how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed (at night). He got up and relieved himself. He then washed his face and hands and then went to sleep. He again got up and went near the water-skin and loosened its straps and then poured some water in a bowl and inclined it with his hands (towards himself). He then performed a good ablution between the two extremes and then stood up to pray. I also came and stood by his left side. He took hold of me and made me stand on his right side. It was in thirteen rak`ahs that the (night) prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was completed. He then slept till he began to snore, and we knew that he had gone to sleep by his snoring. He then went out (for the dawn prayer), and said while praying or prostrating himself: "O Allah! place light in my heart, light in my hearing, light in my sight, light on my right, light on my left, light in front of me, light behind me, light above me, light below me, make light for me," or he said: "Make me light."
763.08 | Salama said:I met Kuraib and he reported Ibn `Abbas as saying: I was with my mother's sister Maimuna and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came there, and then he narrated the rest of the hadith as was narrated by Ghundar and said these words: "Make me light," beyond any doubt.
763.09 | Ibn `Abbas reported:I spent a night in the house of my mother's sister, Maimuna, and then narrated (the rest of the) hadith, but he made no mention of the washing of his face and two hands but he only said: He then came to the water-skin and loosened its straps and performed ablution between the two extremes, and then came to his bed and slept. He then got up for the second time and came to the water-skin and loosened its straps and then performed ablution which was in fact an ablution (it was performed well), and implored (the Lord) thus: "Give me abundant light," and he made no mention of: "Make me light."
763.10 | Kuraib reported that Ibn `Abbas spent a night in the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood near the water-skin and poured water out of it and performed ablution in which he neither used excess of water nor too little of it, and the rest of the hadith is the same, and in this mention is also made (of the fact) that on that night the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made supplication before Allah in nineteen words. Kuraib reported: I remember twelve words out of these, but have forgotten the rest. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Place light in my heart, light in my tongue, light in my hearing, light in my sight, light above me, light below me, light on my right, light on my left, light in front of me, light behind me, place light in my soul, and make light abundant for me."
763.11 | Ibn `Abbas reported:I slept one night in the house of Maimuna when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was there, with a view to seeing the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at night. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) entered into conversation with his wife for a short while, and then went to sleep, and the rest of the hadith is the same and in it mention is made of: "He then got up, performed ablution and brushed his teeth."
763.12 | `Abdullah b. `Abbas reported:He spent (one night) in the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He (the Holy Prophet) got up, brushed his teeth and performed ablution and said: "In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, there are indeed signs for people of understanding" (al-Qur'an, iii. 190), to the end of the Surah. He then stood up and prayed two rak`ahs, standing, bowing and prostrating himself at length in them. Then he finished, went to sleep and snored. He did that three times, six rak`ahs altogether, each time cleaning his teeth, performing ablution, and reciting these verses. Then he observed three rak`ahs of Witr. The Mu'adhdhin then pronounced the Adhan and he went out for prayer and was saying: "O Allah! place light in my heart, light in my tongue, place light in my hearing, place light in my eyesight, place light behind me, and light in front of me, and place light above me, and light below me. O Allah! grant me light."
763.13 | Ibn `Abbas reported:I spent a night in the house of my mother's sister Maimuna. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) got up for observing voluntary prayer (Tahajjud) at night. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) stood by the water-skin and performed ablution and then stood up and prayed. I also got up when I saw him doing that. I also performed ablution from the water-skin and then stood at his left side. He took hold of my hand from behind his back and then turned me from his back to his right side. I (`Ata', one of the narrators) said: Did it concern the voluntary prayer (at night)? He (Ibn `Abbas) said: Yes.
763.14 | Ibn `Abbas reported:(My father) Al-`Abbas sent me to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was in the house of my mother's sister Maimuna and I spent that night along with him. He (the Holy Prophet) got up and prayed at night, and I stood up on his left side. He caught hold of me from behind his back and made me stand on his right side.
763.15 | Ibn `Abbas reported:I spent a night in the house of my mother's sister Maimuna, and the rest of the hadith is the same as narrated above.
764 | Abu Jamra reported:I heard Ibn 'Abbas saying that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed thirteen rak'ahs at night.
765 | Zaid b Khalid al-Juhani said:I would definitely watch at night the prayer observed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He prayed two short rak'ahs, then two long, long, long rak'ahs, then he prayed two rak'ahs which were shorter than the two preceding rak'ahs, then he prayed two rak'ahs which were shorter than the two preceding, then he prayed two rak'ahs which were shorter than the two preceding, then observed a single one (Witr), making a total of thirteen rak'ahs
766 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a journey and we reached a watering place. He said: Jabir, are you going to enter it? I said: Yes. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then got down and I entered it. He (the Holy Prophet) then went away to relieve himself and I placed for him water for ablution. He then came back and performed ablution, and then stood and prayed in one garment, having its ends tied from the opposite sides. I stood behind him and he caught hold of my ear and made me stand on his right side.
767 | 'A'isha reported that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up at night to pray, he began his prayer with two short rak'ahs.
768 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying When any one of you gets up at night, he should begin the prayer with two short rak'ahs.
769.01 | Ibn `Abbas reported that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up during the night to pray, he used to say:O Allah, to Thee be the praise Thou art the light of the heavens and the earth. To Thee be the praise; Thou art the Supporter of the heavens and the earth. To Thee be the praise; Thou art the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is therein. Thou art the Truth; Thy promise is True, the meeting with Thee is True. Paradise is true, Hell is true, the Hour is true. O Allah, I submit to Thee; affirm my faith in Thee; repose my trust in Thee, and I return to Thee for repentance; by Thy help I have disputed; and to Thee I have come for decision, so forgive me my earlier and later sins, the sins that I committed in secret and openly. Thou art my God. There is no god but Thee.
769.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas through another chain of transmitters and with slight alteration of two words. Instead of the word Qayyam (Supporter, as used in the above hadith here the word) Qayyim (the Custodian) has been used, and he (further said):" What I did in secret." And in the hadith narrated by Ibn 'Uyaina there is some addition.
769.03 | This hadith has been narrated by Ibn 'Abbas by another chain of transmitters and the words are nearly the same (as recorded in the above-mentioned hadith).
770 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf reported:I asked 'A'isha, the mother of the believers, (to tell me) the words with which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commenced the prayer when he got up at night. She said: When he got up at night he would commence his prayer with these words: O Allah, Lord of Gabriel, and Michael, and Israfil, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Who knowest the unseen and the seen; Thou decidest amongst Thy servants concerning their differences. Guide me with Thy permission in the divergent views (which the people) hold about Truth, for it is Thou Who guidest whom Thou wilt to the Straight Path.
771.01 | 'Ali b. Abu Talib reported that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up at night for prayer he would say:I turn my face in complete devotion to One Who is the Originator of the heaven and the earth and I am not of the polytheists. Verily my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the worlds; There is no partner with Him and this is what I have been commanded (to profess and believe) and I am of the believers. O Allah, Thou art the King, there is no god but Thee, Thou art my Lord, and I am Thy bondman. I wronged myself and make a confession of my Sin. Forgive all my sins, for no one forgives the sins but Thee, and guide me in the best of conduct for none but Thee guideth anyone (in) good conduct. Remove sins from me, for none else but Thou can remove sins from me. Here I am at Thy service, and Grace is to Thee and the whole of good is in Thine hand, and one cannot get nearneststo Thee through evil. My (power as well as existence) is due to Thee (Thine grace) and I turn to Thee (for supplication). Thou art blessed and Thou art exalted. I seek forgiveness from Thee and turn to Thee in repentance: and when he would bow, he would say: O Allah, it is for Thee that I bowed. I affirm my faith in Thee and I submit to Thee, and submit humbly before Thee my hearing, my eyesight, my marrow, my bone, my sinew; and when he would raise his head, he would say: O Allah, our Lord, praise is due to Thee, (the praise) with which is filled the heavens and the earth, and with which is filled that (space) which exists between them, and filled with anything that Thou desireth afterward. And when he prostrated himself, he (the Holy Prophet) would say: O Allah, it is to Thee that I prostrate myself and it is in Thee that I affirm my faith, and I submit to Thee. My face is submitted before One Who created it, and shaped it, and opened his faculties of hearing and seeing. Blessed is Allah, the best of Creators; and he would then say between Tashahhud and the pronouncing of salutation: Forgive me of the earlier and later open and secret (sins) and that where I made transgression and that Thou knowest better than I. Thou art the First and the Last. There is no god, but Thee.
771.02 | A'raj reported that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would start the prayer, he would pronounce takbir (Allah-o-Akbar) and then say:I turn my face (up to Thee), I am the first of the believers; and when he raised his head from ruku' he said: Allah listened to him who praised Him; O our Lord, praise be to Thee; and he said: He shaped (man) and how fine is his shape? And he (the narrator) said: When he pronounced salutation he said: O Allah, forgive me my earlier (sins), to the end of the hadith; and he did not say it between the Tashahhud and salutation (as mentioned above).
772 | Hudhaifa reported:I prayed with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one night and he started reciting al-Baqara. I thought that he would bow at the end of one hundred verses, but he proceeded on; I then thought that he would perhaps recite the whole (surah) in a rak'ah, but he proceeded and I thought he would perhaps bow on completing (this surah). He then started al-Nisa', and recited it; he then started Al-i-'Imran and recited leisurely. And when he recited the verses which referred to the Glory of Allah, he glorified (by saying Subhan Allah-Glory to my Lord the Great), and when he recited the verses which tell (how the Lord) is to be begged, he (the Holy Prophet) would then beg (from Him), and when he recited the verses dealing with protection from the Lord, he sought (His) protection and would then bow and say: Glory be to my Mighty Lord; his bowing lasted about the same length of time as his standing (and then on returning to the standing posture after ruku') he would say: Allah listened to him who praised Him, and he would then stand about the same length of time as he had spent in bowing. He would then prostrate himself and say: Glory be to my Lord most High, and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing. In the hadith transmitted by Jarir the words are:" He (the Holy Prophet) would say:" Allah listened to him who praised Him, our Lord, to Thee i the praise."
773.01 | 'Abdullah reported:I prayed with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he lengthened it till I entertained an evil thought. It was said to him what that thought was. He said: I thought that I should sit down and forsake him.
773.02 | A hadith like this has been narrated by A'mash with the same chain of transmitters.

775 | Husain b. 'Ali narrated on the authority of (his father) 'Ali b. Abu Talib that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came one night to see him ('Ali) and Fatimah (the daughter of the Holy Prophet) and said:Don't you observe (Tahajjud) prayer? I ('Ali) said: Messenger of Allah, verily our souls are in the hands of Allah and when He wants to awaken us, He awakens us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went back when I said this to him. He was striking his hand on his thigh while returning, and I heard him say: Verily the man disputes with many things.
776 | Abu Huraira transmitted it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ):When any one of you goes to sleep, the devil ties three knots at the back of his neck, sealing every knot with:" You have a long night, so sleep." So if one awakes and mentions Allah, a knot will be loosened; if he performs ablution two knots are loosened; and if he prays (all) knots will be loosened, and in the morning he will be active and in good spirits; otherwise we will be in bad spirits and sluggish in the morning.

And when he did not come out, they cried aloud and threw pebbles at the door. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out in anger and said to them: By what you have been constantly doing, I was inclined to think that it (prayer) might not become obligatory for you.

Thabit reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made an apartment in the mosque of mats, and he observed in it prayers for many nights till people began to gather around him, and the rest of the hadith is the same but with this addition:" Had this (Nafl) prayer become obligatory for you, you would not be able to observe it."

By Allah, Allah would not grow weary, but you will grow weary.
785.02 | 'A'isha said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to me when a woman was sitting with me. He said: Who is she? I said: She is a woman who does not sleep but prays. He said: Do such acts which you are capable of doing. By Allah, Allah does not grow weary but you will grow weary.

(He should instead of using this expression say): I have been made to forget it. Try to remember the Qur'an for it is more apt to escape from men's minds than a hobbled camel.

My people would not be able to do it. He then came to him for the fourth time and said: Allah has commanded you to recite the Qur'an to your people in seven dialects, and in whichever dialect they would recite, they would be right.
821.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters.
822.01 | Abu Wa'il reported that a person named Nabik b. Sinan came to Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) and said:Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, how do you recite this word (alif) or (ya)? Would you read It as: min ma'in ghaira asin or au min ma'in ghaira ghaira yasin. (al-Qur'an, xlvii. 15)? 'Abdullah said: You (seem to) have memorised the whole of the Qur'an except this. He (again) said: I recite all the mufassal surahs in one rak'ah. Upon this 'Abdullah said: (You must have been reciting It) hastily like the recitation of poetry. Verily. there are people who recite the Qur'an, but it does not go down beyond their collar bones. It is (a fact with the Qur'an) that it is beneficial only when it settles in the heart and is rooted deeply in it. The best of (the acts) in prayer are bowing and prostration. I am quite aware of the occasions when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) combined together two surahs in every rak'ah. 'Abdullah then stood up and went out with 'Alqama following in his footstep. He said Ibn Numair had told him that the narration was like that:" A person belonging to Banu Bajila came to 'Abdullah," and he did not mention (the name of) Nahik b. Sinan.
822.02 | Abu Wa'il reported:A person came to 'Abdullah, who was called Nahik b. Sinan, and the rest of the hadith is the same but for this:" Alqama came to him ('Abdullah b. Mas'ud) and we said to him: Ask him about the manners in which he combined (two surahs) in one rak'ah. So he went to him and asked him and then came to us and said: Twenty are the mufassal surahs in the compilation (of the Qur'an) made by 'Abdullah."
822.03 | This hadith has been narrated by A'mash with the same chain of transmitters in which ('Abdullah b. Mas'ud) said:" I know the manners in which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited the two surahs in one rak'ah and then twenty surahs in ten rak'ahs."
822.04 | Abu Wa'il reported:One day we went to 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud after we had observed the dawn prayer and we paid salutation at the door. He permitted us to enter, but we stayed for a while at the door, when the slave-girl came out and said: Why don't you come in? So we went in and (we found 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud) sitting and glorifying Allah (i. e. he was busy in dhikr) and he said: What obstructed you from coming in though you had been granted permission for it? We said: There was nothing (behind it) but we entertained the idea that some inmate of the house might be sleeping. He said: Do you presume any idleness on the part of the family of Ibn Umm 'Abd (the mother of Abdullah b. Mas'ud)? He was again busy with the glorification of Allah till he thought that the sun had risen. He said: Girl, see whether (the sun) has arisen. She glanced but it had not risen (by that time). He was again busy with the glorification (of Allah) and he (again) thought that the sun had arisen. She glanced (and confirmed) that, it had risen. Upon this he ('Abdullah b. Mas'ud) said: Praise be to Allah Who did not call us to account for our sins today. Mahdi said: I think that he said, He did not destroy us for our sins. One among the people said: I recited all the mufassal surahs during the night. 'Abdullah said: (You must have recited them) like the (recitation) of poetry. I heard (the Holy Prophet) combining (the sarahs) and I remember the combinations which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made In the recitation (of surahs). These were constituted of eighteen mufassal surahs and two surahs (commencing with) Ha-Mim.
822.05 | Shaqiq reported:A person from Banu Bajila who was called Nabik b. Sinan came to Abdullah and said: I recite mufassal surahs in one rak'ah. Upon this 'Abdullah said: (You recite) like the recitation of poetry. I know the manner in which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited two surahs in one rak'ah.
822.06 | Abu Wa'il reported:A person came to 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud and said: I recited all the mufassal surahs in one rak'ah during the night. 'Abdullah said: You must have recited hastily like the recitation of poetry. 'Abdullah said: I remember well the manner in which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to combine them, and he then mentioned twenty of the mufassal surahs, and (their combinations in) two in every rak'ah.
823.01 | Abu Ishaq reported:I saw a man asking Aswad b. Yazid who taught the Qur'an in the mosque: How do you recite the verse (fahal min muddakir) whether (the word muddakir) Is with (d) or (dh)? He (Aswad) said: It was with (d). I heard Abdullah b. Mas'ud saying that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) reciting (muddakir) with (d).
823.02 | Ishaq is reported to have said on the authority of Aswad who quoted on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite these words as (fahal min muddakir).
824.01 | 'Alqama reported. We went to Syria and Abu Darda' came to us and said:Is there anyone among you who recites according to the recitation of Abdullah? I said: Yes, it is I. He again said: How did you hear 'Abdullah reciting this verse: (wa'l-lail-i-idha yaghsha = when the night covers)? He ('Alqama) said: I heard him reciting it (like this) (wa'l-lail-i-idha yaghsha) wa-dhakar wal untha = when the night covers and the males and the females). Upon this he said: By Allah, I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) reciting in this way, but they (the Muslims of Syria) desire us to recite: (wa ma khalaqa), but I do not yield to their desire.
824.02 | Ibrahim reported:'Alqama came to Syria and entered the mosque and prayed there and then went to a (place where people were sitting in a) circle and he sat therein. Then a person came there and I perceived that the people were annoyed and perturbed (on this arrival). and he sat on my side and then said: Do you remember how 'Abdullah used to recite (the Qur'an)? And then the rest of the hadith was narrated.
824.03 | 'Alqama reported:I met Abu Darda', and he said to me: To which country do you belong? I said: I am one of the people of Iraq. He again said: To which city? I replied: City of Kufa. He again said: Do you recite according to the recitation of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud? I said: Yes. He said: Recite this verse (By the night when it covers) So I recited it: (By the night when it covers, and the day when it shines, and the creating of the male and the female). He laughed and said: I have heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) reciting like this.
824.04 | This hadith has been narrated by another chain of transmitters.
825 | Abu Huraira is reported to have said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited to observe prayer after the 'Asr prayer till the sun is set, and after the dawn till the sun rises.
826.01 | Ibn 'Abbas reported:I heard it from so many Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and one among them is 'Umar b. Khattab, and he is most dear to me among them that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited observing of prayer after the dawn prayer till the sun rose and after the 'Asr till the sun set.
826.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Qatada with the same chain of transmitters with a minor alteration of words.

828.01 | Ibn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Let not any one of you intend to observe prayer at the time of the rising of the sun or of the setting sun.
828.02 | Ibn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Do not intend to observe prayer at the time of the rising of the sun nor at its setting, for it rises between the horns of Satan.
829 | Ibn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:When the rim of the sun starts appearing defer prayer till it completely appears, and when the rim of the sun disappears defer prayer till it completely disappears.
830.01 | Abu Basra Ghifari reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in the 'Asr prayer at (the place known as) Mukhammas, and then said: This prayer was presented to those gone before you, but they lost it, and he who guards it has two rewards in store for him. And no prayer is valid after till the onlooker appears (by onlooker is meant the evening star).
830.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Abu Basra Ghifari through another chain of transmitters.
831 | Uqba b. 'Amir said:There were three times at which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade us to pray, or bury our dead: When the sun begins to rise till it is fully up, when the sun is at its height at midday till it passes over the meridian, and when the sun draws near to setting till it sets.
832 | 'Amr b. 'Abasa Sulami reported:In the state of the Ignorance (before embracing Islam), I used to think that the people were in error and they were not on anything (which may be called the right path) and worshipped the idols. Meanwhile, I heard of a man in Mecca who was giving news (on the basis of his prophetic knowledge) ; so I sat on my ride and went to him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was at that time hiding as his people had made life hard for him. I adopted a friendly attitude (towards the Meccans and thus managed) to enter Mecca and go to him (the Holy Prophet) and I said to him: Who are you? He said: I am a Prophet (of Allah). I again said: Who is a Prophet? He said: (I am a Prophet in the sense that) I have been sent by Allah. I said: What is that which you have been sent with? He said: I have been sent to join ties of relationship (with kindness and affection), to break the Idols, and to proclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that) nothing is to be associated with Him. I said: Who is with you in this (in these beliefs and practices)? He said: A free man and a slave. He (the narrator) said: Abu Bakr and Bilal were there with him among those who had embraced Islam by that time. I said: I intend to follow you. He said: During these days you would not be able to do so. Don't you see the (hard) condition under which I and (my) people are living? You better go back to your people and when you hear that I have been granted victory, you come to me. So I went to my family. I was in my home when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to Medina. I was among my people and used to seek news and ask people when he arrived in Medina. Then a group of people belonging to Yathrib (Medina) came. I said (to them): How is that person getting on who has come to Medina? They said: The people are hastening to him, while his people (the polytheists of Mecca) planned to kill him, but they could not do so. I (on hearing it) came to Medina and went to him and said: Messenger of Allah, do you recognise me? He said: Yes, you are the same man who met me at Mecca. I said: It is so. I again said: Prophet of Allah, tell me that which Allah has taught you and which I do not know, tell me about the prayer. He said: Observe the dawn prayer, then stop praying when the sun is rising till it is fully up, for when it rises it comes up between the horns of Satan, and the unbelievers prostrate themselves to it at that time. Then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended (by angels) till the shadow becomes about the length of a lance; then cease prayer, for at that time Hell is heated up. Then when the shadow moves forward, pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended by angels, till you pray the afternoon prayer, then cease prayer till the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of devil, and at that time the unbelievers prostrate themselves before it. I said: Apostle of Allah, tell me about ablution also. He said: None of you who uses water for ablution and rinses his mouth, snuffs up water and blows it, but the sins of his face, and his mouth and his nostrils fall out. When he washes his face, as Allah has commanded him, the sins of his face fall out from the end of his beard with water. Then (when) he washes his forearms up to the elbows, the sins of his arms fall out along with water from his finger-tips. And when he wipes his head, the sins of his head fall out from the points of his hair along with water. And (when) he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins of his feet fall out from his toes along with water. And if he stands to pray and praises Allah, lauds Him and glorifies Him with what becomes Him and shows wholehearted devotion to Allah, his sins would depart leaving him (as innocent) as he was on the day his mother bore him. 'Amr b. 'Abasa narrated this hadith to Abu Umama, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and Abu Umama said to him: 'Amr b. 'Abasa, think what you are saying that such (a great reward) is given to a man at one place (only in the act of ablution and prayer). Upon this 'Amr said: Abu Umama, I have grown old and my bones have become weak and I am at the door of death; what impetus is there for me to attribute a lie to Allah and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? Had I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) once, twice, or three times (even seven times), I would have never narrated it, but I have heard it from him on occasions more than these.
833.01 | 'A'isha reported that 'Umar misconstrued the fact that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had prohibited the observance of prayer at the time of the rising sun and at the time of its setting.
833.02 | 'A'isha said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not abandon observing two rak'ahs after 'Asr, but she reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Do not get used to observe prayer at the time of the rising sun and at the time of its setting and (exhorted the Muslims) to pray at their times.
834 | Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas, reported that 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas, 'Abd al-Rahman b. Azhar, al-Miswar b. Makhrama sent him to 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), telling him to give her their greetings, and ask her about the two rak'ahs after the afternoon prayer, (for)" we have heard that you observe them whereas it has been conveyed to us that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited their observance." Ibn 'Abbas said:I along with 'Umar b. al-Khattab dissuaded people to do so (to observe two rak'ahs of prayer). Kuraib said: I went to her ('A'isha) and conveyed to her the message with which I was sent. She said: (Better) ask Umm Salama. So I went to them (those who had sent him to Hadrat 'A'isha) and informed them about what she had said. They sent me back to Umm Salama with that with which I was sent to 'A'isha. Umm Salama said: I beard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibiting them, and then afterwards I saw him observing them. And when he observed them (two rak'ahs) he had already observed the 'Asr prayer. Then he (the Holy Prophet) came, while there were with me ladies of Banu Haram, a tribe of the Ansar and he (the Holy Prophet) observed them (the two rak'ahs). I sent a slave-girl to him asking her to stand by his side and say to him that Umm Salama says: Messenger of Allah, I heard you prohibiting these two rak'ahs, whereas I saw you observing them; and if he (the Holy Prophet) points with his hand (to wait), then do wait. The slave-girl did like that. He (the Holy Prophet) pointed out with his hand and she got aside and waited, and when he had finished (the prayer) he said: Daughter of Abu Umayya. you have asked about the two rak'ahs after the 'Asr prayer. Some people of 'Abu al-Qais came to me for embracing Islam and hindered me from observing the two rak'ahs which come after the noon prayer. So those are the two I have been praying.
835.01 | Abu Salama asked 'A'isha about the two prostrations (i. e. rak'ahs) which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made after the 'Asr. She said:He (the Holy Prophet) observed them before the 'Asr prayer, but then he was hindered to do so, or he forgot them and then he observed them after the 'Asr, and then he continued observing them. (It was his habit) that when he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer, he then continued observing it. Isma'il said: It implies that he always did that.
835.02 | 'A'isha reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not abandon at all observing two rak'ahs after the 'Asr in my house.
835.03 | 'A'isha reported:Two are the prayers which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) always observed in my house-openly or secretly-two rak'ahs before the dawn and two rak'ahs after the 'Asr.
835.04 | Aswad and Masruq reported:We bear testimony to the fact that 'A'isha said: Never was there a day that he (the Holy Prophet) was with me and he did not observe two rak'ahs of prayer in my house, i. e. two rak'ahs after the Asr.
836 | Mukhtar b. Fulful said:I asked Anas b. Malik about the voluntary prayers after the afternoon prayer, and he replied: 'Umar struck hit hands on prayer observed after the 'Asr prayer and we used to observe two rak'ahs after the sun set before the evening prayer during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I said to him: Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observe them? He said: He saw us observing them, but he neither commanded us nor forbade us to do so.
837 | Anas b. Malik reported:When we were in Medina, the moment the Mu'adhdhin made the call to the sunset prayer, the people hastened to the pillars of the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs with the result that any stranger coming into the mosque would think that the obligatory prayer had been observed owing to the number who were praying then.
838.01 | Abdullah b. Mughaffal reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) u saying:There Is between the two calls (Adhan and Iqama) a prayer. And he mentioned it three times, and at the third time he said: This applies to those who wish to do it.
838.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Abdullah b. Mughaffal by another chain of transmitters, but with this variation that he (the Holy Prophet) said at the fourth time:" He who wishes (may do to)."
839.01 | Salim b. Abdullah b. 'Umar reported:The Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) led on* of the two groups In one rak'ah of prayer in danger, while the other group faced the -enemy. Then they (the members of the first group) went back and replaced their companions who were facing the enemy. and then they (the members of the second group) came and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led them in one rak'ah of prayer. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pronounced salutation, and then they (the members of the Ant group) completed the rak'ah and they (the members of the second group) completed the rak'ah.
839.02 | This hadith has been narrated by another chain of transmitters.
839.03 | Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed prayer in danger on some day (in this way):a group stood with him (the Holy Prophet) (for prayer) and the other group stood In front of the enemy. Then those who were with (him) observed one rak'ah of prayer and they went back and the others came and they observed one rak'ah (with him). Then both the groups completed one rak'ah each. Ibn Umar said: When there is greater danger, then observe prayer even on the ride or with the help of gestures in a standing posture.
840.01 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:I observed prayer in danger with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We drew ourselves up in two rows, one row behind him with the enemy between us and the Qibla. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah is Most Great, and we all said it. He then bowed and we all bowed. He then raised his head from bowing, we all raised (our heads). He then went down in prostration along with the row close to him, and the rear row faced the enemy; then when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) completed the prostration, ; and then stood up, the row near to him also did it; then went down the rear row in prostration; then they stood up; then the rear row went to the front and the front row went to the rear. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) bowed down and we all bowed. He then raised his head from bowing and we also raised (our heads). He and the row close to him which I had been in the rear then went down in prostration In the first rak'ah, whereas the rear row faced the enemy. And when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the rear row close to him had finished the prostration, the rear row went down and prostrated themselves; then the Messenger of Allah pronounced the salutation and we also pronounced the salutation. (Jabir said we hadith) as your guards behave with their chiefs.
840.02 | Jabir reported:We fought In the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with the tribe of Juhaina. They fought with us terribly. When we had finished the noon prayer, the polytheists said: Had we attacked them at once. we would have killed them. Gabriel informed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about It (about their evil design). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a mention of it to us, adding that they (the polytheists) had also said: Shortly there would be time for the 'Asr prayer. which is dearer o them (the Muslims) than even their children. So when the time of the 'Asr prayer came. we formed ourselves into two rows, while the polytheists were between us and the Qibla. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah is Most Great, and we also said so. He bowed and we also bowed. He went down in prostration and the first row prostrated along with him. When they stood up, the second row went down in prostration. Then the first row went into the rear, and the second row came in the front and occupied the place of the first row. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: Allah is Most Great, and we also said so. He then bowed, and we also bowed. He then went down in prostration and along with him the row also (went down in prostration), and the second row remained standing. And when the second row had also prostrated and all of them sat down then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pronounced salutation to them. Abu Zubair said: Jabir made a mention specially of this thing: just as your chiefs observe prayer.
841 | Sahl b. Abu Hathma reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led his Companions in prayer in danger. He made them stand in two rows behind him. He led them who were close to him in one rak'ah. He then stood up and kept standing till those who were behind them observed one rak'ah. Then they (those standing in the second row) came in front and those who were in front went into the rear. He then led them In one rak'ah. He then sat down, till those who were behind him observed one rak'ah and then pronounced salutation.
842 | Yazid b. Ruman told on the authority of Salih b. Khawwat on the authority of one who prayed in time of danger with Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) at the Battle of Dhat ar-Riqa' that a group formed a row and prayed along with him, and a group faced the enemy. He led the group which was along with him in a rak'ah, then remained standing while they finished the prayer by themselves. Then they departed and formed a row facing the enemy. Then the second group came and he led them in the remaining rak'ah, after which he remained seated while they finished the prayer themselves. He then led them in salutation.
843.01 | Jabir reported:We went forward with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and when we reached Dhat ar-Riqa', we came to a shady tree which -we left for him One of the polytheists came there and, seeing the sword of the Messenger (ﷺ) hanging by a free. took it up. drew it from the scabbard and said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): Are you afraid of Me? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No. He again said: Who would protect you from me? He said: Allah will protect me from you. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) threatened him. He sheathed the sword and hung it up. Then call to prayer was made and he (the Holy Prophet) led a group in two rak'ah. Then (the members of this group) withdrew and he led the second group in two rak'ah. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed four rak'ah and people observed two rak'ah.
843.02 | Abu Salama b. 'Abd al-Rahman reported that Jabir told him that he had observed the prayer in danger with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (first) led one of the two groups in two rak'ah of prayer. and then led the second group in two rak'ah of prayer.

You know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded (us) to take a bath (on Friday).
845.02 | Abu Huraira reported:Umar b. Khattab was delivering a sermon to the people on Friday when 'Uthman b. 'Affan came there.

853 | Abu Burda b. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari reported:'Abdullah b. Umar said to me: Did you hear anything from your father narrating something from the messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the time on Friday? I said: Yes, I heard him say from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (these words):" It is between the time when the Imam sits down and the end of the prayer."

And it was this day of theirs about which they disagreed, but Allah guided us to it, and that is Friday for us; the next day is for the Jews and the day following for the Christians.
855.04 | Abu Huraira reported Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), as saying:We who are the last would be the first on the Day of Resurrection but they (other Ummahs) were given the Book before us and we were given after them, and this was the day that was prescribed for them but they disagreed on it.

856.01 | It is narrated by Abu Huraira and Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:It was Friday from which Allah diverted those who were before us. For the Jews (the day set aside for prayer) was Sabt (Saturday), and for the Christians it was Sunday. And Allah turned towards us and guided us to Friday (as the day of prayer) for us. In fact, He (Allah) made Friday, Saturday and Sunday (as days of prayer). In this order would they (Jews and Christians) come after us on the Day of Resurrection.

And he who comes early is like one who offers a she-camel as a sacrifice, the next like one who offers a cow, the next a ram, the next a hen, the next an egg.

And when the Imam sits (on the pulpit) the sheets are folded and they (the angels) attend to the mention of Allah.
857.01 | Abu-Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:He who took a bath and then came for Jumu'a prayer and then prayed what was fixed for him, then kept silence till the Imam finished the sermon, and then prayed along with him, his sins between that time and the next Friday would be forgiven, and even of three days more.

He would also say: "The Last Hour and I have been sent like these two." And he would join his forefinger and middle finger; and would further say: "The best of the speech is embodied in the Book of Allah, and the best of the guidance is the guidance given by Muhammad. And the most evil affairs are their innovations; and every innovation is error." He would further say:, I am more dear to a Muslim even than his self; and he who left behind property that is for his family; and he who dies under debt or leaves children (in helplessness), the responsibility (of paying his debt and bringing up his children) lies on me."
867.02 | Ja'far b. Muhammad said on the authority of his father:I heard Jabir b. 'Abdullah saying that in the sermon of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) he praised Allah, lauded Him (and subsequently said [other words] and raised his voice, and the rest of the hadith is the same).

He heard the foolish people of Mecca say that Muhammad (ﷺ) was under the spell. Upon this he said: If 1 were to come across this man, Allah might cure him at my hand. He met him and said: Muhammad, I can protect (one) who is under the influence of charm, and Allah cures one whom He so desires at my hand. Do you desire (this)? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Praise is due to Allah, we praise Him, ask His help; and he whom Allah guides aright there is none to lead him astray, and he who is led astray there is none to guide him, and I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah, He is One, having no partner with Him, and that Muhammad is His Servant and Messenger. Now after this he (Dimad) said: Repeat these words of yours before me, and the messenger of Allah (ﷺ) repeated these to him thrice; and he said I have heard the words of soothsayers and the words of magicians, and the words of poets, but I have never heard such words as yours, and they reach the depth (of the ocean of eloquence) ; bring forth your hand so that I should take oath of fealty to you on Islam. So he took an oath of allegiance to him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: It (this allegiance of yours) is on behalf of your people too. He said: It is on behalf of my people too. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent an expedition and the flying column passed by his people. The leader of the flying column said to the detachment: Did you find anything from these people?

When he (, Ammir) descended (from the pulpit) we said to him: 0 Abd al-Yaqzn, you have delivered a short and eloquent sermon. Would that you had lengthened (the sermon). He said: I have heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: The lengthening of prayer by a man and the shortness of the sermon is the sign of his understanding (of faith). So lengthen the prayer and shorten the sermon, for there is charm (in precise) expression.
870 | 'Adi b. Hatim reported:that a person recited a sermon before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) thus: He who obeys Allah and His Apostle, he in fact follows the right path, and he who disobeys both of them, he goes astray.

He then made his way through their (assembly) till he came to the women. Bilal was with him. He then recited (this verse): O Prophet, when believing women come to thee giving thee a pledge that they will not associate aught with Allah" (lx. 12) till he finished (his address to) them and then said: Do you conform to it (what has been described in the verse)? Only one woman among them replied: Yes, Apostle of Allah, but none else replied. He (the narrator) said: It could not be ascertained who actually she was.

Bilal had stretched his cloth in which women were throwing alms. I (one of the narrators) said to 'Ata' (the other narrator): It must be Zakat on the day of Fitr. He ('Ata') said: No. It was alms (which) they were giving on that occasion, and a woman gave her ring, and then others gave, and then others gave. I said to 'Ata': Is It right now for the Imam to come to the women when he has finished (his address to the men) that he should exhort them (to good deeds)? He said: (Why not) by my life, it is right for them (to do so). What is the matter with them that they do not do it now?

He then walked on till he came to the women and preached to them and admonished them, and asked them to give alms, for most of them are the fuel for Hell. A woman having a dark spot on the cheek stood up and said: Why is it so, Messenger of Allah? He said: For you grumble often and show ingratitude to your spouse.

And after having observed his prayer and pronounced the salutation, he stood up facing people as they were seated at their places of worship. And if he intended to send out an army he made mention of it to the people, and if he intended any other thing besides it, he commanded them (to do that). He used to say (to the people):Give alms, give alms, give alms, and the majority that gave alms was of women. He then returned and this (practice) remained (in vogue) till Marwan b. al- Hakam (came into power). I went out hand in hand with Marwan till we came to the place of worship and there Kathir b. Salt had built a pulpit of clay and brick. Marwan began to tug me with his hand as though he were pulling me towards the pulpit, while I was pulling him towards the prayer. When I saw him doing that I said: What has happened to the practice of beginning with prayer? He said: No, Abu Sa'id, what you are familiar with has been abandoned. I thereupon said (three times and went back): By no means, by Him in Whose hand my life is, you are not doing anything better than what I am familiar with.

He said:He used to recite in them:" Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an" (Surah 1)," The Hour drew near, and the moon was rent asunder" (Surah liv.).
891.02 | 'Utba reported that his father Waqid al-Laithi said:'Umar b. Khattab asked me what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited on 'Id day. I said:" The Hour drew near" and Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an".
892.01 | 'A'isha reported:Abu Bakr came to see me and I had two girls with me from among the girls of the Ansar and they were singing what the Ansar recited to one another at the Battle of Bu'ath. They were not, however, singing girls. Upon this Abu Bakr said: What I (the playing of) this wind instrument of Satan in the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and this too on 'Id day? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Abu Bakr, every people have a festival and it is our festival (so let them play on).
892.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Hisham with the same chain of transmitters, but there the words are:" Two girls were playing upon a tambourine."
892.03 | 'A'isha reported that Abu Bakr came to her and there were with her two girls on Adha days who were singing and beating the tambourine and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had wrapped himself with his mantle. Abu Bakr scolded them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) uncovered (his face) and said:Abu Bakr, leave them alone for these are the days of 'Id. And 'A'isha said: I recapitulate to my mind the fact that once the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) screened me with his mantle and I saw the sports of the Abyssinians, and I was only a girl, and so you can well imagine how a girl of tender age is fond of watching the sport.
892.04 | 'A'isha reported:BY Allah, I remember the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) standing on the door of my apartment screening me with his mantle enabling me to see the sport of the Abyssinians as they played with their daggers in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upom him). He (the Holy Prophet) kept standing for my sake till I was satiated and then I went back; and thus you can well imagine how long a girl tender of age who is fond of sports (could have watched it).
892.05 | `A'isha reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came (to my apartment) while there were two girls with me singing the song of the Battle of Bu`ath. He lay down on the bed and turned away his face. Then came Abu Bakr and he scolded me and said: Oh! this musical instrument of the devil in the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned towards him and said: Leave them alone. And when he (the Holy Prophet) became unattentive, I hinted them and they went out, and it was the day of `Id and the black men were playing with shields and spears. (I do not remember) whether I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) or whether he said to me if I desired to see (that sport). I said: Yes. I stood behind him with his face parallel to my face, and he said: O Banu Arfada, be busy (in your sports) till I was satiated. He said (to me): Is that enough? I said: Yes. Upon this he asked me to go.
892.06 | 'A'isha reported that some Abyssinians came and gave a demonstration of armed fight on the 'Id day in the mosque. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) invited me (to see that fight). I placed my head on his shoulder and began to see their sport till it was I who turned away from watching them.
892.07 | This hadith has been narrated by Hisham with the same chain of transmitters but (the narrators) did not make mention of the mosque.
892.08 | 'A'isha said that she sent a message to the players (of this armed fight) saying:I like to see them (fighting). She further said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and I stood at the door (behind him) and saw (this fight) between his ears and his shoulders they played in the mosque. 'Ata' (one of the narra- tors) said: Were they persians or Abyssinians? Ibn 'Atiq told me they were Abyssinians.
893 | Abu Huraira reported:While the Abyssinians were busy playing with their arms in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) 'Umar b. Khattab came there. He bent down to take up pebbles to throw at them (in order to make them go off). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: 'Umar, leave them alone.
894.01 | 'Abdullah b. Zaid b. Mazini reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went to the place of prayer and prayed for rain and turned round his mantle while facing the Qibla.
894.02 | Ibn Tamim narrated on the authority of his uncle ('Abdullah b. Zaid) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to the place of prayer and prayed for rain and faced towards Qibla, and turned round his mantle and prayed two rak'ahs.
894.03 | 'Abdullah b. Zaid al-Ansari reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to the place of prayer in order to offer prayer for rainfall. And when he intended to make supplication he faced Qibla and turned round his mantle.
894.04 | 'Abbad b. Tamim Mazini heard his uncle, who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), as saying:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out one day in order to pray for rain. He turned his back towards people, supplicated before Allah, facing towards Qibla, and turned his mantle round and then observed two rak'ahs of prayer.
895.01 | Anas reported:I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raising his hands (high enough) in supplication (for rain) that the whiteness of his armpits became visible.
895.02 | Anas b. Malik reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for rain pointing the back of his hands to the sky.
895.03 | Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was not accustomed to raice his hands in any supplication he made except when praying for rain. (He would then raise [his hands] high enough) that the whiteness of his armpits became visible. 'Abd al-A'la said that (he was in doubt whether it was) the whiteness of his armpit or armpits.
896 | This hadith has been narrated by Anas b. Malik through another chain of transmitters.
897.01 | Anas b. Malik reported that a person entered the mosque through the door situated on theside of Daral-Qada' during Friday (prayer) and the messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was delivering the sermon while standing. He came and stood in front of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said:Messenger of Allah, the camels died and the passages were blocked; so supplicate Allah to send down rain upon us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his hands and then said: (O Allah, send down rain upon us; O Allah, send dowp rain upon us; O Allah, send down rain upon us. Anas said: By Allah, we did not see any cloud or any patch of it, and there was neither any house or building standing between us and the (hillock) Sal'a. There appeared a cloud in the shape of a shield from behind it, and as it (came high) in the sky it spread and then there was a downpour of rain. By Allah, we did not see the sun throughout the week. Then (that very man) came on the coming Friday through the same door when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was standing and delivering the sermon. He stood in front of him and said: Messenger of Allah, our animals died and the passages blocked. Supplicate Allah to stop the rain for us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) again raised his hands and said: O Allah, let it (rain) fall in our suburbs and not on us, O Allah (send it down) on the hillocks and small mountains and the river-beds and at places where trees grow. The rain stopped, and as we stepped out we were walking in sun- shine. He (the narrator) said to Sharik: I asked Anas b. Malik if he was the same man. He said: I do not know.
897.02 | Anas b. Malik reported:The people were in the grip of famine during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and (once) as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was delivering the sermon standing on the pulpit on Friday, a bedouin stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, the animals died and the children suffered starvation. The rest of the hadith is the same (and the words are) that he (the Holy Prophet) said: O Allah, send down rain in our suburbs but not on us. He (the narrator) said: To whichever directions he pointed with his hands, the clouds broke up and I saw Medina like the opening of a (courtyard) and the stream of Qanat flowed for one month, and none came from any part (of Arabia) but with the news of heavy rainfall.
897.03 | Anas b. Malik reported that while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was delivering the sermon on Friday, people stood up before him and said in a loud voice:Apostle of Allah, there is a drought and the trees have become yellow, the animals have died; and the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the narration transmitted by 'Abd al-A'la the words are:" The clouds cleard from Medina and it began to rain around it and not a single drop of rain fell in Medina. And as I looked towards Medina, I found it hollow like (the hollowness of) a basin.
897.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Anas but with this addition:" Allah gathered the clouds and as we (were obliged) to stay back I saw that even the strong man, impelled by a desire to go to his family, (could not do so)."
897.05 | 'Ubaidullah b. Anas b. Malik heard (his father) Anas b. Malik as saying:A bedouin came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on Friday as he was (delivering the sermon on his) pulpit; and the rest of the hadith is the same but with this addition:" I saw the cloud clearing just as a sheet is folded."
898 | Anas (b. Malik) reported:It rained upon us as we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) removed his cloth (from a part of his body) till the rain fell on it. We said: Messenger of Allah, why did you do this? He said: It is because it (the rainfall) has just come from the Exalted Lord.
899.01 | 'Ata' b. Abi Rabah reported that he heard 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him), as saying:When there was on any day windstorm or dark cloud (its effects) could be read on the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he moved forward and backward (in a state of anxiety) ; and when it rained, he was delighted and it (the state of restlessness) disappeared. 'A'isha said: I asked him the reason of this anxiety and he said: I was afraid that it might be a calamity that might fall upon my Ummah, and when he saw rainfall he said: It is the mercy (of Allah).
899.02 | 'Ata' b. Rabah reported on the authority of 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him), who said:Whenever the wind was stormy, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say: O Allah! I ask Thee for what is good in it, and the good which it contains, and the good of that which it was sent for. I seek refuge with Thee from what is evil in it, what evil it contains, and the evil of that what it was sent for; and when there was a thunder and lightning in the sky, his colour underwent a change, and he went out and in, backwards and forwards; and when the rain came, he felt relieved, and I noticed that (the sign of relief) on his face. 'A'isha asked him (about it) and he said: It may be as the people of 'Ad said: When they saw a cloud formation coming to their valley they said:" It is a cloud which would give us rain" (Qur'an, xlvi. 24).
899.03 | 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), reported:I never saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) laugh to such an extent that I could see his uvula-whereas he used to smile only-and when he saw dark clouds or wind, (the signs of fear) were depicted on his face. I said: Messenger of Allah, I find people being happy when they ace the dark cloud in the hope that it would bring rain, but I find that when you see that (the cloud) there is an anxiety on your face. He said: 'A'isha, I am afraid that there may be a calamity in it, for a people was afflicted with wind, when the people saw the calamity they said:" It is a cloud which would give us rain" (Qur'an. xlvi. 24).
900.01 | Ibn 'Abbas reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:I have been helped by the east wind and the 'Ad were destroyed by the west wind.
900.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas through another chain of transmitters.
901.01 | 'A'isha reported that there was a solar eclipse in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He stood up to pray and prolonged his stand very much. He then bowed and prolonged very much his bowing. He then raised his head and prolonged his stand much, but it was less than the (duration) of the first stand. He then bowed and prolonged bowing much, but it was less than the duration of his first bowing. He then prostrated and then stood up and prolonged the stand, but it was less than the first stand. He then bowed and prolonged his bowing, but it was less than the first bowing. He then lifted his head and then stood up and prolonged his stand, but it was less than the first stand. He then bowed and prolonged bowing and it was less than the first bowing. He then prostrated himself; then he turned about, and the sun had become bright, and he addressed the people. He praised Allah and landed Him and said:The sun and the moon are two signs of Allah; they are not eclipsed on account of anyones death or on account of anyone's birth. So when you see them, glorify and supplicate Allah, observe prayer, give alms. O Ummah of Muhammad, none is more indignant than Allah When His servant or maid commits fornication. O people of Muhammad, by Allah, if you knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little.
901.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Hisham b. 'Urwa with the same chain of transmitters but with this addition:" Verily the sun and the moon are among the signs of Allah." And similarly this addition was made:" He then lifted his hands and said: O Allah! have I not conveyed it?"
901.03 | 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), reported There was an eclipse of the sun during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) went to the mosque and stood up and glorified Allah, and the people formed themselves in rows behind him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a long recital (of the Qur'an) and then pronounced takbir and then observed a long ruku'. He then raised his head and said:Allah listened to him who praised Him: our Lord, praise is due to Thee. He then again stood up and made a long recital, which was less than the first recital. He pronounced takbir and observed a long ruku', and it was less than the first one. He again said: Allah listened to him who praised Him; our Lord, praise is due to Thee. (Abu Tahir, one of the narrators) made no mention of:" He then prostrated himself." He did like this in the second rak'ah, till he completed four rak'ahs and four prostrations and the sun became bright before he deported. He then stood up and addressed people, after lauding Allah as He deserved, and then said: The sun and the moon are two signs among the signs of Allah These do not eclipse either on the death of anyone or on his birth. So when you see them, hasten to prayer. He also said this: Observe prayer till Allah dispels the anxiety (of this extraordinary phenomenon) from you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I saw in my place everything which you have been promised. I even saw myself desiring to pluck a bunch (of grapes) from Paradise (and it was at the time) when you saw me moving forward. And I saw Hell and some of its parts crushing the others, when you saw me moving back; and I saw in it Ibn Luhayy and he was the person who made the she-camels loiter about. In the hadith transmitted by Abu Tahir the words are:" He hastened to prayer," and he made no mention of what follows.
901.04 | 'A'isha reported that there was a solar eclipse during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) and he sent the announcer (to summon them) for congregational prayer. The people gathered together and he pronounced takbir and he observed four rak'ahs, in the form of two rak'ahs (i. e. he observed two qiyams and two ruku's in one rak'ah) and four prostrations.
901.05 | 'A'isha reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited loudly in the eclipse prayer, and he observed four rak'ahs in the form of two rak'ahs and four prostrations. Zuhri said:Kathir b. 'Abbas narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed four rak'ahs and four prostrations in two rak'ahs.
902.02 | Zuhri said:Kathir b. Abbas used to narrate that Ibn 'Abbas used to relate about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in regard to the eclipse of the sun like that what was narrated by 'Urwa on the authority of 'A'isha.
901.06 | 'Ata' reported:I heard 'Ubaid b. 'Umair say: It has been narrated to me by one whom I regard as truthful, (the narrator says: I can well guess that he meant 'A'isha) that the sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he stood up (in prayer) for a rigorously long time. He then bowed and then stood up and then bowed and then stood up and then bowed, thus observing three ruku's in two rak'ahs and four prostrations. He then departed and the sun brightened. He pronounced" Allah is the Greatest" while bowing. He would then bow and say:" Allah listened to him who praised Him" while lifting up his head. He then stood up, and praised Allah and lauded Him, and then said: The sun and the moon do not eclipse on the death of anyone or on his birth. But both of them are among the signs of Allah with which Allah terrifies His servants. So when you see them under eclipse, remember Allah till they are brightened.
901.07 | This hadith is narrated thus on the authority of 'A'isha through another chain of transmitters:" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed six ruku's and four prostration in (two rak'ahs)."
903.01 | 'Amra reported that a Jewess came to 'A'isha to ask (about something) and said:May Allah protect you from the torment of the grave! 'A'isha said: Messenger of Allah, would people be tormented in the graves? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: (May there be) protection of Allah! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mounted one morning on the ride, and the sun eclipsed. 'A'isha said: I came in the company of the women in the mosque from behind the rooms. The Messenger of Allah (way peace he upon him) dismounted from his ride and came to the place of worship where he used to pray. He stood up (to pray) and the people stood behind him. 'A'isha said: He stood for a long time. He then bowed and it was a long ruku'. He then raised his head and he stood for a long time, less than the first standing. He then bowed and his ruku' was long, but it was less than that (the first) ruku'. He then raised (his head) and the sun had become bright. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: I saw you under trial in the grave like the turmoil of Dajjal. 'Amra said: I heard 'A'isha say: I listened after this to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) seeking refuge from the torment of Fire and the torment of the grave.
903.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Yahya b. Sa'id with the same chain of transmitters.
904.01 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:The sun eclipsed on one extremely hot day during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed along with his Companions. He prolonged his qiyam (standing posture in prayer) till they (his Companions) began to fall down. He then observed a long ruku'. He raised his head (and stood up for long) and then observed a long ruku'. He then raised (his head and stood up) for a long time and then made two prostrations. He then stood up and did like this and thus he observed four ruku's and four prostrations (in two rak'ahs) and then said: All these things were brought to me in which you will be made to enter. Paradise was brought to me till (I was so close to it) that if I (had intended) to pluck a bunch (of grapes) out of it. I would have got it, or he (the Holy Prophet) said: I intended to get a bunch (out of that) but my hand could not reach it. Hell was also brought to me and I saw in it a woman belonging to the tribe of Israel who was tormented for a cat whom she had tied, but did not give it food nor set it free to eat the creatures of the earth; and I saw Abu Thumama 'Amr b. Malik who was dragging his intestines in Hell. They (the Arabs) used to say that the sun and the moon do not eclipse but on the death of some great person; but (in reality) both these (the sun and the moon) are among the signs of Allah which are shown to you; so when there is an eclipse, observe prayer till it (the sun or the moon) brightens. This hadith has been narrated by Hisham with the same chain of transmitters except this" I saw a dark woman with a tail stature and loud voice," but he made no mention of" from among Bani Israel".
904.03 | Jabir reported that the sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on that very day when Ibrahim (the Prophet's son) died. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and led people in (two rak'ahs of) prayer with six ruku's and four prostrations. He commenced (the prayer) with takbir (Allah-o-Akbar) and then recited and prolonged his recital. He then bowed nearly the (length of time) that he stood up. He then raised his head from the ruku' and recited but less than the first recital. He then bowed (to the length of time) that he stood up. He then raised his head from the ruku' and again recited but less than the second recital. He then bowed (to the length of time) that he stood up. He then lifted his head from the ruku'. He then fell in prostration and observed two prostrations. He stood up and then bowed, observing six ruku's like it, without (completing) the rak'ah in them, except (this difference) that the first (qiyam of ruku') was longer than the later one, and the ruku' was nearly (of the same length) as prostration. He then moved backward and the rows behind him also moved backward till we reached the extreme (Abu Bakr said:till he reached near the women) He then moved forward and the people also moved forward along with him till he stood at his (original) place (of worship). He then completed the prayer as it was required to complete and the sun brightened and he said: O people! verily the sun and the moon are among the signs of Allah and they do not eclipse at the death of anyone among people (Abu Bakr said: On the death of any human being). So when you see anything like it (of the nature of eclipse), pray till it is bright. There is nothing which you have been promised (in the next world) but I have seen it in this prayer of mine. Hell was brought to me as you saw me moving back on account of fear lest its heat might affect me; and I saw the owner of the curved staff who dragged his intestines in the fire, and he used to steal (the belongings) of the pilgrims with his curved staff. If he (the owner of the staff) became aware, he would say: It got (accidentally) entangled in my curved staff, but if he was unaware of that, he would take that away. I also saw in it (in Hell) the owner of a cat whom she had tied and did not feed her nor set her free so that she could eat the creatures of the earth, till the cat died of starvation. Paradise was brought to me, and it was on that occasion that you saw me moving forward till I stood at my place (of worship). I stretched my hand as I wanted to catch hold of its fruits so that you may see them. Then I thought of not doing it. Nothing which you have been promised was there that I did not see in this prayer of mine.
905.01 | Asma' reported:The sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). As I went to 'A'isha who was busy in prayer. I said: What is the matter with the people that they are praying (a special prayer)? She ('A'isha) pointed towards the sky with her head. I said: Is it (an unusual) sign? She said: Yes. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up for prayer for such a long time that I was about to faint. I caught hold of a waterskin lying by my side, and began to pour water over my head, or (began to sprinkle water) on my face. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then finished and the sun had brightened. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then addressed the people, (after) praising Allah and lauding Him, and then said: There was no such thing as I did not see earlier, but I saw it at this very place of mine. I ever saw Paradise and Hell. It was also revealed to me that you would be tried in the graves, as you would he tried something like the turmoil of the Dajjal. Asma' said: I do not know which word he actually used (qariban or mithl), and each one of you would be brought and it would be said: What is your knowledge about this man? If the person is a believer, (Asma' said: I do not know whether it was the word al-Mu'min or al-Mu'qin) he would say: He is Muhammad and he is the Messenger of Allah. He brought to us the clear signs and right guidance. So we responded and obeyed him. (He would repeat this three times), and it would be said to him: You should go to sleep. We already knew that you are a believer in him. So the pious man would go to sleep. So far as the hypocrite or sceptic is concerned (Asma' said: I do not know which word was that: al-Munafiq (hypocrite) or al-Murtad (doubtful) he would say: I do not know. I only uttered whatever I heard people say.
905.02 | Asma' said:I came to 'A'isha when the people were standing (in prayer) and she was also praying. I said: What is this excitement of the people for? And the rest of the hadith was narrated like one, (narrated above). 'Urwa said: Do not say Kasafat-ush-Shamsu, but say Khasafat-ush-Shamsu.
906.01 | Asma' bint Abu Bakr said:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) was one day (i. e. on the day when the sun eclipsed) so perturbed that he (in haste) took hold of the outer garment (of a female member of his family) and it was later on that his (own) cloak was sent to him. He stood in prayer along with people for such a long time that if a man came he did not realise that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had observed ruku', as it has been narrated about ruku' in connection with long qiyam.
906.02 | Abu Juraij narrated this hadith with the same chain of transmitters (but with the addition of these words):" It was for a long duration that he (the Holy Prophet) observed qiyam and he would then observe ruku'. (The narrator also added) I (Asma') looked at a woman who was older than I, and at another who was weaker than I.
906.03 | Asma' daughter of Abu Bakr reported:The sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ; so he felt perturbed and he, by mistake, took hold of the outer garment of a woman till he was given his own cloak. After this I satisfied my need and then came and entered the mosque. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) standing in prayer. I stood along with him. He prolonged his qiyam till I wished to sit down. Then I cast a glance towards an old woman. So I said: She is older than I. I, therefore, kept standing. He (the Holy Prophet) then observed ruku', and prolonged his ruku'. He then raised his head. He then prolonged his qiyam to such an extent that if a person happened to come he would have thought that he had not observed the ruku'.
907.01 | Ibn 'Abbas reported:There was an eclipse of the sun during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah, (ﷺ) prayed accompanied by the people. He stood for a long time, about as long as it would take to recite Surah al-Baqara; then he bowed for a long time; then he raised his head and stood for a long time, but it was less than the first qiyam. He then bowed for a long time but for a shorter while than the first. He then prostrated and then stood for a long time, but it was less than the first qiyam. He then bowed for a long time, but it was less than the first bowing. He then raised (his head) and stood for a long time, but it was less than the first qiyam. He then bowed for a long time but it was less than the first bowing. He then observed prostration, and then he finished, and the sun had cleared (by that time). He (the Holy Prophet) then said: The sun and moon are two signs from the signs of Allah. These two do not eclipse on account of the death of anyone or on account of the birth of anyone. So when you see that, remember Allah. They (his Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, we saw you reach out to something, while you were standing here, then we saw you restrain yourself. He said: I saw Paradise and reached out to a bunch of its grapes; and had I taken it you would have eaten of it as long as the world endured. I saw Hell also. No such (abominable) sight have I ever seen as that which I saw today; and I observed that most of its inhabitants were women. They said: Messenger of Allah, on what account is it so? He said: For their ingratitude or disbelief (bi-kufraihinna). It was said: Do they disbelieve in Allah? He said: (Not for their disbelief in God) but for their ingratitude to their husbands and ingratitude to kindness. If you were to treat one of them kindly for ever, but if she later saw anything (displeasing) in you, she would say: I have never seen any good in you.
907.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zaid b. Aslam with the same chain of transmitters except with this difference that he (the narrator said):" then we saw you keeping aloof (back)."
908 | Ibn 'Abbas reported:When there was a solar eclipse the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) observed eight ruku's and four prostrations (in two rak'ahs). This has been narrated by 'Ali also.
909 | Ibn 'Abbas reported:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) observed prayer while it was (solar) eclipse. He recited (the Qur'an in qiyam) and then bowed. He again recited and again bowed. He again recited and again bowed and again recited and again bowed, and then prostrated; and the second (rak'ah) was like this.
910 | 'Amr b. al-'As reported:When the sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), they (the people) were called to congregational prayers. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed two ruku's in one rak'ah. He then stood and observed two ruku's in (the second) rak'ah. The sun then became bright, and 'A'isha said; Never did I observe, ruku' and prostration longer than this (ruku' and prostration).
911.01 | Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Verily the sun and the moon are the two signs among the signs of Allah by which He frightens his servants and they do not eclipse on account of the death of any one of the people. So when you see anything about them, observe prayer, supplicate Allah till it is cleared from you.
911.02 | Abu Mas'ud reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Verily the sun and the moon do not eclipse on account of the death of any one of the people, but they are the two signs among the signs of Allah. So when you see it, stand up and observe prayer.
911.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Isma'il with the same chain of transmitters and in the hadith narrated by Sufyan and Waki' (the words are):" The sun eclipsed on the day when Ibrahim died, and the people said: It has eclipsed on the death of Ibrahim."
912 | Abu Musa reported:The sun eclipsed during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He stood in great anxiety fearing that it might be the Doomsday, till he came to the mosque. He stood up to pray with prolonged qiyam, ruku', and prostration which I never saw him doing in prayer; and then he said: These are the signs which Allah sends, not on account of the death of anyone or life of any one, but Allah sends them to frighten thereby His servants. So when you see any such thing, hasten to remember Him, supplicate Him and beg pardon from Him, and in the narration transmitted by Ibn 'Ala the words are:" The sun eclipsed"."" He frightens His servants."
913.01 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Samura said:During the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I was shooting my arrows in Medina, when an eclipse of the sun took place. I, therefore, threw them away and said, I must see how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) acts in a solar eclipse today. When I came to him, he had been supplicating with his hands, raised, pronouncing Allah-o-Akbar, praising Him, acknowledging that He is One God till the eclipse was over, then he recited two surahs and prayed two rak'ahs.
913.02 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Samura, who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:During the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I was shooting some of my arrows in Medina, when the sun eclipsed. I threw (the arrows) and said: By Allah, I must see how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) acts in solar eclipse. So I came to him and he was standing in prayer, raising his hands, glorifying Him, praising Him, acknowledging His Oneness, declaring His greatness, and supplicating Him, till the sun cleared. When the eclipse was over, he recited two surahs and prayed two rak'ahs.
913.03 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Samura reported:I was shooting some of my arrows during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that the sun eclipsed. The rest of the hadith is the same.
914 | 'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed:Verily the sun and the moon do not eclipse on account of the death or life of anyone. They are in fact the signs among the signs of Allah. So when you see them, observe prayer.
915 | Ziyad b. 'Ilaqa reported:I heard Mughira b. Shu'ba saying that the sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the day when Ibrahim died. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Verily the sun and the moon are the two signs among the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse on account of the death of anyone or on account of the birth of anyone. So when you see them, supplicate Allah, and observe prayer till it is over.
916.01 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Exhort to recite" There is no god but Allah" to those of you who are dying.
916.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Sulaiman b. Bilal with the same chain of transmitters.
917 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Exhort to recite" There is no god but Allah" to those of you who are dying.
918.01 | Umm Salama reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If any Muslim who suffers some calamity says, what Allah has commanded him," We belong to Allah and to Him shall we return; O Allah, reward me for my affliction and give me something better than it in exchange for it," Allah will give him something better than it in exchange. When Abu Salama died she said: What Muslim is better than Abu Salama whose family was the first to emigrate to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I then said the words, and Allah gave me God's Messenger (ﷺ) in exchange. She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent Hatib b. Abu Balta'a to deliver me the message of marriage with him. I said to him: I have a daughter (as my dependant) and I am of jealous temperament. He (the Holy Prophet) said: So far as her daughter is concerned, we would supplicate Allah, that He may free her (of her responsibility) and I would also supplicate Allah to do away with (her) jealous (temperament).
918.02 | Umm Salama, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If any servant (of Allah) who suffers a calamity says:" We belong to Allah and to Him shall we return; O Allah, reward me for my affliction and give me something better than it in exchange for it," ' Allah will give him reward for affliction, and would give him something better than it in exchange. She (Umm Salama) said: When Abu Salama died. I uttered (these very words) as I was commanded (to do) by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So Allah gave me better in exchange than him. i. e. (I was taken as the wife of) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
918.03 | Umm Salama, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him), reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying like the hadith transmitted by Abu Usama, but with this addition that she said:" When Abu Salama died I said: Who is better than Abu Salama, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and Allah decided for me and I said (these words contained in the supplication mentioned above) and I was married to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
919 | Umm Salama reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Whenever you visit the sick or the dead, supplicate for good because angels say" Amen" to whatever you say. She added: When Abu Salama died, I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, Abu Salama has died. He told me to recite:" O Allah! forgive me and him (Abu Salama) and give me a better substitute than he." So I said (this), and Allah gave me in exchange Muhammad, who is better for me than him (Abu Salama).
920.01 | Umm Salama reported:The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon came to Abu Salama (as he died). His eyes were fixedly open. He closed them, and then said: When the soul is taken away the sight follows it. Some of the people of his family wept and wailed. So he said: Do not supplicate for yourselves anything but good, for angels say" Amen" to what you say. He then said: O Allah, forgive Abu Salama, raise his degree among those who are rightly guided, grant him a successor in his descendants who remain. Forgive us and him, O Lord of the Universe, and make his grave spacious, and grant him light in it.
920.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Khalid al Hadhdha' with the same chain of transmitters but with this alteration that he said:(O Allah! ) let Thee be the caretaker of what is left by him, and he said: Grant him expansion of the grave, but he did not say: Make his grave spacious. Khalid said: He supplicated for the seventh (thing too) which I have forgotten.
921.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Did you not see when the man died and his eyes were fixedly open? He (Abu Huraira) said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) said: It is due to the fact that when (the soul leaves the body) his eyesight follows the soul.
921.02 | This hadith is narrated on the authority of 'Ala' with the same chain of transmitters.
922 | Umm Salama reported:When Abu Salama died I said: I am a stranger in a strange land; I shall weep for him in a manner that would be talked of. I made preparation for weeping for him when a woman from the upper side of the city came there who intended to help me (in weeping). She happened to come across the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: Do you intend to bring the devil into a house from which Allah has twice driven him out? I (Umm Salama), therefore, refrained from weeping and I did not weep.
923.01 | Usama b. Zaid reported:While we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), one of his daughters sent to him (the Messenger) to call him and inform him that her child or her son was dying. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told the messenger to go back and tell her that what Allah had taken belonged to Him, and to him belonged what He granted; and He has an appointed time for everything. So you (the messenger) order her to show endurance and seek reward from Allah. The messenger came back and said: She adjures him to come to her. He got up to go accompanied by Sa'd b. 'Ubada, Mu'adh b. Jabal, and I also went along with them. The child was lifted to him and his soul was feeling as restless as if it was in an old (waterskin). His (Prophet's) eyes welled up with tears. Sa'd said: What is this, Messenger of Allah? He replied: This is compassion which Allah has placed in the hearts of His servants, and God shows compassion only to those of His servants who are compassionate.
923.02 | This hadith has been narrated by another chain of transmitters on the authority of 'Asim al-Ahwal.
924 | 'Abdullah b. 'Umar said that Sa'd b. Ubada complained of illness. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to visit him accompanied by 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf, Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas and 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud. As he entered (his room) he found him in a swoon. Upon this he said:Has he died? They said: Messenger of Allah, it is not so. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wept. When the people saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) weeping, they also began to weep. He said. Listen, Allah does not punish for the tears that the eye sheds or the grief the heart feels, but He punishes for this (pointing to his tongue), or He may show mercy.
925 | 'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported:While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), a person, one of the Ansar, came to him and greeted him. The Ansari then turned back. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: o brother of Ansar, how is my brother Sa'd be 'Ubada? He said: He is better. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who amongst you would visit him? He (the Holy Prophet) stood up and we also got up along with him, and we were more than ten persons. We had neither shoes with us, nor socks, nor caps, nor shirts. We walked on the barren land till we came to him. The people around him kept away till the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions with him came near him (Sa'd b. 'Ubada).
926.01 | Anas b. Malik reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Endurance is to be shown at the first blow.
926.02 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to a woman who had been weeping for her (dead) child, and said to her:Fear Allah and show endurance. She (not recognising him) said: You have not been afflicted as I have been. When he (the Holy Prophet) had departed, it was said to her that he was the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), she was mortally shocked. She came to his door and she did not find doorkeepers at his door. She said: Messenger of Allah. I did not recognise you. He said: Endurance is to be shown at first blow, or at the first blow.
926.03 | A hadith like this is narrated with the same chain of transmitters but with the addition of these words:" The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) happened to pass by a woman (who was sitting) by the side of a grave."
927.01 | 'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported that Hafsa wept for 'Umar (when he was about to die). He ('Umar) said:Be quiet, my daughter. Don't you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said:" The deceased is punished because of his family's weeping over the death"?
927.02 | Umar reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:The dead is punished in the grave because of wailing on it.
927.03 | The same hadith is narrated on the authority of 'Umar through another chain of transmitters.
927.04 | Ibn 'Umar reported:When 'Umar was wounded he fainted, and there was a loud lamentation over him. When he regained consciousness he said: Didn't you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" The dead is punished because of the weeping of the living"?
927.05 | Abu Burda narrated on the authority of his father that when 'Umar was wounded Suhaib uttered (loudly in lamentation):O brother! Upon this 'Umar said: Suhaib, did you not know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" The dead is punished because of the lamentation of the living"?
927.06 | Abu Musa reported that when 'Umar was wounded, there came Suhaib from his house and went to 'Umar and stood by his side, and began to wail. Upon this 'Umar said:What are you weeping for? Are you weeping for me? He said: By Allah, it is for you that I weep, O Commander of the believers. He said: By Allah, you already know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said: He who is lamented upon is punished. I made a mention of it to Musa b. Talha, and he said that 'A'isha told that it concerned the Jews (only).
927.07 | Anas reported that when 'Umar b. Khattab was wounded Hafsa lamented for him. Upon this he said:O Hafsa, did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying:" One who is lamented would be punished"? Suhaib also lamented over him. 'Umar told him also: O Suhaib, didn't you know that one who is lamented is punished?
928.01 | 'Abdullah b. Abu Mulaika reported:I was sitting by the side of Ibn 'Umar, and we were waiting for the bier of Umm Aban, daughter of 'Uthman, and there was also 'Amr b. 'Uthman. In the meanwhile there came Ibn 'Abbas led by a guide. I conceive that he was informed of the place of Ibn 'Umar. So he came till he sat by my side. While I was between them (Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn 'Umar) there came the noise (of wailing) from the house. Upon this Ibn 'Umar said (that is, he pointed out to 'Amr that he should stand and forbid them, for): I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: The dead is punished because of the lamentation of his family. 'Abdullah made it general (what was said for a particular occasion). Ibn 'Abbas said: When we were with the Commander of the believers, 'Umar b. Khattab, we reached Baida', and there was a man under the shadow of the tree. He said to me: Go and inform me who is that person. So I went and (found) that he was Suhaib. I returned to him and said: You commanded me to find out for you who that was, and he is Suhaib. He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: Command him to see us. I said: He has family along with him. He said: (That is of no account) even if he has family along with him. So he (the narrator) told him to see (the Commander of the believers and his party). When we came (to Medina), it was before long that the Commander of the believers was wounded, and Suhaib came weeping and crying: Alas for the brother, alas for the companion. Upon this 'Umar said: Didn't you know, or didn't you hear, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" The dead is punished because of the lamentation of his family"? Then 'Abdullah made it general and 'Umar told it of certain occasions. So I ('Abdullah b. Abu Mulaika) stood up and went to 'A'isha and told her what Ibn 'Umar had said. Upon this she said: I swear by Allah that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never said that dead would be punished because of his family's lamenting (for him). What he said was that Allah would increase the punishment of the unbeliever because of his family's lamenting for him. Verily it is Allah Who has caused laughter and weeping. No bearer of a burden will bear another's burden. Ibn Abu Mulaika said that al-Qasim b. Muhammad said that when the words of 'Umar and Ibn 'Umar were conveyed to 'A'isha, she said: You have narrated it to me from those who are neither liar nor those suspected of lying but (sometimes) hearing misleads.
928.02 | 'Abdullah b. Abu Mulaika said:The daughter of 'Uthman b. 'Affan died in Mecca. We came to attend her (funeral). Ibn 'Umar and Ibn 'Abbas were also present there, and I was sitting between them. He added: I (first sat) by the side of one of them, then the other one came and he sat by my side. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar said to 'Amr b. 'Uthman who was sitting opposite to him: Will you not prevent the people from lamenting, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said:" The dead is punished because of the lamenting of his family for him"? Ibn 'Abbas then said that Umar used to say someting of that nature, and then narrated saying: I proceeded from Mecca along with 'Umar till we reached al-Baida' and there was a party of riders under the shade of a tree. He said (to me): Go and find out who this party is. I cast a glance and there was Suhaib (in that party). So I informed him ('Umar) about it. He said: Call him to me. So I went back to Suhaib and said: Go and meet the Commander of the believers. When 'Umar was wounded, Suhaib came walling: Alas, for the brother! alas for the companion! 'Umar said: O Suhaib, do you wail for me, whereas the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" The dead would be punished on account of the lamentation of the (members of his family)"? Ibn 'Abbas said: When 'Umar died I made a mention of it to 'A'isha. She said: May Allah have mercy upon 'Umar! I swear by Allah that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never said that Allah would punish the believer because of the weeping (of any one of the members of his family), but he said that Allah would increase the punishment of the unbeliever because of the weeping of his family over him. 'A'isha said: The Qur'an is enough for you (when it states):" No bearer of burden will bear another's burden" (vi. 164). Thereupon Ibn 'Abbas said: Allah is He Who has caused laughter and weeping. Ibn Abu Mulaika said: By Allah, Ibn 'Umar said nothing.
929.03 | 'Amr reported on the authority of Ibn Abu Mulaika:We were with the bier of Umm Aban, daughter of 'Uthman, and the rest of the hadith is the same, but he did not narrate it as a marfu' hadith on the authority of 'Umar from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as it was narrated by Ayyub and Ibn Juraij, and the hadith narrated by them (Ayyub and Ibn Juraij) is more complete than that of 'Amr.
930 | 'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:The dead is punished because of the lamentation of the living.
931 | Hisham b. 'Urwa narrated on the authority of his father that the saying of Ibn 'Umar, viz." The dead would be punished because of the lamentation of his family over him" was mentioned to 'A'isha. Upon this she said:May Allah have mercy upon Abu 'Abd al-Rahman (the kunya of Ibn 'Umar) that he heard something but could not retain it (well). (The fact is) that the bier of a Jew passed before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and (the members of his family) were waiting over him. Upon this he said: You are wailing and he is being punished.
932.01 | Hisham narrated on the authority of his father that it was mentioned to 'A'isha that Ibn 'Umar had narrated as marfu' hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that the dead would be punished in the grave because of the lamentation of his family for him. Upon this she said:He (Ibn 'Umar) missed (the point). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had (in fact) said: He (the dead) is punished for his faults or for his sins, and the members of his family are wailing for him now. (This misunderstanding of Ibn 'Umar is similar to his saying: ) The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood by the well in which were lying the dead bodies of those polytheists who had been killed on the Day of Badr, and he said to them what he had to say, i. e.: They hear what I say. But he (Ibn 'Umar) misunderstood. The Prophet (ﷺ) had only said: They (the dead) understand that what I used to say to them was truth. She then recited:" Certainly, thou canst not make the dead hear the call" (xxvii. 80), nor can you make those hear who are in the graves, nor can you inform them when they have taken their seats in Hell.
932.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Ibn 'Urwa with the same chain of transmitters. The hadith narrated by Abu Usama is more complete.
932.03 | 'Amra daughter of 'Abd al Rahman narrated that she heard (from) 'A'isha and made a mention to her about 'Abdullah b. 'Umar as saying:The dead is punished because of the lamentation of the living. Upon this 'A'isha said: May Allah have mercy upon the father of 'Abd al-Rahman (Ibn 'Umar). He did not tell a lie, but he forgot or made a mistake. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) happened to pass by a (dead) Jewess who was being lamented. Upon this he said: They weep over her and she is being punished in the grave.
933.01 | 'Ali b. Rabi'a reported that the first one who was lamented upon in Kufa was Qaraza b. Ka'b. Mughira b. Shu'ba said:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: He who is lamented upon would be punished because of the lamentation for him on the Day of judgment.
933.02 | A hadith like this has been narrated by Mughira b. Shu'ba from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
933.03 | This hadith has been narrated from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) through another chain of transmitters.
934 | Abu Malik al-Ash'ari reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Among my people there are four characteristics belonging to pre-Islamic period which they do not abandon: boasting of high rank, reviling other peoples' genealogies, seeking rain by stars, and walling. And he (further) said: If the wailing woman does not repent before she dies, she will be made to stand on the Day of Resurrection wearing a garment of pitch and a chemise of mange.
935.01 | 'A'isha reported that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was told that Ibn Haritha, Ja'far b. Abu Talib and Abdullah b. Rawaha were killed, he sat down, showing signs of grief. She (further) said:I was looking (at him) through the crevice of the door. A man came to him and mentioned that Ja'far's women were lamenting. He (the Holy Prophet) commanded him to go and forbid them (to do so). So he went away but came back and told (him) that they did not obey (him). He commanded him a second time to go and forbid them (to do so). He again went but came back to him and said: I swear by God, Messenger of Allah, that they have overpowered us. She ('A'isha) said that she thought the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had told (her) to throw dust in their mouths. Thereupon 'A'isha said: May Allah humble you! You did not do what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered you, nor did you stop annoying Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
935.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Yahya b. Sa'id with the same chain of transmitters like one narrated by 'Abd al-'Aziz (with the change of these words):" You did not spare the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) the botheration."
936.01 | Umm 'Atiyya reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took a promise from us along with the oath of Allegiance that we would not lament. But only five among us fulfilled the promise (and they are) Umm Sulaim, and Umm al-'Ala', and the daughter of Abu Sabra the wife of Mu'adh, or daughter of Abu Sabra and wife of Mu'adh.
936.02 | Umm 'Atiyya reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took pledge from us (including this promise) that we would not lament. Only five amongst us fulfilled the promise, and one of them (who fulfilled the promise) was Umm Sulaim.
937 | Hafsa narrated on the authority of Umm 'Atiyya that she said:When this verse was revealed:" When believing women came to thee giving thee a pledge that they will not associate aught with Allah, and will not disobey thee in good" (lx. 12), she (Umm Atiyya) said: In (this pledge) was also included wailing. I said: Messenger of Allah, except members of such a tribe who helped me (in lamentation) during pre-Islamic days, there is left no alternative for me, but that I should also help them. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: (Yes) but only in case of the members of such a tribe.
938.01 | Umm 'Atiyya reported:We were forbidden to follow the bier, but it was not made absolute on us.
938.02 | Umm 'Atiyya reported:We were refrained from following the bier, but it was not made absolute on us.
939.01 | Umm 'Atiyya reported:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) came to us when we were bathing his daughter, and he told us: Wash her with water and (with the leaves of) the lote tree, three or five times, or more than that if you think fit, and put camphor or something like camphor in the last washing; then inform me when you have finished. So when we had finished, we informed him, and he gave to us his (own) under-garment saying:" Put it next her body."
939.02 | Umm 'Atiyya reported:We braided her hair in three plaits.
939.03 | Umm 'Atiyya reported:One of the daughters of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died. And in the hadith transmitted by Ibn 'Ulayya (the words are): The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us and we were washing his daughter. And in the hadith transmitted by Malik (the words are): There came in (our apartment) the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) when his daughter died. The rest of the hadith is the same as narrated by Yazid b. Zurai' from Ayyub from Muhammad from Umm 'Atiyya.
939.04 | A hadith like this has been transmitted by Hafsa on the authority of Umm 'Atiyya with the exception (of these words that the Prophet asked them to wash her dead body):" three times, five times, seven times, or more than that, if you deem fit:" Hafsa (further) said on the authority of Umm 'Atiyya: We braided (the hair) of her head in three plaits.
939.05 | Umm 'Atiyya reported:We washed her an odd number of times, i. e. three, five or seven times; and Umm 'Atiyya (further) said: We braided her hair in three plaits.
939.06 | Umm 'Atiyya reported:When Zainab the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, he said to us: Wash her odd number of times, i. e. three or five times, and put camphor or something-like camphor at the fifth time, and after you have washed her inform me. So we informed him and he gave us his under-garment, saying:" Put it next her body."
939.07 | Umm 'Atiyya reported:There came to us the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as we were washing one of his daughters. So he said: Wash her (dead body) an odd number of times, five times or more than that, the rest of the hadith is the same. She (further) said: We braided her hair in three plaits: (two) on the sides of her head and one on her forehead.
939.08 | Umm 'Atiyya reported that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked her to wash his daughter, he told her to start from the right side, and with those parts of the body over which Wudu' is performed.
939.09 | Umm 'Atiyya reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to them (the women) in regard to the washing of his daughter to start from the right side and with those parts of the body over which Wudu' is performed.
940.01 | Khabbab al-Aratt reported:We migrated with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the path of Allah seeking Allah's pleasure alone. Thus our reward was assured with Allah. And amongst us were those who spent life (in such a state of piety and austerity) that nothing consumed their reward. Mus'ab b. 'Umair was one of them. He was killed on the Day of Uhud, and nothing but a woollen cloak was found to shroud him. When we covered his head with it, his feet became uncovered, and when we covered his feet, his head was uncovered. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Place it (this cloak) on the side of his head and cover his feet with grass. And there is one amongst us for whom the fruit is ripened and he enjoys it.
940.02 | A hadith like this has been narrated by 'Uyaina on the authority of A'mash with the same chain of transmitters.
941.01 | 'A'isha reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was shrouded in three cotton garments of white Yamani stuff from Sahul, among which was neither a shirt nor a turban; and so far as Hullah is concerned there was some doubt about it in the minds of people, that it was brought for him in order to shroud him with it, but it was abandoned, and he was shrouded in three cotton garments of white Yamani stuff from Sahul. Then 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr got it and said:I would keep it in order to shroud myself in it. He then said: If Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, would have desired it for His Apostle, he would have been shrouded with it. So he sold it and gave its price in charity.
941.02 | 'A'isha reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was wrapped in a Yamani wrapper which belonged to 'Abdullah b Abu Bakr; then it was removed from him, and he was shrouded in three cotton sheets of white Yamani stuff from Sahul among which was neither a shirt nor a turban. 'Abdullah took up the Hullah and said:I would be shrouded in it, but then said: How is it that I should be shrouded in it in which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was not shrouded! So he gave it in charity.
941.03 | This hadith is narrated on the authority of Hisham with the same chain of transmitters, but in the hadith narrated by him there is no mention of the story of 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr.
941.04 | Abu Salama said:I asked 'A'isha with how many garments the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was shourded. She said: With three garments of Sahul.
942.01 | 'A'isha reported:When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upom him) died, he was covered with a Yamani wrapper.
942.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.
943 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) one day in the course of his sermon made mention of a person among his Companions who had died and had been wrapped in a shroud not long (enough to cover his whole body) and was buried during the night. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) reprimanded (the audience) that a person was buried during the night (in a state that) funeral prayer could not be offered (over him by the Messenger of Allah).

Ibn 'Umar sent Khabbab to 'A'isha in order to ask her about the words of Abu Huraira (and also told him) to come back to him (Ibn 'Umar) and inform him what 'A'isha said. (In the meanwhile) Ibn 'Umar took up a handful of pebbles and turned them over in his hand till the messenger (Khabbab) came back to him and told (him) that 'A'isha testified (the statement of) Abu Huraira.

She said: When it was my turn for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to spend the night with me, he turned his side, put on his mantle and took off his shoes and placed them near his feet, and spread the corner of his shawl on his bed and then lay down till he thought that I had gone to sleep.

I said: There is nothing. He said: Tell me or the Subtle and the Aware would inform me. I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be ransom for you, and then I told him (the whole story). He said: Was it the darkness (of your shadow) that I saw in front of me? I said: Yes. He gave me a nudge on the chest which I felt, and then said: Did you think that Allah and His Apostle would deal unjustly with you? She said: Whatsoever the people conceal, Allah will know it. He said: Gabriel came to me when you saw me. He called me and he concealed it from you. I responded to his call, but I too concealed it from you (for he did not come to you), as you were not fully dressed. I thought that you had gone to sleep, and I did not like to awaken you, fearing that you may be frightened. He (Gabriel) said: Your Lord has commanded you to go to the inhabitants of Baqi' (to those lying in the graves) and beg pardon for them. I said: Messenger of Allah, how should I pray for them (How should I beg forgiveness for them)? He said: Say, Peace be upon the inhabitants of this city (graveyard) from among the Believers and the Muslims, and may Allah have mercy on those who have gone ahead of us, and those who come later on, and we shall, God willing, join you.

984.04 | Abdullah b. Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered the (payment of) Zakat-ul-Fitr one sa' of dates, or one sa' of barley. Ibn 'Umar ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) further said:The people equalised it (then) with two mudds of fine wheat.
984.05 | Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prescribed Zakat-ul-Fitr of Ramadan one sa' of dates or one sa' of barley for every individual among the Muslims (whether) free man or slave, male or female, young or old.
985.01 | Sad b. Abu Sarh heard Abu Sa'id al-Khudri as saying:We used to take out as the Zakat of Fitr one sa' of grain, or one sa' of barley or one sa' of dates, or one sa' of cheese or one sa' of raisins.
985.02 | Abd Sa'id al-Khudri reported:We, on behalf of every young or old, free man or slave (amongst us), used to take out during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as the Zakat of Fitr one sa' of grain, or one sa' of cheese or one sa' of raisins. And we continued taking out these till Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan came to us for pilgrimage or 'Umra, and addressed the people on the pulpit and said to them: I see that two mudds of zakat out of the wheat (red) of Syria is equal to one sa' of dates. So the people accepted it. But Abu Sa'id said: I would continue to take out as I used to take out (before, i e. one sa') as long as I live.
985.03 | Sa'd b. Abu Sarh heard Abu Sa'id al-Khudri as saying:We, on behalf of young or old, free or slave, used to take out the Zakat of Fitr while the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) was among us, in three kinds, one sa' of dates, one sa' of cheese, or one sa' of barley, and we continued to take that out till the time of Mu'awiya, for he saw that two mudds of wheat were equal to one sa' of dates. Abu Sa'id sald: I would continue to take that out as before (i e. one sa' of wheat).
985.04 | Abu Sa'id al Khudri reported:We used to take out the Zakat of Fitr in three kinds, cheese, dates and barley.
985.05 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that when Mu'awiya prescribed half a sa' of wheat equal to one sa' of dates, he (Abu Sa'id al-Khudri) objected to it, and said:I would take out (Sadaqat-ul-Fitr) but that which I used to bring forth during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one sa' of dates, or one sa' of raisins, or one sa' of barley, or one sa' of cheese.

987.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying:If any owner of gold or silver does not pay what is due on him, when the Day of Resurrection would come, plates of fire would be beaten out for him; these would then be heated in the fire of Hell and his sides, his forehead and his back would be cauterized with them. Whenever these cool down, (the process is) repeated during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among servants, and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the camel? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If any owner of the camel does not pay what is due on him, and of his due in that (camel) is (also) to milk it on the day when it comes down to water. When the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy plain would be set for him, as extensive as possible, (he will find) that not a single young one is missing, and they will trample him with their hoofs and bite him with their mouths. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them would be made to return during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among servants and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep? He said: It any owner of the cattle and sheep does not pay what is due on them, when the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy plain would be spread for them, he will find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him the last of them would be made to return to him during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment would be pronounced among the servants. And he would be shown his path-path leading him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the horse? Upon this he said: The horses are of three types. To one than (these are) a burden, and to another man (these are) a covering, and still to another man (these are) a source of reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them in order to show off, for vainglory and for opposing the Muslims; so they are a burden for him. The one for whom these are a covering is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks, and so they are a covering for him. As for those which bring reward (these refer to) the person who rears them for the sake of Allah to be used for Muslims and he puts them in meadow and field. And whatever thing do these eat from that meadow and field would be recorded on his behalf as good deeds, as would also the amount of their dung and urine. And these would not break their halter and prance a course or two without having got recorded the amount of their hoof marks and their dung as a good deed on his behalf (on behalf of their owner). And their master does not bring them past a river from which they drink, though he did not intend to quench their thirst, but Allah would record for him the amount of what they drink on his behalf as deeds. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the asses?, Upon this he said: Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the asses (in particular) except this one verse of a comprehensive nature:" He who does an atom's weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom's weight of evil will see it" (xcix. 7)
987.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Zaid b. Aslam with the same chain of transmitters except that he said:" None among the owners of camels who does not pay their due," but did not say" their due (Zakat) out of them." and he make a mention:" He did not miss a single young one out of them." and he said:" Their sides. their foreheads and their backs would be cauterised."
987.03 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:No owner of the treasure who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but (his hoards) would be heated in the Fire of Hell and these would be made into plates and with these his sides, his forehead would be cauterised till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants during a day, the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. He would then see his path, leading either to Paradise or to Hell. And no owner of the camels who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain would be set for him and they (the camels) would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. He would then see his path leading him to Paradise or leading him to Hell. And no owner of the (cattle and) goats who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain would be set for him, he would find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns, or with broken horns, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs and they would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants, during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, and he would see the paths leading to Paradise or to Hell. Suhail said: I do not know whether he made mention of the cows. They said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), what about the horses? He said: The horses have goodness in their foreheads (or he said) or goodness is ingrained in the foreheads of the horses (Suhail said: I am in doubt as to what was actually said) up till the Day of judgement. The horses are of three kinds. They are a source of reward to a person, they are a covering to a person, and they are a burden to a person. As for those which bring reward is that a person would get reward who rears them for the sake of Allah and trains them for Him, and nothing disappears in their stomachs but Allah would record for him a good deed. And if they were to graze in the meadow, they would eat nothing but Allah would record for him a reward. And if they were to drink water from the canal, with every drop that, would disappear in their stomachs there would be reward (for the owner). He went on describing till a reward was mentioned for their urine and dung. And if they pranced a course or two, there would be recorded a reward for every pace that they covered. As for one for whom they are a covering, he is the man who rears them for honour and dignity but does not forget the right of their backs and their stomachs, in plenty and adversity, As regards one for whom they are a burden, he is that who rears them for vainglory and showing off to the people; for him they are, the burden. They said: Messenger of Allah, what about asses? He said: Allah has not revealed to me anything in regards to it except this one comprehensive verse:" He who does an atom's weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom's weight of evil will see it" (xcix. 7).
987.04 | This hadith has been narrated by Suhail b. Abu Salih with the same chain of transmitters, and he said he substituted the word aqsa' with 'adba' and said:" his side and his back," but he made no mention of his forehead.
987.05 | This hadith has been narrated by Abu Huraira through another chain of transmitters:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" When a person does not pay what is due to Allah or Sadaqa of his camels...." The rest of the hadith is the same.
988.01 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah al-Ansari reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The owner of a camel who does not pay what is due on it (would be punished in this way) that on the Day of Resurrection many more (along with his camel) would come and the owner would be made to sit on a soft sandy ground and they would trample him with their feet and hooves. And no owner of the cattle who does not pay what is due on them (would be spared the punishment) but on the Day of Resurrection, many more would come and he (the owner) would be made to sit on the soft sandy ground and would be gored by their horns and trampled under their feet. And no owner of the goats and sheep who does not pay what is due on them (would be spared of punishment) but many more would come on the Day of Resurrection and he (the owner) would be made to sit on a soft sandy ground and they would gore him with their horns and trample him under their hooves. And there would be more (among this flock of sheep and goat) without horns or with broken horns. And no owner of the treasure who does not pay its due but his treasure would come on the Day of Resurrection like a bald snake and would pursue him with its mouth open, and when it would come near he would run away from it, and he would be called thus:" Take your treasure which you concealed, for I do not need it." When he would find no way out he would put his hand in its mouth and it would gnaw it like a he-camel. Abu Zubair said: We heard Ubaid b. Umair saying this. We then asked Jabir b. 'Abdullah about this. And he also said like Ubaid b. Umair, Abu Zubair said: I heard 'Ubaid b. 'Umair saying: A man said: Messenger of Allah, what is due on camels? He said: Milking them near water, and lending of bucket (used for drawing water from it), or lending its male for mating with a she-camel and providing it as a ride for the sake of Allah.
988.02 | Jabir b. Abdullah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:No owner of camels or cattle or flock of sheep or goats who does not pay his due (would be spared punishment) but would be made to sit on the Day of Resurrection on a soft sandy ground and the hoofed animals would trample him with their hoofs and gore him with their horns. And none of them on that day would be without horns, or with broken horns. We said: Messenger of Allah, but what is due on them? He said: Lending of the male (for use) and lending of the bucket (used for drawing water for them) and for mating and milking them near water and providing them as a ride for the sake of Allah. And no owner of the property who does not pay Zakat (would be spared punishment) but it (his property) would turn into a bald snake and would follow its owner wherever he would go, and he would run away from it, and it would be said to him: That is your property about which you were stingy. And when he would find no other way out he would thrust his hand in its mouth and it would gnaw it like a male camel.
989.01 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:There came people from among the Bedouins to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Collectors of Sadaqa come to us and treat us unjustly. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Please your collectors. Jarir said: Ever since I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) no collector had departed but was pleased with me.
989.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Muhammad b. Isma'il with the same chain of transmitters.
990.01 | Abu Dharr reported:I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was sitting under the shade of the Ka'ba. As he saw me he said: By the Lord of the Ka'ba, they are the losers. I came there till I sat and I could not stay (longer) and (then) stood up. I said: Messenger of Allah, let my father, be ransom for you, who are they (the losers)? He said: They are those having a huge amount of wealth except so and so and (those who spend their wealth generously on them whom they find in front of them, behind them and on their right side and on their left side) and they are a few. And no owner of camels, or cattle or goat and sheep, who does not pay Zakat (would be spared punishment) but these (camels, cattle, goats and sheep) would come on the Day of Resurrection wearing more flesh and would gore him with their horns and trample them with their hooves. And when the last one would pass away, the first one would return (to trample him) till judgment would be pronounced among people.
990.02 | Abu Dbarr reported:I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was sitting under the shade of the Ka'ba, and the rest of the hadith it the same but for this that he (the Holy Prophet) said:" By Allah, in Whose hand is my life, no person on earth who dies and leaves behind camels, or cattle or goat and sheep, and does not pay Zakat (would be spared the punishment)."
991.01 | Abu Huraira reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:Nothing is more delighting to me than this that Uhud should be of gold for me, and no dinar is left with me out of it before three nights pass except a dinar which I would set aside for the repayment of debt upon me.
991.02 | Abu Huraira reported the same from the Prophet (ﷺ).
94.03 | Abu Dharr reported:I walked with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the stony ground of Medina in the afternoon and we were looking at Uhud. The Messenger of Allah (way peace by upon him) said: Abu Dharr! I said: Messenger of Allah, I am here at thy beck and call. He said: What I desire is that Uhud be gold with me and three nights should pass and there is left with me any dinar but one coin which I would keep to pay debt. (I love) to spend it among the servants of Allah like this and he pointed in front of him, and on his right side and on his left side. We then proceeded on and he said: Abu Dharr. I said: At thy beck and call, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: The rich would be poor on the Day of Resurrection, but he who spent like this and like this and like this, and he pointed as at the first time. We again went on when he said. Abu Dharr, stay where you are till I come back to you. He (the Holy Prophet) then moved on till he disappeared from my sight He (Abu Dharr) said: I heard a sound and I heard a noise. I said (to myself): The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) might have met (mishap or an enemy). I wished to follow him but I remembered his command for not departing till he would come back. So I waited for him, and when he came I made a mention of what I heard. He said: it was Gabriel, who came to me and said:" He who dies among your Ummah without associating Anything with Allah would enter Paradise. I said: Even if he committed fornication or theft? He said: Even if he committed fornication or theft.
94.04 | Abu Dharr reported:I went out one night (and found) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) walking all alone. There was no man with him. I thought that he did not like anyone walking along with him. So I began to walk in the light of the moon. He, however turned his attention to me and saw me and said: Who is this? I said: It is Abu Dharr. Let Allah make me as ransom for you. He said: Abu Dharr, come on. He (Abu Dharr) said: So I walked along with him for some time and he said: The wealthy persons would have little (reward) on the Day of Resurrection, except upon whom Allah conferred goodness (wealth). He dispensed it to his right, left, in front of him and at his back (just as the wind diffuses fragrance) and did good with it (riches). I went along with him for some time when He said: Sit here. And he made me sit at a safe place and there were stones around it, and he said to me: Sit here till I come to you. He went away on the stony ground till I could not see him. He stayed away from me, and he prolonged his stay. Then I heard him as he came back and he was saying: Even if he committed theft and even if he committed fornication. When he came I could not help asking him: Apostle of Allah, let Allah make me ransom for you, whom were you speaking on the stony ground? I heard nobody responding to you. He (the Holy Prophet) said: It was Gabriel who met me by the side of the stony ground and said: Give glad tidings to your Ummah that he who died without associating ought with Allah would go into Paradise. I said: Gabriel, even if he committed theft and fornication? He said: Yes. I said: Even it he committed theft and fornication? He said: Yes, I again said: Even if he committed theft and fornication? He said: Yes, even if he drank wine.
992.01 | Ahnaf b. Qais reported:I came to Medina and when I was in the company of the grandees of Quraish a man with a crude body and an uncouth face wearing coarse clothes came there. He stood up before them and said: Give glad tidings to those whom who amass riches of the stones which would be heated in the Fire of Hell, and would be placed at the tick of the chest till it would project from the shoulder bone and would he put on the shoulder bone till it would project from the tick of his chest, and it (this stone) would continue passing and repassing (from one side to the other). He (the narrator) said: Then people hung their heads and I saw none among them giving any answer. He then returned and I followed him till he sat near a pillar. I said: I find that these (people) disliked what you said to them and they do not understand anything. My friend Abu'l-Qasim (Muhammad) (may peace he upon him) called me and I responded to him, and he said: Do you see Uhud? I saw the sun (shining) on me and I thought that he would send me on an errand for him. So I said: I see it. Upon this he said: Nothing would delight me more than this that I should have gold like it (equal to the bulk of Uhud), and I should spend it all except three dinars. (How sad it is) that they hoard worldly riches, and they know nothing. I said: What about you and your brothers Quraish? You do not go to thein for any need and do not accept anything from them. He said: By Allah, I neither beg anything from them (from worldly goods), nor do I ask them anything about religion till I meet my Allah and His Messenger.
992.02 | Ahnaf b. Qais reported:While I was in the company of the (elites) of Quraiah, Abu Dharr came there and he was saying: Give glad tidings to the hoarders of riches that their backs would be branded (so deeply) that (the hot Iron) would come out of their sides, and when the backs of their necks would be branded, it would come out of their foreheads. He (Abu Dharr) then went away and sat down. I asked who he was. They said: He is Abu Dharr. I went to him and said to him: What is this that I heard from you which you were saying before? He said: I said nothing but only that which I heard from their Prophet (ﷺ). I again said: What do you say about this gift? He said: Take it, for today it is a help. But when it becomes a price for your religion, then abandon it.
993.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying that Allah, the Most Blessed and High, said:O son of Adam, spend. I will spend on you. The right hand of Allah is full and overflowing and in nothing would diminish it, by overspending day and night.
993.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying that Allah said to him:" Spend, I will bestow upon you." And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The right hand of Allah is full and spending (the riches) liberally during day and night will not diminish (the resources of Allah). Don't you see what (an enormous amount of resources) He has spent since He created the heaven and the earth, and what is in His right hand has not decreased? His Throne is upon the water. And in His other hand is death, and He elevates and degrades (whom He likes).
994 | Thauban reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The most excellent dinar is one that a person spends on his family, and the dinar which he spends on his animal in Allah's path, and the dinar he spends on his companions in Allah's path. Abu Qilaba (one of the narrators) said: He (the narrator) started with family, and then Abu Qilaba said: Who is the person with greater reward than a person who spends on young members of his family (and thus) preserves (saves them from want) (and by virtue of which) Allah brings profit for them and makes them rich.
995 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Of the dinar you spend as a contribution in Allah's path, or to set free a slave, or as a sadaqa given to a needy, or to support your family, the one yielding the greatest reward is that which you spent on your family.
996 | Khaithama reported:While we were sitting in the company of 'Abdullah b. 'Umar there came in his steward. He (Ibn 'Umar) said: Have you supplied the provision to the slaves? He said: No. Upon this he said: Go and give (the provision) to them, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has said: This sin is enough for a man that he withholds the subsistence from one whose master he is.
997.01 | Jabir reported:A person from the Banu 'Udhra set a slave free after his death. This news reached the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon hhn). Upon this he said: Have you any property besides it? He said: No. Upon this he said: Who would buy (this slave) from me? Nulaim b. Abdullah bought it for eight hundred dirhams and (this amount was) brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who returned it to him (the owner), and then said: Start with your own self and spend it on yourself, and if anything is left, it should be spent on your family, and if anything is left (after meeting the needs of the family) it should be spent on relatives, and if anything is left from the family, it should be spent like this, like this. And he was saying: In front of you, on your right and on your left.
997.02 | Jabir reported that a person among the Ansar who was called Abu Madhkur granted posthumous freedom to his slave who was called Ya'qub. The rest of the hadith is the same.
998.01 | Anas b. Malik is reported as saying:Abu Talha was the one among the Ansar of Medina who possessed the largest property and among his property he valued most was his garden known as Bairaha' which was opposite the mosque, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) often visited it and he drank of its sweet water. When this verse was revealed: "You will never attain righteousness till you give freely of what you love" (iii. 91), Abu Talha got up and, going to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), said: Allah says in His Book: "You will never attain righteousness till you give freely of what you love," and the dearest of my property is Bairaha' so I give it as Sadaqa to God from Whom I hope for reward for it and the treasure with Allah; so spend it, Messenger of Allah, on whatever purpose you deem it proper. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Well done! that is a profitable deal, that is a profitable deal. I have heard what you have said, but I think you should spend it on your nearest relatives. So Abu Talha distributed it among the nearest relatives and his cousins on his father's side.
998.02 | Anas reported that when this verse was tevealed:" You will not attain righteousness till you give freely of what you love," Abu Talha said: I see that our Lord has demanded from us out of our property; so I make you a witness, Messenger of Allah. that I give my land known as Bairaha' for the sake of Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Give that to your relatives. So he gave it to Hassan b. Thabit and Ubayy b. Ka'b.
999 | Maimuna bint Harith reported that she set free a slave-girl during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and she made a mention of that to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said:Had you gives her to your maternal uncles, you would have a greater reward.
1000.01 | Zainab, the wife of 'Abdullah (b. Mas'ud ), reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:0 women, give sadaqa even though it be some of your jewellery. She returned to 'Abdullah and said: You are a person with empty hands, whereas the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has commanded us to give sadaqa, so better go to him and ask and if this will suffice for me; otherwise I shall give it to someone else. 'Abdullah said to me (his wife): You better go yourself. So I went and there was another woman of the Ansar at the door of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) having the same porpose as I had. Now Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was invested with awe (so we did not like to knock). Then Bilal came out and we said to him: Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and inform him that there are two women at the door asking him whether it will serve them to give sadaqa to their spouses and to orphans who are under their charge, but do not inform him who we are. Bilal went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him (what these women had instructed him to ask). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked him who these women were. He (Bilal) said: They are women from Ansar and Zainab. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Which of the Zainabs? He said: The wife of 'Abdullah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There are two rewards for them, the reward of kinship and the reward of Sadaqa.
1000.02 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Zainab the wife of 'Abdullah, and she said:I was in the mosque and the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) saw me and said: Give Sadaqa even though it is out of your jewellery. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1001.01 | Umm Salama said:I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) whether there is a reward for me if I spend on Abu Salama's sons, and I am not going to abandon them in this state (of helplessness) for they are my sons. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. For you is the reward for what you spend on them.

1003.01 | Asma' daughter of Abu Bakr reported:I said: Messenger of Allah, my mother, who is inclined or scared has come to me. Should I (even An her position of being opposed to Islam) treat her well? He said: Yes.
1003.02 | Asma' bint Abu Bakr reported:My mother who was a polytheist came to me when he (the Holy Prophet) entered into treaty with, the Quraish (of Mecca). I inquired from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: Messenger of Allah, there has come to me my mother and she is inclined; should I (in this state of her mind) show her kindness? He said: Yes, treat her kindly.
1004.01 | 'A'isha said that a person came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said:My mother died suddenly without having made any will. I think she would have definitely given Sadaqa if she had been able to speak. Would she have a reward if I gave Sadaqa on her behalf? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes.
1004.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Hisham with the same chain of transmitters. And in the hadith transmitted by Abu Usama the words are:" She did not make any will," as it has been reported by Ibn Bishr, but it was not reported by the rest of the narrators.
1005 | Hudhaifa and Abu Shaiba reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Every act of goodness is sadaqa.
1006 | Abu Dharr reported:some of the people from among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: Messenger of Allah, the rich have taken away (all the) reward. They observe prayer as we do; they keep the fasts as we keep, and they give Sadaqa out of their surplus riches. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Has Allah not prescribed for you (a course) by following which you can (also) do sadaqa? In every declaration of the glorification of Allah (i. e. saying Subhan Allah) there is a Sadaqa, and every Takbir (i. e. saying Allah-O-Akbar) is a sadaqa, and every praise of His (saying al-Hamdu Lillah) is a Sadaqa and every declaration that He is One (La illha ill-Allah) is a sadaqa, and enjoining of good is a sadaqa, and forbidding of that which is evil is a Sadaqa, and in man's sexual Intercourse (with his wife, ) there is a Sadaqa. They (the Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, is there reward for him who satisfies his sexual passion among us? He said: Tell me, if he were to devote it to something forbidden, would it not be a sin on his part? Similarly, if he were to devote it to something lawful, he should have a reward.
1007.01 | 'A'isha reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Every one of the children of Adam has been created with three hundred and sixty joints; so he who declares the Glory of Allah, praises Allah, declares Allah to be One, Glorifies Allah, and seeks forgiveness from Allah, and removes stone, or thorn, or bone from people's path, and enjoins what is good and forbids from evil, to the number of those three hundred and sixty joints, will walk that day having saved himself from the Fire. Abu Taubah said: "Perhaps he said: 'Will reach the evening.'"
1007.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zaid with the same chain of transmitters except with (a slight) change of words (i.e. he [the Holy Prophet]) said:Or he enjoined what is good, ... and said: He enters the evening [i.e. he walks till evening].
1007.03 | This hadith has been narrated by 'A'isha through anothr chain of transmitters in which she reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:" Every man is created" ; the rest of the hadith is the same and he said:" He walks on that day."
1008.01 | Sa'id b. Abu Burda reported on the authority of his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Giving of Sadaqa is essential for every Muslim. It was said (to him): What do you say of him who does not find (the means) to do so? He said: Let him work with both his hands, thus doing benefit to himself and give Sadaqa. It was said to him: What about him who does not have (the means) to do so? He said: Then let him assist the needy, the aggrieved. It was said: What do you say of one who cannot even do this? He said: Then he should enjoin what is reputable or what is good. He said: What about him if he cannot do that? He (the Holy Prophet) said: He should then abstain from evil, for verify that is Sadaqa on his behalf.
1008.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters.
1009 | Hammam b. Munabbih reported that-this is out of (those ahadith) which Abu Huraira narrated to us from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). And he while making a mention of ahadith reported from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said this:Sadaqa is due on every joint of a person, every day the sun rises. Administering of justice between two men is also a Sadaqa. And assisting a man to ride upon his beast, or helping him load his luggage upon it, is a Sadaqa; and a good word is a Sadaqa; and every step that you take towards prayer is a Sadaqa, and removing of harmful things from the pathway is a Sadaqa.
1010 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:There is never a day wherein servants (of God) get up at morn, but are not visited by two angels. One of them says: 0 Allah, give him more who spends (for the sake of Allah), and the other says: 0 Allah, bring destruction to one who withholds.
1011 | Haritha b. Wahb reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Give Sadaqa for a time is about to come when a person would walk with alms and the one whom it is to be given would say: Had you brought it yesterday, I would have accepted it. For the present I do not need it. (And the giver of Sadaqa) I would not find anyone to accept it.
1012 | Abu Musa reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:There would come a time for the people when a person would roam about with Sadaqa of gold, but he would find no one to accept it from him. And a man would be seen followed by forty women seeking refuge with him on account of the scarcity of males and abundance of females."
157.03 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying:The Last Hour will not come before wealth becomes abundant and overflowing, so much so that a man takes Zakat out of his property and cannot find anyone to accept it from him and till the land of Arabia reverts to meadows and rivers.
157.04 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The Last Hour will not come till wealth is abundant and overflowing, so much so that the owner of the property will think as to who will accept Sadaqa from him, and a person would be called to accept Sadaqa and he would say: I do not need it.
1013 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenaer (ﷺ) as saying:The earth will vomit long pieces of its liver like columns of gold and silver, and the murderer will come and say: It was for this that I committed murder. The breaker of family ties will come and say: It was for this that I broke the family ties; and the thief will come and say: It is for this that my hands were cut off. They will then leave it and will not take anything out of it.
1014.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone gives as Sadaqa the equivalent of a date from that (earning) earned honestly, for Allah accepts that which is lawful, the Lord would accept it with His Right Hand, and even if it is a date, it would foster in the Hand of the lord, as one of you fosters his colt, till it becomes bigger than a mountain.
1014.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:No one gives Sadaqa of a date out of his honest earning, but Allah accepts it with His Right Hand, and then fosters it as one of you fosters the colt or a young she-camel, till it becomes like a mountain or even greater.
1014.03 | This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters with a change of words. In the hadith transmitted Rauh (the words are):" Out of the honest earning and its spending at what is its (due) right" ; and in the hadith transmitted by Sulaiman (the words are):" And its spending at its proper place."
1014.04 | Narrated Abu Huraira:This hadith has been transmitted through another chain the same as the narration of Ya'qub from Suhail (# 2212).
1015 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:O people, Allah is Good and He therefore, accepts only that which is good. And Allah commanded the believers as He commanded the Messengers by saying: "O Messengers, eat of the good things, and do good deeds; verily I am aware of what you do" (xxiii. 51). And He said: "O those who believe, eat of the good things that We gave you" (ii. 172). He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair disheveled and covered with dust. He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): "O Lord, O Lord," whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?
1016.01 | 'Adi b. Hatim reported that he heard Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying:He who among you can protect himself against Fire, he should do so, even if it should be with half a date.
1016.02 | 'Adi b. Hatim reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Allah will speak with everyone amongst you without any interpreter between them. He (the man) would see towards his right and would not find anything but (the deeds) which he had done before, and he would see towards the left and would not find anything but (the deeds) which he had done before. He would see in front of him and would find nothing but Fire just before his face. So protect (yourselves) against Fire even if it is with the help of half a date. A hadith like this has been transmitted by Khaithama and addition has been made in this of (these words) ;" Even if it is with a good word."
1016.03 | 'Adi b. Hatim reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a mention of Fire. He turned his face aside and diverted his attention and then said:Guard (yourselves) against Fire. He turned his face and diverted his attention till we thought as if he were (actually seeing it and then said: Protect yourselves against Fire even if it is with half a date, and he who does not find it, (he should do so) with pleasant words. Abu Kuraib did not mention the word: (as if).
1016.04 | Adi b. Hatim reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a mention of the Fire and sought refuge (with Allah against it). He turned aside his face three times and then said:Protect yourselves against Fire even if with half a date. But if you fail to find it (then protect yourselves against Fire) with the help of a pleasant word).
1017.01 | Mundhir b. Jarir reported on the authority of his father:While we were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the early hours of the morning, some people came there (who) were barefooted, naked, wearing striped woollen clothes, or cloaks, with their swords hung (around their necks). Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The colour of the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce Adhan). He pronounced Adhan and Iqima, and he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer (along with his Companion) and then addressed (them reciting verses of the Holy Qur'an): '" 0 people, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single being" to the end of the verse," Allah is ever a Watcher over you" (iv. 1). (He then recited) a verse of Sura Hashr:" Fear Allah. and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the morrow and fear Allah" (lix. 18). (Then the audience began to vie with one another in giving charity.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some donated a sa' of wheat, some a sa' of dates; till he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date. Then a person from among the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously, till I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger (ﷺ) glistening, like gold (on account of joy). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam an evil precedent, there is upon him the burden of that, and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.
1017.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Mandhir through another chain of transmitters. And the hadith transmitted by Ibn Mu'adh contains an addition:" He then observed the noon prayer and then gave the sermon."
1017.03 | Mundhir b. Jarir narrated on the authority of his father:When we were sitting in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). There came people dressed in striped woollen clothes, and the rest of the hadith in the same, and there (it is also mentioned):" He observed the Zuhr prayer and then climbed up a small pulpit, praised Allah, lauded Him, and then said: Verily Allah in His Book has revealed: 'O people, fear your Lord, ' etc." (iv. 1).
1017.04 | Jarir b. 'Abdullah reported:People came to to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and they ware dressed in woollen clothes. He (the Holy Prophet) saw their dismal state, as they were suffering from want and the rest of the hadith is the same.
1018.01 | Abu Mas'ud reported:We were commanded to give charity (despite the fact.) that we were coolies. Abu 'Aqil donated half a sa'. And there came another man with more than this. The hypocrites said: Verily Allah does not stand in need of the charity of this, and the second one has done nothing but only made a show (of his charity). Then this verse was revealed." Those who scoff at the voluntary givers of charity among the believers as well as those who cannot find anything (to give) but with their hard labour" (ix. 80). And Bishr did not utter the word Muttawwi'in.
1018.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters and in the hadith transmitted by Sa'id b. al Rabi (the words are):" We used to carry loads on our backs."
1019 | It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira (that the Messenger of Allah) said:Of course the person who gives to the family a she-camel as a gift, which gives milk morning and evening equal to a large bowl, its reward (the reward of the gift) is great.
1020 | Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade (to do certain things) and then he made a mention of certain habits and said:He who gives a she-camel as a gift, for him is the reward (of the gift) both morning and evening - a reward for drinking milk in the morning and a reward for drinking milk in the evening.
1021.01 | Abu Haraira reported that the likeness of one who spends or one who gives charity is that of a person who has two cloaks or two coats-of-mail over him right from the breast to the collar bones. And when the spender (and the other narrator said, when the giver of charity) makes up his mind to give charity, it (coat-mail) becomes expanded for him. But when a miserly person intends to spend, it contracts and every ring grips the place where it is. For the giver of charity, this coat-of. mail expands to cover his whole body and obliterates even his footprints. Abu Huraira said:(The miserly man) tries to expand it (the coat-of-mail) but it does not expand.
1021.02 | Abu Haraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave similitudes of a miserly man and the giver of charity as two persons who have two coats-of-mail over them with their hands pressed closely to their breasts and their collar bones. Whenever the giver of charity gives charity it (the coat-of mail) expands so much as to cover his finger tips and obliterate his foot prints. And whenever the miserly person intends to give charity (the coat-of-mail) contracts and every ring grips the place where it is. He (Abu Huraira) said:I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying with fingers in the opening of his shirt:" If you had seen him trying to expand it, it will not expand."
1021.03 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:. The similitude of a miserly man and the giver of charity is that of two persons with coats of mail over them; when the giver of charity intends to give charity, it expands over him (to much so) that the footprints are also obliterated. And when the miserly man intends to give charity, it contracts over him, and his hands are tied up to his collar bone, and every ring is fixed up to another. He (the narrator) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: He would try to expand it. but he would not be able to do so.
1022 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:A man expressed his intention to give charity, so he came out with charity and placed it in the hand of an adulteress. In the morning, the people were talking and saying: charity was given to an adulteress last night. He (the giver of Sadaqa) said: 0 Allah, to Thee be the praise-to an adulteress. He then again expressed his intention to give charity; so he went out with the charity and placed it in the hand of a rich person. In the morning the people were talking and saying: Charity was given to a rich person. He (the giver of charity) said: 0 Allah, to Thee be the praise-to a well-to-do person. He then expressed his intention to give charity, so he went out with charity and placed it in the hand of a thief. In the morning, the people were talking and saying: Charity was given to a thief. So (one of the persons) said: 0 Allah, to Thee be the praise (what a misfortune it is that charity has been given to) the adulteress, to a rich person. to a thief! There came (the angel to him) and he was told: Your charity has been accepted. As for the adulteress (the charity might become the means) whereby she might restrain herself from fornication. The rich man might perhaps learn a lesson and spend from what Allah has given him, and the thief might thereby refrain from committing theft.
1023 | Abu Musa reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:The honest Muslim trustee who spends (sometimes he said" who gives" ) what he is commanded to do and he gives that in full with his heart overflowing with cheerfulness and he gives it to one to whom he is ordered, he is one of the givers of charity.
1024.01 | 'A'isha reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:When a woman gives in charity some of the food in her house, without causing any damage, there is reward for her for whatever she has given, and a reward for her husband for what he earned. The same applies to the trustee. In no respect does the one diminish the reward of the other.
1024.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Mansur with the same chain of transmitters (with this alteration of words):" from the food of her husband".
1024.03 | 'A'isha reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:When a woman spends (something as Sadaqa) out of the household of her husband without causing any damage, there is a reward for her and for him too like it for whatever he earned, and for her (for the wife) because of her spending (for the sake of Allah), and for the trustee also (there is a reward like it), without any reduction from their rewards.
1024.04 | This hadith has been narrated by A'mash with the same chain of transmitters.
1025.01 | Umair, the freed slave of Abi'l-Lahm reported:I was the slave (of Abi'l-Lahm). I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) if I could give some charity out of my master's wealth. He said: Yes, and the reward is half and half between you two.
1025.02 | 'Umair, the freed slave of Abi'l-Lahm, said:My master commanded me to cut some meat in strips; (as I was doing it) a poor man came to me and I gave him some of it to eat. My master came to know of that, and he beat me. I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and narrated it to him. He (the Holy Prophet) summoned him and said: Why did you beat him? He (Abi'l-Lahm) said: He gives away my food without being commanded to do so. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: The reward would be shared by you two.
1026 | Hammam b. Munabbih said:These are some of the a hadith of Muhammad. the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), transmitted to us on the authority of Abu Huraira. So he narrated one hadith out of them (as this): The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No woman should observe fast when her spouse is present (in the house) but with his permission. And she should not admit any (mahram) in his house, while he (her husband) is present, but with his permission. And whatever she spends from his earnings without his sanction, for him is half the reward.
1027.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone contributes a pair of anything for the sake of Allah, he would be invited to enter Paradise (with these words): O servant of Allah, it is good (for you). Those who engage in prayer will he invited to enter by the gate of prayer; those who take part in Jihad will be invited to enter by the gate of Jihad; those who give charity will be invited to enter by the gate of charity; and those who observe fast will be invited to enter by the gate ar-Rayyan. Abu Bakr Siddiq said: Messenger of Allah, is it necessary that a person be invited through one of these gates? Will anyone be invited to enter by all those gates? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Yes, and I hope you will be one of them.
1027.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Zuhri through another chain of transmitters.
1027.03 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:He who spent pairs for the sake of Allah, the guardians of Paradise would call him, (in fact) every guardian of the door (of Paradise would welcome him saying): O, so and so, come on. Upon this Abu Bakr said: Messenger of Allah, (it means) there would be no distress on this person. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said. I hope you would be among them.
1028 | Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Who fasted among you today? Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) replied: I did. He (the Prophet again) said: Who among you followed a bier today? Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) replied: I did. He (the Prophet again) said: Who among you fed a poor man today? Abu Bakr (Allah he pleased with him) replied: I did. He (again) said: Who among you visited an invalid today? Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) said: I did. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Anyone in whom (these good deeds) are combined will certainly enter paradise.
1029.01 | Asma', daughter of Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him), reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Spend, and do not calculate, or otherwise Allah would also calculate in your case.
1029.02 | Asma' reported Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying (to her):Spend and do not calculate, (for) Allah would calculate in your case; and do not hoard, otherwise Allah would be withholding from you.
1029.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Asma' through another chain of transmitters.
1029.04 | Asma', daughter of Abu Bakr, reported that abe came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) and said:Apostle of Allah, I have nothing with me, but only, that which is given to me by Zubair (for household expenses). Is there any sin for me if I spend out of that which is given to me (by Zabair)? Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Spend according to your means; and do not hoard, for Allah will withhold from you.

Upon this he said: That you should give charity (in a state when you are) healthy and close-fisted, one haunted by the fear of poverty, hoping to become rich (charity in such a state of health and mind is the best). And you must not defer (charity to such a length) that you are about to die and would he saying: This is for so and so, and this is for so and so. Lo, it has already come into (the possession of so and so).
1032.02 | Abu Huraira reported that a person came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said:Messenger of Allah, which charity is the greatest in reward? (The Prophet said): By your father, beware, you should give charity (in a state when you are) healthy and close-fisted, haunted by the fear of poverty, and still hoping to live (as rich). And you must not defer charity (to the time) when you are about to die, and would then say:" This is for so and so, and this for so and so." It has already become the possession of so and so.

1035 | Hakim b. Hizam reported:I begged the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he gave me. I again begged, he again gave me. I again begged, he again gave me, and then said: This property is green and sweet; he who receives it with a cheerful heart is blessed in it, and he who receives it with an avaricious mind would not be blessed in it, he being like one who eats without being satished, and the upper hand is better thad the lower hand.
1036 | Abu Umama reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:O son of Adam, it is better for you if you spend your surplus (wealth), but if you withhold it, it is evil for you.

1037.01 | Mu'awiya said:Be cautious about ahadith except those which were current during the reign of Umar, for he exhorted people to fear Allah, the Exalted and mMajestic. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: He upon whom Allah intends to bestow goodness, He confers upon him an insight in religion; and I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: I am the treasurer. To one whom I give out of (my own) sweet will, he would be blessed in that, but he whom I give (yielding to) his constant begging and for his covetousness is like one who would eat, but would not be satisfied.
1038.01 | Mu'awiya reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Do not press in a matter, for I swear by Allah, none of you who asks me for anything and manages to get his request while I disdain it, will he be blessed in that which I give him.

1037.02 | Abd al-Rahman b. Auf reported:I heard Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan saying in an address that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: He to whom Allah intends to do good, He gives him insight into religion. And I am only the distributor while Allah is the Bestower.
1039.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The poor man (miskin) is not the one who goes round to the people and is dismissed with one or two morsels. and one or two dates. They (the Prophet's Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, then who is miskin? He said: He who does not get enough to satisfy him, and he is not considered so (as to elicit the attention of the benevolent people), so that charity way be given to him. and he does not beg anything from people.
1039.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Miskin is not he who is dismissed with one or two dates, and with one morsel or two morsels. (In fact) miskin is he who abstains (from begging). Read if you so desire (the verse):" They beg not of men importunately)" (ii. 273).

1040.01 | Hamza. son of 'Abdullah, reported on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:When a man is always begging from people. he would meet Allah (in a state) that there would be no flesh on his face.

1042.01 | Abu Huraira is reported to have heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:It is better for one among you to bring a load of firewood on his back and give charity out of it (and satisfy his own need) and be independent of people, than that he should beg from people, whether they give him anything or refuse him. Verily the upper hand is better than the lower hand, and begin (charity) with your dependents.
1042.02 | Qais b. Abu Hizam reported:We came to Abu Huraira and he told Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said this: By Allah, (it is better) that one among you should go and bring a load of firewood on his back and he should sell it, and the rest of the hadith was narrated (like the previous one).
1042.03 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:It is better for any one of you to tie a bundle of firewood and carry it on his back and sell it than to beg a person, he may give or may refuse.
1043 | Malik al-Ashja'i reported:We, nine, eight or seven men, were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: Why don't you pledge allegiance to the Messenger of Allah? -while we had recently pledged allegiance. So we said: Messenger of Allah, we have already pledged allegiance to you. He again said: Why don't you pledge allegiance to the Messenger of Allah? And we said: Messenger of Allah, we have already pledged allegiance to you. He again said: Why don't you pledge allegiance to the Messenger of Allah? We stretched our hands and said: Messenger of Allah. we have already pledged allegiance to you. Now tell (on what things) should we pledge allegiance to you. He said I (You must pledge allegiance) that you would worship Allah only and would not associate with Him anything, (and observe) five prayers, and obey- (and he said onething in an undertone) -that you would not beg people of anything. (And as a consequence of that) I saw that some of these people did not ask anyone to pick up the whip for them if it fell down.
1044 | Qabisa b. Mukhariq al-Hilali said:I was under debt and I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and begged from him regarding it. He said: Wait till we receive Sadaqa, so that we order that to be given to you. He again said: Qabisa, begging is not permissible but for one of the three (classes) of persons: one who has incurred debt, for him begging is permissible till he pays that off, after which he must stop it; a man whose property has been destroyed by a calamity which has smitten him, for him begging is permissible till he gets what will support life, or will provide him reasonable subsistence; and a person who has been smitten by poverty. the genuineness of which is confirmed by three intelligent members of this peoples for him begging is permissible till he gets what will support him, or will provide him subsistence. Qabisa, besides these three (every other reason) for begging is forbidden, and one who engages in such consumes that what is forbidden.
1045.01 | Salim b. Abdullah b. 'Umar reported on the authority of his father ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) that he had heard 'Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) saying:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave me a gift, but I said: Give it to one who needs it more than I. He gave me wealth for the second time but I said: Give it to one who needs it more than I. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Take out of this wealth which comes to you without your being avaricious and without begging, but in other circumstance's do not let your heart hanker after it.
1045.02 | Salim b. 'Abdullah reported on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave to 'Umar b. Khattab some gift. Umar said to him:Messenger of Allah, give it to one who needs it more than I. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Take it; either keep it with you or give it as a charity, and whatever comes to you in the form of this type of wealth, without your being avaricious or begging for it, accept it, but in other circumstances do not let your heart hanker after it. And it was on account of this that Ibn 'Umar never begged anything from anyone, nor refused anything given to him.
1045.03 | This hadith has been narrated by Abdullah b. al-Sa'di from 'Umar b. al-Khattab who heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
1045.04 | Ibn al-Sa'di Maliki reported:'Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) appointed me as a collector of Sadaqa. When I had finished that (the task assigned to me) and I handed over that to him (to 'Umar), he commanded me to (accept) some remuneration (for the work). I said: I performed this duty for Allah and my reward is with Allah. He said: Take whatever has been given to you, for I also performed this duty during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He assigned me the task of a collector and I said as you say, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: When you are given anything without your begging for it, (then accept it), eat it and give it in charity.
1045.05 | Ibn al-Sa'di reported:'Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) appointed me as a collector of Sadaqat. The rest of the hadith in the same.
1046.01 | Abu Huraira reported from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as having said this:The heart of an old person feels young for the love of two things: love for long life and wealth.
1046.02 | Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said this:The heart of an old person is young for two things: for long life and love for wealth.
1047.01 | Anas reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The son of Adam grows old, but two (desires) in him remain young: desire for wealth and desire for life.
1047.02 | A hadith like this has been narrated by Anas through another chain of transmitters.
1047.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Anas through another chain of transmitters.
1048.01 | Anas reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If the son of Adam were to possess two valleys of riches. he would long for the third one. And the stomach of the son of Adam is not filled but with dust. And Allah returns to him who repents.
1048.02 | Anas b. Malik reported:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying this, but I do not know whether this thing was revealed to him or not, but he said to.
1048.03 | Anas b. Malik reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If there were two valleys of gold for the son of Adam, he would long for another one. and his mouth will not be filled but with dust, and Allah returns to him who repents.
1049 | Ibn Abbas reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If there were for the son of Adam a valley full of riches, he would long to possess another one like it. and Ibn Adam does not feel satiated but with dust. And Allah returns to him who returns (to Him). Ibn Abbas said: I do not know whether it is from the Qur'an or not; and in the narration transmitted by Zuhair it was said: I do not know whether it is from the Qur'an, and he made no mention of Ibn Abbas.
1050 | Abu Harb b. Abu al-Aswad reported on the authority of his father that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari sent for the reciters of Basra. They came to him and they were three hundred in number. They recited the Qur'an and he said:You are the best among the inhabitants of Basra, for you are the reciters among them. So continue to recite it. (But bear in mind) that your reciting for a long time may not harden your hearts as were hardened the hearts of those before you. We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara'at. I have, however, forgotten it with the exception of this which I remember out of it:" If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust." And we used so recite a surah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and I have forgotten it, but remember (this much) out of it:" Oh people who believe, why do you say that which you do not practise" (lxi 2.) and" that is recorded in your necks as a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection" (xvii. 13).
1051 | Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said:Richness does not lie in the abundance of (worldly) goods but richness is the richness of the soul (heart, self).
1052.01 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and addressed the people thus:O people, by Allah, I do not entertain fear about you in regard to anything else than that which Allah would bring forth for you in the form of adornment of the world. A person said: Messenger of Allah, does good produce evil? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent for a while and he then said: What did you say? He replied: Messenger of Allah, I said: Does good produce evil? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: The good does not produce but good. but among the plants the spring rain produces There some which kill with a tremour or nearly kill all but the animal which feeds on vegetation. It eats and when its flanks are distended, it faces the can. then when it has donged or urinated and chewed it returns and eats. He who accepts wealth rightly, Allah confers blessing on it for him. and he who takes wealth without any right, he is like one who eats and is not satisfied.
1052.02 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said:The most dreadful thing I fear in your case is what Allah brings forth for you in the form of the adornment of the world. They (the Prophet's Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, what is the adornment of the world? He said: Blessings (the natural resources) of the earth. They (again) said: Messenger of Allah, does good produce evil? He said: No, only good comes out of good. No, only good comes out of good. No. only good comes out of good. All that which the spring rain helps to grow kills or is about to kill but (the animal) which feeds on vegetation. It eats and when its flanks are distended, it faces the sun, it chews the cud, it has dunged and urinated. it returns and eats. This wealth is green and sweet, and he who accepts it and applies it rightly, finds it a good help, but he who takes it wrongfully is like one who eats without being satisfied.
1052.03 | Abu Said al-Khudri reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting on the pulpit and we were sitting around him, and he said: What I am afraid of in regard to you after my death is that there would be opened for you the adornments of the world and its beauties. A person said: Messenger of Allah, does good produce evil? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent. And it was said to him (the man who had asked the question from the Holy Prophet): What Is the matter with you, that you speak with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) but he does not speak with you? We thought as if revelation was descending upon him. He regained himself and wiped the sweat from him and said: He was the inquirer (and his style of expression showed as if he praised him and then added): Verily good does not produce evil. Whatever the spring rainfall causes to grow kills or is about to kill, but that (animal) which feeds on vegetation. It eats till its flanks are filled; it faces the sun and dungs and urinates. and then returns to eat. And this Wealth is a sweet vegetation, and it is a good companion for a Muslim who gives out of it to the needy, to the orphan. to the wayfarer, or something like that as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who takes it without his right is like one who eats but does not feel satisfied, and it would stand witness against him on the Day of judgment.
1053.01 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that some people from among the Ansar begged from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he gave them. They again begged him and he again gave them, till when what was in his possession was exhausted he said:Whatever good (riches, goods) I have, I will not withhold it from you. He who refrains from begging Allah safeguards him against want. and he who seeks sufficiency, Allah would keep him in a state of sufficiency, and he who shows endurance. Allah would grant him power to endure, and none is blessed with an endowment better and greater than endurance.
1053.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.
1054 | 'Amr b. al-'As reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:He Is successful who has accepted Islam, who has been provided with sufficient for his want and been made contented by Allah with what He has given him.
1055 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:O Allah, make the provision of Muhammad's family sufficient just to sustain life.
1056 | Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) distributed something. Upon this I said:Messenger of Allah, I swear by God, the others besides them were more deserving than these (to whom you gave charity). He said: They had in fact left no other alternative for me. but (that they should) either beg importunately from me or they would regard me as a miser, but I am not a miser.
1057.01 | Anas b. Malik reported:I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he had put on a mantle of Najran with a thick border. A bedouin met him and pulled the mantle so violently that I saw this violent pulling leaving marks of the border of the mantle on the skin of the neck of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). And he (the bedouin) said: Muhammad, issue command that I should be given out of the wealth of Allah which is at your disposal. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned his attention to him and smiled, and then ordered for him a gift (provision).
1057.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik through another chain of transmitters. And In the hadith transmitted by Ikrima b. 'Ammir there is an addition:" He (the bedouin) pulled his (mantle) so violently that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was drifted very close to the bedouin." And in the hadith transmitted by Hammam, (the words are):" He pulled it so violently that the mantle was torn and the border was left around the neck of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)."
1058.01 | Miswar b. Makhrama reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) distributed some cloaks but did not bestow one upon Makhrama. Upon this Makhrama said:O my son, come along with me to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So I went with him. He said: Enter the house and call him (to come out) for me. So I called him and he (the Holy Prophet) came out, and there was a cloak (from those already distributed) on him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I had kept it for you. He (Makhrama), looked at it and was pleased.
1058.02 | Miswar b. Makhrama reported:Some cloaks were presented to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). My father Makhrama said to me: Come along with me to him; perhaps we may be able to get anything out of that (stock of cloaks). My father stood at the door and began to talk. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) recognised him by his voice and came out and there was a cloak with him, and he was showing its beauties and saying: I kept it for you, I kept it for you.
150.05 | Sa'd reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bestowed (some gifts) upon a group of people and I was sitting amongst them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), however, left a person and he did not give him anything. and he seemed to me the most excellent among them (and thus deserved the gifts more than anyone else). So I stood up before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said to him in undertone:Messenger of Allah, what about so and so? By Allah, I find him a believer. He (the Messenger of Allah) said: He may be a Muslim. I kept quiet for a short while, and then what I knew of him urged me (to plead his case again) and I said: Messenger of Allah, what about so and so? By Allah, I find him a believer. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: He may be a Muslim. I again remained quiet for a short while, and what I knew of him again urged me (to plead his case so I) said: Messenger of Allah, what about so and so? By Allah, I find him a believer. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: He may be a Muslim. I often bestow (something) upon a person, whereas someone else is dearer to me than he, because of the fear that he may fall headlong into the fire. And in the hadith transmitted by Hulwani this statement was repeated twice.
150.06 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.
150.07 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Muhammad b. Sa'd through another chain of transmitters (and the words are):" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) struck between my neck and shoulder with his hand and said: Do you wrangle, O Sa'd, because I bestow (some gifts) upon a person?"
1059.01 | Anas b. Malik reported that when on the Day of Hunain Allah conferred upon His Apostle (ﷺ) the riches of Hawazin (without armed encounter), the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set about distributing to some persons of Quraish one hundred camels Upon this they (the young people from the Ansar) said:May Allah grant pardon to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that he bestowed (these camels) upon the people of Quraish, and he ignored us, whereas our swords are still dripping blood. Anas b. Malik said: Their statement was conveyed to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he sent (someone) to the Ansar and gathered them under a tent of leather. When they had assembled, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to them and said: What is this news that has reached me from you? The wise people of the Ansar said: Messenger of Allah, so far as the sagacious amongst us are concerned they have said nothing, but we have amongst us persons of immature age; they said: May Allah grant pardon to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that he gave to the Quraish and ignored us (despite the fact) that our swords are besmeared with their blood. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I give (at times material gifts) to persons who were quite recently in the state of unbelief, so that I may incline them to truth Don't you feel delighted that people should go with riches, and you should go back to your places with the Messenger of Allah? By Allah, that with which you would return is better than that with which they would return. They said: Yes, Messenger of Allah, we are pleased. The Prophet said too: You would find marked preference (in conferring of the material gifts) in future, so you should show patience till you meet Allah and His Messenger and I would he at the Haud Kauthar. They said: We would show patience.
1059.02 | Anas b. Malik reported that when Allah conferred upon His Messenger (ﷺ) the riches of Hawazin (without armed encounter) ; the rest of the hadith is the same except some variation (of words):" Anas said: We could not tolerate it and he also said: The people were immature in age."
1059.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik through another chain of transmitters.
1059.04 | Anas b. Malik reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gathered the Ansar and said:Is there someone alien among you? They said: No, but only the son of our sister. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The son of the sister of the people is included among the tribe, and (farther) said: The Quraish have recently abandoned Jahillyya and have just been delivered from distress; I, therefore, intend to help them and conciliate them. Don't you feel happy that the people should return with worldly riches and you return with the Messenger of Allah to your houses? (So far as my love for you is concerned I should say) if the people were to tread a valley and the Ansar tread a narraw path (in a mountain) I would tread the narrow path of the Ansar.
1059.05 | Anas b. Malik reported:When Mecca was conquered, he (the Holy Prophet) distributed the spoils among the Quraish. Upon this the Ansar said: It is strange that our swords are dripping with their blood, whereas our spoils have been given to them (to the Quraish). This (remark) reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and so he gathered them and said: What is this that has been conveyed to me about you? They said: (Yes) it is that very thing that, has reached you and they were not (the people) to speak a lie. Upon this he said: Don't you like that the people should return to their houses along with worldly riches, whereas you should return to your houses with the Messenger of Allah? If the people were to tread a valley or a narrow path, and the Ansar were also to tread a valley or a narrow path, I would tread the valley (along with the) Ansar or the narrow path (along with the) Ansar.
1059.06 | Anas b. Malik reported that when it was the Day of Hunain there came the tribes of Hawazin, Ghatafan and others along with their children and animals, and there were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that day ten thousand (soldiers), and newly freed men (of Mecca after its conquest). All these men (once) turned their backs, till he (the Holy Prophet) was left alone. He (the Messenger of Allah) on that day called twice and he did not interpose anything between these two (announcements). He turned towards his right and said:O people of Ansar! They said: At thy beck and call (are we), Messenger of Allah. Be glad we are with thee. He then turned towards his left and said: O people of Ansar. They said: At thy beck and call (are we). Be glad we are with thee. He (the Holy Prophet) was riding a white mule. He dismounted and said: I am the servant of Allah and His Apostle. The polytheists suffered defeat and the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) acquired a large quantity of spoils, and he distributed them among the refugees and the people recently delivered (of Mecca) but did not give anything to the Ansar. The Ansar said: In the hour of distress it is we who are called (for help). but the spoils are given to other people besides us. This (remark) reached him (the Holy Prophet). and he gathered them In a tent. and said: What is this news that has reached me on your behalf? They kept silence. Upon this he said: O people of Ansar, don't you like that people should go away with worldly (riches), and you go away with Muhammad taking him to your houses? They said: Yes, happy we are. Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: If the people were to tread a valley, and the Ansar were to tread a narrow path, I would take the narrow path of the Ansar. Hisham said: I asked Abu Hamza if he was present there. He said: How could I be absent from him?
1059.07 | Anas b. Malik reported:We conquered Mecca and then we went on an expedition to Hunain. The polytheists came, forming themselves into the best rows that I have seen. They first formed the rows of cavalry, then those of infantry, and then those of women behind them. Then there were formed the rows of sheep and goats and then of other animals. We were also people large in number, and our (number) had reached six thousand. And on one side Khalid b. Walid was in charge of the cavalry. And our horses at once turned back from our rear. And we could hardly hold our own when our horses were exposed, and the bedouins and the people whom we knew took to their heels. (Seeing this) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called thus: O emigrants, O emigrants. He then. said: O Ansar, O Ansar. (Anas said: This hadith is transmitted by a group of eminent persons.) We said: At thy beck and call are we, Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then advanced and he (Anas) said: By Allah, we had not yet reached them when Allah defeated them. and we took possession of the wealth and we then marched towards Ta'if, and we besieged them for forty nights. and then came back to Mecca and encamped (at a place), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to bestow a hundred camels upon each individual. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1060.01 | Rafi' b. Khadij reported that the Messenger of Allah; (ﷺ) gave to Abu Sufyan b. Harb and Safwan. b. Umayya and 'Uyaina b. Hisn and Aqra' b. Habis, i.e. to every one of these persons, one hundred camels, and gave to 'Abbas b. Mirdas less than this number. Upon this 'Abbas b. Mirdis said:You allot the share of my booty and that of my horse between 'Uyaina and Aqra'. Both Uyaina and Aqra' are in no way more eminent than Mirdas (my father) in the assembly. I am in no way inferior to any one of these persons. And he who is let down today would not be elevated. He (the narrator) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then completed one hundred camels for him.
1060.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Sa'id b. Masruq with the same chain of transmitters (with the words):" The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) distributed the spoils of Hunain, and he (the Holy Prophet) gave one hundred camels to Abu Sufyan b. Harb. The rest of the hadith is the same, but with this addition:" He bestowed upon" Alqama b. 'Ulatha one hundred (camels)."
1060.03 | This hadith has been narrated by Sa'id with the same chain of transmitters, but no mention has been made of Alqama b. 'Ulatha, nor of safwin b. Umayya, and he did not mention the verse in his hadith.
1061 | Abdullah b. Zaid reported that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) conquered Hunain he distributed the booty, and he bestowed upon those whose hearts it was intended to win. It was conveyed to him (the Holy Prophet) that the Ansar cherished a desire that they should be given (that very portion) which the people (of Quraish) had got. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and, after having praised Allah and lauded Him, addressed them thus:O people of Ansar, did I not find you erring and Allah guided you aright through me, and (in the state of) being destitute and Allah made you free from want through me, and in a state of disunity and Allah united you through me, and they (the Ansar) said: Allah and His Messenger are most benevolent. He (again) said: Why do you not answer me? They said: Allah and His Messenger are the most benevolent. He said, If you wish you should say so and so, and the event (should take) such and such course (and in this connection he made a mention) of so many things. 'Amr is under the impression that he has not been able to remember them. He (the Holy Prophet) further said: Don't you feel happy (over this state of affairs) that the people should go away with goats and camels, and you go to your places along with the Messenger of Allah? The Ansar are inner garments (more close to me) and (other) people are outer garments. Had there not been migration, I would have been a man from among the Ansar. If the people were to tread a valley or a narrow path, I would tread the valley (chosen) by the Ansar or narrow path (trodden) by them. And you would soon find after me preferences (over you in getting material benefits). So you should show patience till you meet me at the Haud (Kauthar).
1062.01 | Abdullah reported:On the day of Hunain, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) showed preference (to some) people in the distribution of the spoils. He bestowed on Aqra' b. Habis one hundred camels, and bestowed an equal (number) upon 'Uyaina, and bestowed on people among the elites of Arabia, and preferred them (to others) on that day, in the distribution (of spoils). Upon this a person said: By Allah, neither justice has been done in this distribution (of spoils), nor has the pleasure of Allah been sought in it. I (the narrator ) said: By Allah, I will certainly inform the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it. I came to him and informed him about what he had said. The colour of his (the Prophet's) face changed red like blood and he then said: "Who would do justice, if Allah and His Messenger do not do justice?" He further said: "May Allah have mercy upon Moses; he was tormented more than this, but he showed patience." I said: Never would I convey him (the Holy Prophet) after this (unpleasant) narration.
1062.02 | Abdullah reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) distributed spoils (of war). Upon this a person said: This is a distribution In which the pleasure of Allah has not been sought. I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him in an undertone. He (the Holy Prophet) was deeply angry at this and his face became red till I wished that I had not made a mention of it to him. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: Moses was tormented more than this, but he showed patience.
1063.01 | Jabir b. Abdullah reported that a person came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at Jirana on his way back from Hunain, and there was in the clothes of Bilal some silver. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took a handful out of that and bestowed it upon the people. He (the person who had met the Prophet at Ji'rana) said to him:Muhammad, do justice. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Woe be upon thee, who would do justice if I do not do justice, and you would be very unfortunate and a loser if I do not do justice. Upon this Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) said: Permit me to kill this hypocrite. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: May there be protection of Allah! People would say that I kill my companions. This man and his companions would recite the Qur'an but it would not go beyond their throat, and they swerve from it just as the arrow goes through the prey.
1063.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jabir b. 'Abdullah through another chain of transmitters.
1064.01 | Abu Said Khudri reported that 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) sent some gold alloyed with dust to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) distributed that among four men, al-Aqra b. Habis Hanzali and Uyaina b. Badr al-Fazari and 'Alqama b. 'Ulatha al-'Amiri, then to one person of the tribe of Kilab and to Zaid al-Khair al-Ta'l, and then to one person of the tribe of Nabhan. Upon this the people of Quraish felt angry and said:He (the Holy Prophet) gave to the chiefs of Najd and ignored us. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I have done it with a view to conciliating between them. Then there came a person with thick beard, prominent cheeks, deep sunken eyes and protruding forehead and shaven head. He said: Muhammad, fear Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "If I disobey Allah, who would then obey Him? Have I not been (sent as the) most trustworthy among the people of the world? But you do not repose trust in me." That person then went back. A person among the people then sought permission (from the Holy Prophet) for his murder. According to some, it was Khalid b. Walid who sought the permission. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said: From this very person's posterity there would arise people who would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throat; they would kill the followers of Islam and would spare the idol-worshippers. They would glance through the teachings of Islam so hurriedly just as the arrow passes through the pray. If I were to ever find them I would kill them like 'Ad.
1064.02 | Abu Said al-Khudri reported:'Ali b. Abu Talib sent to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from Yemen some gold alloyed with clay in a leather bag dyed in the leaves of Mimosa flava. He distributed it among four men. 'Uyaina b. Hisna, Aqra' b. Habis and Zaid al-Khail, and the fourth one was either Alqama b. 'Ulatha or 'Amir b. Tufail. A person from among his (Prophet's) Companions said: We had a better claim to this (wealth) than these (persons). This (remark) reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) upon which he said: Will you not trust me, whereas I am a trustee of Him Who is in the heaven? The news come to me from the heaven morning and evening. Then there stood up a person with deep sunken eyes, prominent cheek bones, and elevated forehead, thick beard, shaven head, tucked up loincloth, and he said: Messenger of Allah, fear Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Woe to thee. Do I not deserve most to fear Allah amongst the people of the earth? That man then returned. Khalid b. Walid then said: Messenger of Allah, should I not strike his neck? Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Perhaps he may be observing the prayer. Khalid said: How many observers of prayer are there who profess with their tongue what is not in their heart? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I have not been commanded to pierce through the hearts of people, nor to split their bellies (insides). He again looked at him and he was going back. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: There would arise a people from the progeny of this (man) who would recite the Qur'an glibly, but it would not go beyond their throats; they would (hurriedly) pass through (the teachings of their) religion just as the arrow passes through the prey. I conceive that he (the Holy Prophet) also said this: If I find them I would certainly kill them as were killed the (people of) Thamud.
1064.03 | This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters and (the narrator) made a mention of elevated forehead, but he made no mention of tucked-up loin cloth and made this addition:" There stood up 'Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him), and said: Should I not strike his neck? Upon this he said: No. Then he turned away, and Khalid the Sword of Allah stood up against him, and said: Prophet of Allah. shall I not strike off his neck? He said, No, and then said: A people would rise from his progeny who would recite the Book of Allah glibly and fluently. 'Umar said: I think he (the Holy Prophet) also said this: If I find them I would certainly kill them like Thamud."
1064.04 | This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters, but no mention has been made of:" If I find them, I would kill them as the Thamud were killed."
1064.05 | Abu Salama and 'Ata' b. Yasar came to Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and asked him about Haruriya, saying:Did you hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) making a mention of them? He (Abu Sai'd al-Khudri) said: I don't know who the Haruriya are, but I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: There would arise in this nation (and he did not say" out of them" ) a people and you would hold insignificant your prayers as compared with their prayers. And they would recite the Qur'an which would not go beyond their throats and would swerve through the religion (as blank) just as a (swift) arrow passes through the prey. The archer looks at his arrow, at its iron head and glances at its end (which he held) in the tip of his fingers to see whether it had any stain of blood.
1064.06 | Abu Sai'd al-Khudri reported:When we were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was distributing the spoils of war, there came to him Dhul-Khuwasira, one of Banu Tamim. He said: Messenger of Allah, do justice. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Woe be upon thee! Who would do justice, if I do not do justice? You would be unsuccessful and incurring a loss, if I do not do justice. Upon this Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) said: Messenger of Allah, permit me to strike off his neck. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Leave him, for he has friends (who would outwardly look to be so religious and pious) that everyone among you would consider his prayer insignificant as compared with their prayer, and his fast as compared with their fasts. They would recite the Qur'an but it would not go beyond their collar-bones. They would pass through (the teachings of Islam so hurriedly) just as the arrow passes through the prey. He would look at its Iron head, but would not find anything ticking) there. He would then see at the lowest end, but would not find anything sticking there. He would then see at its grip but would not find anything sticking to it. He would then see at its feathers and he would find nothing sticking to them (as the arrow would pass so quickly that nothing would stick to it) neither excrement nor blood. They would be recognised by the presence of a black man among them whose upper arms would be like a woman's breast, or like a piece of meat as it quivers, and they would come forth at the time when there is dissension among the people. Abu Sai'd said: I testify to the fact that I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and I testify to the fact that 'Ali b. Abu Talib fought against them and I was with him. He gave orders about that man who was sought for, and when he was brought in, and when I looked at him, he was exactly as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had described him.
1065.01 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a mention of a sect that would be among his Ummah which would emerge out of the dissension of the people. Their distinctive mark would be shaven heads. They would be the worst creatures or the worst of the creatures. The group who would be nearer to the truth out of the two would kill them. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) gave an example (to give their description) or he said:A man throws an arrow at the prey (or he said at the target), and sees at its iron head, but finds no sign (of blood there), or he sees at the lowest end, but would not see or find any sign (of blood there). He would then see into the grip but would not find (anything) sticking to it. Abu Sai'd then said: People of Iraq. it is you who have killed them.
1065.02 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:A group would secede itself (from the Ummah) when there would be dissension among the Muslims. Out of the two groups who would be nearer the truth would kill them.
1065.03 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:There would be two groups in my Ummah, and there would emerge another group (seceding itself from both of them), and the party nearer to the truth among the two would kill them (the group of the Khawarij).
1065.04 | It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"A group will secede at a time of division among the people, and they will be killed by the group that is closer to the truth."
1065.05 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that a group (Khawarij) would emerge from the different parties (the party of Hadrat 'Ali and the party of Amir Mu'awiya), the group nearer the truth between the two would kill them.
1066.01 | 'Ali said:Whenever I narrate to you anything from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) believe it to be absolutely true as falling from the sky is dearer to me than that of attributing anything to him (the Holy Prophet) which he never said. When I talk to you of anything which is between me and you (there might creep some error in it) for battle is an outwitting. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: There would arise at the end of the age a people who would be young in age and immature in thought, but they would talk (in such a manner) as if their words are the best among the creatures. They would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass through the religion as an arrow goes through the prey. So when you meet them, kill them, for in their killing you would get a reward with Allah on the Day of Judgement.
1066.02 | A hadith like this has been narrated through another chain of transmitters.
1066.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of A'mash with the same chain of transmitters, but (these words) are not there:" They pass through the religion clean as the arrow passes through the prey."
1066.04 | 'Abida narrated from 'Ali that he made a mention of the Khawarij (and in this connection) said that there would be a person among them with a defective hand (or with a short hand) or a fleshy hand. If you were to exercise restraint, I would tell you what Allah has promised to those who would kill them on the order of Muhammad (ﷺ). I (the narrator) said to him:Did you hear it from Muhammad (ﷺ)? He (Hadrat 'Ali) said: Yes, by the Lord of the Ka'bah; Yes, by the Lord of the Ka'bah; yes, by the Lord of the Ka'bah.
1066.05 | 'Abida said:I will not narrate to you except what I heard from him (Hadrat 'Ali), and then he narrated from him.
1066.06 | Zaid b. Wahb Juhani reported and he was among the squadron which was under the command of Ali (Allah be pleased with him) and which set out (to curb the activities) of the Khawarij. 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said:O people, I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: There would arise from my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur'an, and your recital would seem insignificant as compared with their recital, your prayer as compared with their prayer, and your fast, as compared with their fast. They would recite the Qur'an thinking that it supports them, whereas it is an evidence against them. Their prayer does not get beyond their collar bone; they would swerve through Islam just as the arrow passes through the prey. If the squadron which is to encounter them were to know (what great boon) has been assured to them by their Messenger (ﷺ) they would completely rely upon this deed (alone and cease to do other good deeds), and their (that of the Khawarij) distinctive mark is that there would be (among them) a person whose wrist would be without the arm, and the end of his wrist would be fleshy like the nipple of the breast on which there would be white hair. You would be marching towards Muawiya and the people of Syria and you would leave them behind among your children and your property (to do harm). By Allah, I believe that these are the people (against whom you have been commanded to fight and get reward) for they have shed forbidden blood, and raided the animals of the people. So go forth in the name of Allah (to fight against them). Salama b. Kuhail mentioned that Zaid b. Wahb made me alight at every stage, till we crossed a bridge. 'Abdullah b. Wahb al-Rasibi was at the head of the Khawarij when we encountered them. He ('Abdullah) said to his army: Throw the spears and draw out your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they would attack you as they attacked you on the day of Harura. They went back and threw their spears and drew out their swords, and people fought against them with spears and they were killed one after another. Only two persons were killed among the people (among the army led by 'Ali) on that day. 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: Find out from among them (the dead bodies of the Khawarij) (the maimed). They searched but did not find him. 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) then himself stood up and (walked) till he came to the people who had been killed one after another. He ('Ali) said: Search them to the last, and then ('Ali's companions) found him (the dead body of the maimed) near the earth. He ('Ali) then pronounced Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) and then said, Allah told the Truth and His Messenger (ﷺ) conveyed it. Then there stood before him 'Abida Salmani who said: Commander of the Believers, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He, (tell me) whether you heard this hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: Yes, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He. He asked him to take an oath thrice and he took the oath.
1066.07 | 'Ubaidullah b. Abu Rafi', the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said:When Haruria (the Khawarij) set out and as he was with 'Ali b. Abu Talib (Allah be pleased with him) they said, "There is no command but that of Allah." Upon this 'Ali said: The statement is true but it is intentionally applied (to support) a wrong (cause). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) described their characteristics and I found these characteristics in them. They state the truth with their tongue, but it does not go beyond this part of their bodies (and the narrator pointed towards his throat). The most hateful among the creation of Allah is one black man among them (Khawarij). One of his hand is like the teat of a goat or the nipple of the breast. When 'Ali b. Abu Talib (Allah be pleased with him) killed them, he said: Search (for his dead body). They searched for him, but they did not find it (his dead body). Upon this he said: Go (and search for him). By Allah, neither I have spoken a lie nor has the lie been spoken to me. 'Ali said this twice and thrice. They then found him (the dead body) in a rain. They brought (his dead) body till they placed it before him (Hadrat 'Ali). 'Ubaidullah said: And, I was present at (that place) when this happened and when 'Ali said about them. A person narrated to me from Ibn Hanain that he said: I saw that black man.
1067 | Abu Dharr reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Verily there would arise from my Ummah after me or soon after me a group (of people) who would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass clean through their religion just as the arrow passes through the prey, and they would never come back to it. They would be the worst among the creation and the creatures. Ibn Samit (one of the narrators) said: I met Rafi' b. 'Amr Ghifari, the brother of Al-Hakam Ghifari and I said: What is this hadith that I heard from Abu Dharr, i. e. so and so? and then I narrated that hadith to him and said: I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
1068.01 | Yusair b. 'Amr reported that he inquired of Sahl b. Hunaif:Did you hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) making a mention of the Khawarij? He said: I heard him say (and he pointed with his hand towards the east) that these would be a people who would recite the Qur'an with their tongues and it would not go beyond their collar bones. They would pass clean through their religion just as the arrow passes through the prey.

1070.02 | Out of so many ahadith which Hammam b. Munabbih narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one is this that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:I go back to my family and I find a date lying on my bed or in my house, and I take it up to eat it, but then I throw it away fearing that it may be a Sadaqa or from Sadaqa.

1072.01 | 'Abd al-Muttalib b. Rabi'a b. al-Harith reported that Rabi'a b. al-Harith and Abbas b. Abd al-Muttalib gathered together and said:By Allah, if we had sent these two young boys (i. e. I and Fadl b. 'Abbas) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and they had spoken to him, he would have appointed them (as the collectors) of these sadaqat; and they would (collect them) and pay (to the Holy Prophet) as other people (collectors) paid and would get a share as other people got it. As they were talking about it there came 'Ali b. Abu Talib and stood before them, and they made a mention of it to him. 'Ali b. Abu Talib said: Don't do that; by Allah he (the Holy Prophet) would not do that (would not accept your request). Rabi'a b. Harith turned to him and said: By Allah, you are not doing so but out of jealousy that you nurse against us By Allah, you became the son-in-law of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) but we felt no jealousy against you (for this great privilege of yours). 'Ali then said: Send them (if you like). They set out and 'Ali lay on the bed. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered the noon prayer. we went ahead of him to his apartment and stood near it till he came out. He took hold of our ears (out of love and affection) and then said: Give out what you have kept in your hearts. He then entered (the apartment) and we also went in and he (the Holy Prophet) was on that day (in the house of) Zainab b. jahsh. We urged each (of us) to speak. Then one of us thus spoke: Messenger of Allah, you are the best of humanity and the best to cement the ties of blood-relations. We have reached the-marriageable age. We have come (to you) so that you may appoint us (as collectors) of these sadaqat. and we would pay you just as thin people (other collectors) pay you, and get our share as others get it. He (the Holy Prophet) kept silence for a long time till we wished that we should speak with him (again), and Zainab pointied to us from behind the curtain not to talk (any more). He (the Holy Prophet) said; It does not become the family of Muhammad (to accept) sadaqat for they are the impurities of people. You call to me Mahmiya (and he was in charge of khums, i. e, of the one-fifth part that goes to the treasury out of the spoils of war), and Naufal b. Harith b. 'Abd al-Muttalib. They both came to him, and he (the Holy Prophet) said to Mahmiya: Marry your daughter to this young man (i. e. Fadl b. 'Abbas), and he married her to him And he said to Naufal b. Harith: Marry your daughter to this young man (i e. 'Abd al-Muttalib b. Rabi'a, the narrator of this hadith) and he married her to me, and he said to Mahmiya: Pay so much mahr on behalf of both of them from this khums Zuhri, however. said: He did not determine (the amount of mahr).
1072.02 | Rabi'a b. Harith b. 'Abd al-Muttalib and Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib said to Abd al-Muttalib b. Rabi'a and Fadl b. Ibn Abbas:Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the rest of the hadith is the same (but with this addition):" 'Ali spread his cloak and then lay down on it and said: I am the father of Hasan, and I am the chief. By Allah, I would not move from my place till your sons come back to you with the reply to that for which you sent them to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). And he then also said: Verily these sadaqat are the impurities of people, and they are not permissible for Muhammad (may peaace be upon him), and for the family of Muhammad. And he also said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) also said to me: Call Mahmiya b. Jaz', and he was person from Banu Asad. and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had appointed him as a collector of khums.

1086.03 | This hadith has been narrated by Ibn Abu Khalid with the same chain of transmitters.
1087 | Kuraib reported that Umm Fadl, daughter of Harith, sent him (Fadl, i.e. her son) to Mu'awiya in Syria. I (Fadl) arrived in Syria, and did the needful for her. It was there in Syria that the month of Ramadan commenced. I saw the new moon (of Ramadan) on Friday. I then came back to Medina at the end of the month. Abdullah b. 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) asked me (about the new moon of Ramadan) and said:When did you see it? I said: We saw it on the night of Friday. He said: (Did) you see it yourself? I said: Yes, and the people also saw it and they fasted and Mu'awiya also fasted, whereupon he said: But we saw it on Saturday night. So we will continue to fast till we complete thirty (fasts) or we see it (the new moon of Shawwal). I said: Is the sighting of the moon by Mu'awiya not valid for you? He said: No; this is how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has commanded us. Yahya b. Yahya was in doubt (whether the word used in the narration by Kuraib) was Naktafi or Taktafi.
1088.01 | Abu'l-Bakhtari reported:We went out to perform Umra and when we encamped in the valley of Nakhla, we tried to see the new moon. Some of the people said: It was three nights old, and others (said) that it was two nights old. We then met Ibn 'Abbas and told him we had seen the new moon, but that some of the people said it was three nights old and others that it was two nights old. He asked on which night we had seen it; and when we told him we had seen it on such and such night, he said the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) had said: Verily Allah deferred it till the time it is seen, so it is to be reckoned from the night you saw it.
1088.02 | Abu'l-Bakhtari reported:We saw the new moon of Ramadan as we were at Dhit-i-'Irq. We sent a man to Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with both of them) to ask him (whether the sighting of a small moon had something of the nature of defect in it). Upon this Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with both of them) said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said: Verily Allah deferred its sight, but if (the new moon) is hidden from you, then, complete its number (thirty).
1089.01 | The son of Abu Bakra reported it on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said:The two months of 'Id, Ramadan and Dhu'l-Hijja (are not incomplete).
1089.02 | 'Abd ar-Rahman b. Abu Bakra reported on the authority of Abu Bakra that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said:The months of 'Id are not incomplete. And in the hadith narrated by Khalid (the words are):" The months, of 'Id are Ramadan and Dhu'l-Hijja."
1090 | 'Adi b. Hatim (Allah be pleased with him) reported that when (this verse) was revealed:" Until the white streak of the dawn becomes distinct from the dark streak" (ii. 187) Adi b. Hatim said: Messenger of Allah, verily I keep underneath my pillow two strings, one white and the other black, by which I distinguish night from dawn. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Your pillow seems to be very large. For the word khait implies the blackness of the night and the whiteness of the dawn.
1091.01 | Sahl b. Sa'd said that when this verse was revealed:" Eat and drink till the white streak is distinct from the dark streak," a person would take hold of a white thread and a black thread and keep on eating till he could find them distinct (in the light of the dawn). It was then that Allah, the Majestic and Great, reveiled (the words) min al-fajr (from the dawn), and then it became clear (that the word khait refers to the streak of light in the dawn).
1091.02 | Sahl b. Sa'd (Allah be pleased with him) said:When this verse was revealed." Eat and drink till the white streak becomes distinct from the dark streak for you," the person who decided to observe fast tied on one of his feet a black thread and on the other a white thread. And he went on eating and drinking till he could distinguish (between their colour) on seeing them. It was after this that Allah reveal- ed (the words): min al-fajr. And they (the Muslims) came to know that (the word khait) refers to the night and day.
1092.01 | 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said:Bilal would pronounce Adhan (at the fag end of the night in order to inform the people about the time of the Sahri). So you eat and drink till you hear the Adhan of Ibn Umm Maktum (which was pro- nounced at the conclusion of the Sahri and the commencement of the fast).
1092.02 | Abdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: Bilal announces Adhan during the night, so you eat and drink, till you hear the Adhan of Ibn Umm Maktum.
1092.03 | Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had two Mu'adhdhins, Bilal and son of Umm Maktum, the blind. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Bilal announces Adhan at (the fag end of the) night (i. e. Sahri), so eat and drink till the son of Umm Maktum announces Adhan. And he (the narrator) said: And the (difference of time) between their (Adhans) was not more than this that one climbed down (from the minaret) and the other climbed up (to announce Adhan).
1092.04 | A hadith like this has been transmitted on the authority of 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her).
1092.05 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of 'Ubaidullah on the two chains of transmitters.
1093.01 | Ibn Mas'ud (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying The Adhan of Bilal should not restrain anyone among you from eating Sahur (last meal before daybreak during the month of Ramadan) for he announces Adhan (or he calls) at (the fag end of) the night to make him turn who stands for prayer among you, and to awaken those who are sleeping among you. And he said:The dawn is not like it, as one says (and he lifted his hand) till he (dispersed his fingers) and said: It is like this.
1093.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Sulaiman al-Taimi with the same chain of transmitters (but with a slight variation of words) that he (the Holy Prophet) said:The dawn is not like it as it is said; he then gathered his fingers and lowered them. But he said, it is like this (and he placed the index finger upon the other one and spread his hand).
1093.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sulaiman Taimi with the same chain of transmitters and, at the end, it was said that the first Adhan was meant to awaken those who were in slumber amongst them and in order to make them turn who stand in (prayer) among them (towards food at the commencement of the fast). Jarir (one of the narrators) said that the Messenger (ﷺ) did not say like this but he said like it (true dawn) that the streaks of (true dawn ) are horizontal and not vertical.
1094.01 | Samura b. Jandub reported Muhammad (ﷺ) as saying. The call of Bilal may not mislead any one of you (and he may, under the wrong impression gathered from it, refrain) from taking meal before the commencement of the fast (for the streaks) of this whiteness (which are vertical indicate the false dawn and the true dawn with which the fast commences is that when the streaks of light are) spread.
1094.02 | Samura b. Jundub reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The Adhan of Bilal should not mislead you nor the whiteness (of the pillar) of dawn, for it is not the whiteness of the true dawn, but that of the false dawn which is vertical like a pillar and you can eat food till the streaks of whiteness spread like it.
1094.03 | Samura b. Jundub (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The Adhan of Bilal may not mislead you with regard to your food at the commencement of the fast, nor the vertical (streaks) of whiteness in the horizon (for it is an indication of false dawn). You should stop eating (food) till (the whiteness) spreads like it. Hammad narrated it and with the gesture of his band he explained, the horizontal position (of the streaks of light).
1094.04 | Samura b. Jundub addressed and narrated from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) having said (these words):Neither the call of Bilal should mislead you nor this whiteness (of false dawn) till (the true) dawn appears (or he said) till the dawn breaks.
1094.05 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Samura b. Jundub.
1095 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Take meal a little before dawn, for there is a blessing in taking meal at that time.
1096.01 | 'Amr b. al-'As reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The difference between our fasting and that of the people of the Book is eating shortly before dawn.
1096.02 | Musa b. 'Ali has narrated this hadith through the same chain of transmitters.
1097.01 | Zaid b. Thabit (Allah be pleased with him) said:We took meal shortly before dawn along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We then stood up for prayer. I said: How much span of time was there between the two (acts, i. e. taking of Sahri and observing of prayer)? He said (a span of reciting) fifty verses.
1097.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Qatada too.
1098.01 | Sahl b. Sa'd (Allah be pleased with him) repotted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The people will continue to prosper as long as they hasten the breaking of the fast.
1098.02 | A hadith like this has been transmitted by Sahl b. Sa'd.
1099.01 | Abu 'Atiyya reported:I and Masruq went to 'A'isha and said to her: Mother of the Believers, there are two persons among the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) one among whom hastens in breaking the fast and in observing prayer, and the other delays breaking the fast and delays observing prayer. She said: Who among the two hastens in breaking fast and observing prayers? We said, It is 'Abdullah. i. e. son of Mas'ud. whereupon she said: This is how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did. Abu Kuraib added: The second one was Abu Musa.
1099.02 | Abu 'Atiyya reported:I and Misruq went to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and Masruq said to her: There are two persons among the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) none of whom abandons the good, but one of them hastens to observe sunset prayer and break the fast, and the other delays in observing the sunset prayer and in breaking the fast, whereupon she said: Who hastens to observe sunset prayer and break the fast? He said: It is 'Abdullah. Upon this she said: This is how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do.
1100 | 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:When the night approaches and the day retreates and the sun sinks down, then the observer of the fast should break it. Ibn Numair made no mention of the word" then".
1101.01 | 'Abdullah b. Abi Aufa reported:We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey during the month of Ramadan. When the sun had sunk he said: So and so, get down (from your ride) and prepare the meal of parched barley for us. He said: Messenger of Allah, still (there is light of) day. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Get down and prepare meal of parched barley for us. So he got down and prepared the meal of parched barley and offered him, and the apostle of Allah (ﷺ) drank that (liquid meal). He then told with the gesture of his hand that when the sun sank from that side and the night appeared from that side, then the observer of the fast should break it.
1101.02 | Ibn Abi Aufa (Allah be pleased with him) reported:We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey. When the sun sank he said to a person: Get down and prepare barley meal for us. Upon this he said: Messenger of Allah, let there be dusk. (He the Holy Prophet) said: Get down and prepare barley meal for us. He (the person) said: There is still (the light of) day upon us. (But) he got down (in obedience to the command of the Holy Prophet) and prepared a barley meal for him and he (the Holy Prophet) drank that (liquid meal) and then said: When you see the night approaching from that side (west) (and he pointed towards the east with his hand), then the observer of the fast should break it.
1101.03 | Abdullah b. Abi Aufa (Allah be pleased with him) reported:We travelled with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as he had been observing fast. When the sun sank he said: So and so, get down and prepare barley meal for us. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1101.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Abi Aufa (Allah be pleased with him) through another chain of transmitters (but with a sight alteration of words):In this hadith transmitted by one of the narrators (neither these words are found): During the month of Ramadan." nor his statement:" And the night prevails from that side (the eastern side)." (These words are found in the narration of) Hushaim only.
1102.01 | Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with both of them) said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade uninterrupted fasting. They (some of the Companions) said:You yourself fast uninterruptedly, whereupon he said: I am not like you. I am fed and supplied drink (by Allah).
1102.02 | Ibn 'Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed fasts uninterruptedly in Ramadan and the people (in his wake) did this. But he forbade them to do so. It was said to him (to the Holy Prophet):You yourself observe the fasts uninterruptedly (but you forbid us to do so) Upon this he said: I am not like you; I am fed and supplied drink (by Allah).
1102.03 | A hadith like this has been transmitted by Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with both of them), but he did not make mention of (the words):" During the month of Ramadan."
1103.01 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade (his Companions) from observing fast uninterruptedly. One of the Muslims said: Messenger of Allah, you yourself observe Saum Wisal, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who among you is like me? I spend night (in a state) that my Allah feeds me and provides me drink. When they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) did not agree in abandoning the uninterrupted fast, then the Prophet (ﷺ) also observed this fast with them for a day, and then for a day. They then saw the new moon and he (the Holy Prophet) said: If the appearance of the new moon were delayed. I would have observed more (fasts) with you (and he did it) by way of warning to them as they had not agreed to refrain (from observing Saum Wisal)
1103.02 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Abstain from Saum-Wisal. They (his Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, but you observe Saum Wisal. Upon this he said: You are not like me in this matter, for I spend my night (in a state) that my Lord feeds me and provides me drink Devote yourselves to the deeds (the burden of which) you can bear.
1103.03 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying (the words as said in the previous hadith) but with this alteration (of words):" Take upon yourselves (the burden of the deeds) for which you have the strength to bear."

1104.01 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was observing prayer during Ramadan. I came and stood by his side. Then another man came and he stood likewise till we became a group. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) perceived that we were behind him, he lightened the prayer. He then went to his abode and observed such (a long) prayer (the like of which) he never observed with us. When it was morning we said to him:Did you perceive us during the night? Upon this he said: Yes, it was this (realisation) that induced me to do that which I did. He (the narrator) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to observe Saum Wisal at the end of the month (of Ramadan), and some persons among his Companions began to observe this uninter- rupted fast, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What about such persons who observe uninterrupted fasts? You are not like me. By Allah. if the month were lengthened for me, I would have observed Saum Wisal, so that those who act with an exaggeration would (have been obliged) to abandon their exaggeration.
1104.02 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed Saum Wisal during the early part of the month of Ramadan. The people among Muslims also observed uninterrupted fast. This (news) reached him (the Holy Prophet) and he said:Had the month been lengthened for me I would have continued observing Saum Wisal, so that those who act with forced hardness would (have been obliged) to abandon it. You are not like me (or he said): I am not like you. I continue to do so (in a state) that my Lord feeds me and provides me drink.
1105 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) forbade them (his Companions) to observe Saum Wisal out of mercy for them. They said: You (Holy Prophet) yourself observe it. Upon this he said: I am not like you. My Lord feeds me and provides me drink.

1106.03 | 'A'isha reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to kiss me while observing fast; and who among you can control his desire as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) could control his desire.

Harith) reported:I heard Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) narrating that he who is overtaken by dawn in a state of seminal emission should not observe fast.

'Abd al-Rahman went and I also went along with him till we came to'A'isha and Umm Salama (Allah be pleased with both of them) and Abd al-Rahman asked them about it. Both of them said: (At times it so happened) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) woke up in the morning in a state of junub (but without seminal emission in a dream) and observed fast He (the narrator) said: We then proceeded till we went to Marwan and Abd al-Rahman made a mention of it to him. Upon this Marwan said: I stress upon you (with an oath) that you better go to Abu Huraira and refer to him what is said about it. So we came to Abu Huraira and Abu Bakr had been with us throughout and 'Abd al-Rahman made a mention of it to him, whereupon Abu Huraira said: Did they (the two wives of the Holy Prophet) tell you this? He replied: Yes Upon this (Abu Huraira) said: They have better knowledge. Abu Huraira then attributed that what was said about it to Fadl b. 'Abbas and said: I heard it from Fadl and not from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Abu Huraira then retracted from what he used to say about it. Ibn Juraij (one of the narrators) reported: I asked 'Abd al-Malik, if they (the two wives) said (made the statement) in regard to Ramadan, whereupon he said: It was so, and he (the Holy Prophet) (woke up in the) morning in a state of junub which was not due to the wet dream and then observed fast.
1109.02 | 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said:The dawn broke upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the Ramadan in a state of junub not because of sexual dream (but on account of intercourse) and he washed himself and observed fast.

1110 | 'A'isha reported that a person came to the Apottle of Allah (ﷺ) asking for a fatwa (religious verdict). She ('A'isha) had been overhearing it from behind the curtain. 'A'isha added that he (the person) had said:Messenger of Allah, (the time) of prayer overtakes me as I am in a state of junub; should I observe fast (in this state)? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: (At times the time) of prayer overtakes me while I am in a state of junub, and I observe fast (in that very state), whereupon he said: Messenger of Allah, you are not like us Allah has pardoned all your sins, the previous ones and the later ones. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I hope I am the most God-fearirg of you, and possess the best knowledge among you of those (things) against which I should guard.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Give these (dates) in charity. He (the man) said: Am I to give to one who is poorer than I? There is no family poorer than mine between the two lava plains of Medina. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) laughed so that his molar teeth became visible and said: Go and give it to your family to eat.

He commanded him to sit down, (In the meanwhile) there were brought to him (to the Holy Prophet) two baskets containing eatables, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told him to give them as sadaqa.

Zubair reported that he had heard 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), as saying:A person came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the mosque during (the month of) Ramadan and said: Messenger of Allah, I am burnt, I am burnt, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked him as to what the matter was. Upon this he said: I had intercourse with my wife (in a state of fasting) Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Give charity. Upon this he said: Apostle of Allah, I swear by God, there is nothing with me (to give in charity) as I do not possess anything. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Sit down. So he sat down and he was in this very state when there came a person urging a donkey with a load of eatables upon it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Where is that burnt one who was just here? Thereupon the person stood up. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Give this (eatables brought by the man) in charity. Upon this the person said: Messenger of Allah, can there be anyone else (more deserving than I)? By Allah. we are hungry, we have nothing with us. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Then eat (these eatables).

Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The breakers of the fast have taken away the reward today.
1119.02 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was journeying (along with his Companions). Some of them had observed the fast whereas the others had broken it.

1120 | Qaza'a reported:I came to Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) and he was surrounded (by people), and when they dispersed I said to him: I am not going to ask you about what these people were asking. I ask you about fasting on a journey. Upon this he said: We travelled with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) towards Mecca and we had been observing fast. We halted at a place. There the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You are nearing your enemy and breaking of fast would give you greater strength, and that was a concession (given to us). But some of us continued to observe the fast and some of us broke it. We then got down at another place and he (the Holy Prophet) said: You are going to encounter the enemy in the morning and breaking of the fast would give you strength, so break the fast. As it was a point of stress, so we broke the fast. But subsequently we saw ourselves observing the fast with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey.

1148.04 | Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported:A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, my mother has died and there is due from her a fast of vow; should I fast on her behalf? Thereupon he said: You see that if your mother had died in debt, would it not have been paid on her behalf? She said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then observe fast on behalf of your mother.
1149.01 | Abdullah b. Buraida (Allah be pleased with him) reported on the authority of his father:When we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), a woman came to him and said: I had gifted to my mother a maid-servant, and now she (the mother) has died. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: There is a definite reward for you and she (the maid-servant) has been returned to you as an inheritance. She (that woman) again said: Fasts of a month (of Ramadan) are due upon her; should I observe them on her behalf? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Observe fasts on her behalf. She (again) said: She did not perform Hajj, should I perform it on her behalf? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Perform Hajj on her behalf.
1149.02 | 'Abdullah b. Buraida (Allah be pleased with him) reported on the authority of his father:I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ; the rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation that the (the narrator) said:" Fasts of two months."
1149.03 | Ibn Buraida (Allah be pleased with him) reported on the authority of his father:A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the rest of the hadith is the same, but he said:" Fasting of one month."
1149.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sufyan with the same chain of transmitters in which it is said:" Fasting of two months."
1149.05 | Buraida (Allah be pleased with him) reported a similar hadith on the authority of his father that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said:" Fasting for one month."
1150 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:If any one of you is invited to a meal when he is fasting, he should say:" I am fasting."
1151.01 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported:When any one of you gets up in the morning in the state of fasting, he should neither use obscene language nor do any act of ignorance. And if anyone slanders him or quarrels with him, he should say:" I am fasting, I am fasting."
1151.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Allah, the Majestic and the Exalted, said: Every act of the son of Adam is for him except fasting. It is done for My sake, and I will give a reward for it. By Allah in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, the breath of the observer of fast is sweeter to Allah than the fragrance of musk.
1151.03 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Fasting is a shield.
1151.04 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Allah the Exalted and Majestic said: Every act of the son of Adam is for him, except fasting. It is (exclusively) meant for Me and I (alone) will reward it. Fasting is a shield. When any one of you is fasting on a day, he should neither indulge in obscene language, nor raise the voice; or if anyone reviles him or tries to quarrel with him he should say: I am a person fasting. By Him, in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, the breath of the observer of fast is sweeter to Allah on the Day of judgment than the fragrance of musk. The one who fasts has two (occasions) of joy, one when he breaks the fast he is glad with the breaking of (the fast) and one when he meets his Lord he is glad with his fast.
1151.05 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Every (good) deed of the son of Adam would be multiplied, a good deed receiving a tenfold to seven hundredfold reward. Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, has said: With the exception of fasting, for it is done for Me and I will give a reward for it, for one abandons his passion and food for My sake. There are two occasions of joy for one who fasts, joy when he breaks it, and joy when he meets his Lord, and the breath (of an observer of fast) is sweeter to Allah than the fragrance of musk.
1151.06 | Abu Huraira and Abu Sa'id (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (as saying):Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, said: Fast (is exclusively) meant for Me and I would give its reward. There are two (occasions) of joy for the observer of fast. He feels joy when he breaks the fast and he is happy when he meets Allah. By Allah in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, the breath of the observer of fast is sweeter to Allah than the fragrance of musk.
1151.07 | A hadith like this is narrated on the authority of Abu Sinan with the same chain of transmitters (and the words are):" As he meets Allah, He rewards him, and he is happy."
1152 | Sahl b. Sa'd (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:In Paradise there is a gate which is called Rayyan through which only the people who fast would enter on the Day on Resurrection. None else would enter along with them. It would be proclaimed: Where are the people who fast that they should be admitted into it? And when the last of them would enter, it would be closed and no one would enter it.
1153.01 | Abu Sa'id al Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Every servant of Allah who observes fast for a day in the way of Allah, Allah would remove, because of this day, his face farther from the Fire (of Hell) to the extent of seventy years' distance.

1154.01 | 'A'isha, the Mother of the Believers (Allah be pleased with her), reported that one day the Messenger of Allah may peace be upon him) said to me:'A'isha, have you anything (to eat)? I said: 'Messenger of Allah, there is nothing with us. Thereupon he said: I am observing fast. She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out, and there was a present, for us and (at the same time) some visitors dropped in. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came back, I said to him: Messenger of Allah, a present was given to us, (and in the meanwhile) there came to us visitors (a major Portion of it has been spent on them), but I have saved something for you. He said: What is it? I said: It is hais (a compound of dates and clarified butter). He said: Bring that. So I brought it to him and he ate it and then said: I woke up in the morning observing fast. Talha said: I narrated this hadith to Mujahid and he said: This (observing of voluntary fast) is like a person who sets apart Sadaqa out of his wealth. He may spend it if he likes, or he may retain it if he so likes.
1154.02 | 'A'isha, the Mother of the Believers (Allah be pleased with her), reported:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) came to me one day and said: Is there anything with you (to eat)? I said: No. Thereupon he said: I shall then be fasting. Then he came to us another day and we said: Messenger of Allah, hais has been offered to us as a gift. Thereupon he said: Show that to me; I had been fasting since morning. He then ate it.
1155 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone forgets that he is fasting and eats or drinks he should complete his fast, for it is only Allah Who has fed him and given him drink.
1156.01 | Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported:I said to'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her): Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fast for a full month besides Ramadan? She said: I do not know of any month in which he fasted throughout, but that of the month of Ramadan and (the month) in which he did not fast at all, till he ran the course of his life.
1156.02 | 'Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported:I said to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her): Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observe fast during a month? She said, I do not know of any month in which he fasted throughout except Ramadan and (the month) in which he did not fast at all till he ran the course of his life. May peace be upon him.
1156.03 | Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported. I asked 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) about fasting of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said:He used to observe fast (at times) so continuously that we said: He has fasted, he has fasted. And (at times) he did not observe fast (for days) and we began to say: He has abandoned fasting, he has abandoned fasting. She said: I did not see him observing fast throughout the whole of the month since he arrived in Medina, but that of Ramadan.
1156.04 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Shaqiq but in the chain of transmitters no mention is made of Hisham and Muhammad.
1156.05 | 'A'isha, the Mother of the Believers (Allah be pleased with her), reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to fast (so continuously) that we said that he would not break, and did not fast at all till we said that he would not fast. And I did not see the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) completing the fast of a month, but that of Ramadan, and I did not see him fasting more in any other month than that of Sha'ban.
1156.06 | Abu Salama reported:I asked 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) about the fasting of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said: He used to observe fast (at times so continuously) that we said: He has fasted (never to break), and he did not observe fast till we said: He has given up perhaps never to fast, and I never saw him observing (voluntary fasts) more in any other month than that of Sha'ban. (lt appeared as if) he observed fast throughout the whole of Sha'ban except a few (days).
782.03 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not observe fast in any month of the year more than in the month of Sha'ban, and used to say: Do as many deeds as you are capable of doing, for Allah will not become weary (of giving you reward), but you would be tired (of doing good deeds) ; and he also said: The deed liked most by Allah is one to which the doer adheres constantly even if it is small.
1157.01 | Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not fast throughout any month except during ramadan. And when he observed fast (he fasted so continuously) that one would say that he would not break (them) and when he Abandoned, he abandoned (so continuously) that one would say: By Allah, perhaps he would never fast.
1157.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Bishr with the same chain of transmitters (with a slight variation of words and these are), that he (the narrator) said:" During any month continuously since he came to Medina."
1157.03 | 'Uthman b. Hakim al-Ansari said:I asked Sa'id b. Jubair about fasting In Rajab, and we were then passing through the month of Rajab, whereupon he said: I heard Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with both of them) as saying: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to observe fast (so continuously) that we (were inclined) to say that he would not break (them) and did not observe them so conti- nuously) that we (were inclined to say) that he would not observe fast.
1157.04 | The same hadith as the previous hadith has been transmitted through another chain.
1158 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to observe fast till it was said that he had observed fast, he had observed fast (perhaps never to break it), and he did not fast till it was said that he had given up fast, he had given up fast (perhaps never to observe it).
1159.01 | 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was informed that he could stand up for (prayer) throughout the night and observe fast every day so long as he lived. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Is it you who said this? I said to him: Messenger of Allah, it is I who said that. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah may peace be upon him) said: You are not capable enough to do so. Observe fast and break it; sleep and stand for prayer, and observe fast for three days during the month; for every good is multiplied ten times and this is like fasting for ever. I said: Messenger of Allah. I am capable of doing more than this. Thereupon he said: Fast one day and do not fast for the next two days. I said: Messenger of Allah, I have the strength to do more than that. The Prophet (ﷺ), said: Fast one day and break on the other day. That is known as the fasting of David (peace be upon him) and that is the best fasting. I said: I am capable of doing more than this. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is nothing better than this. 'Abdullah b. 'Amr (Allah be pleased with them) said: Had I accepted the three days (fasting during every month) as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said, it would have been more dear to me than my family and my property.
1159.02 | Yahya reported:I and 'Abdullah b. Yazid set out till we came to Abu Salama. We sent a messenger to him (in his house in order to inform him about our arrival) and he came to us. There was a mosque near the door of his house, and we were in that mosque, till he came out to us. He said: If you like you may enter (the house) and, if you like, you may sit here (in the mosque). We said: We would rather sit here and (you) relate to us. He (Yahya) then narrated that 'Abdullah b Amr b. al-'As (Allah be pleased with them) told him: I used to observe fast uninterruptedly and recited the (whole of the) Qur'an every night. It (the uninterrupted fasting and recital of the Qur'an every night) was mentioned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) or he sent for me, and I went to him and he said to me: I have been informed that you fast continuously and recite (the whole of the Qur'an) every night. I said: Apostle of Allah, it is right, but I covet thereby nothing but good, whereupon he said: It suffices for you that you should observe fast for three days during every month. I said: Apostle of Allah, I am capable of doing more than this. He said: Your wife has a right upon you, your visitor has a right upon you, your body has a right upon you; so observe the fast of David, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), for he was the best worshipper of Allah. I said: Apostle of Allah, what is the fast of David? He said: He used to fast one day and did not fast the other day. He (also) said: Recite the Qur'an during every month. I said: Apostle of Allah, I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Recite it in twenty days; recite it in ten days. I said: I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Recite it every week, and do not exceed beyond this, for your wife has a right upon you, your visitor has a right upon you, your body has a right upon you. He ('Amr b. 'As) said: I was hard to myself and thus I was put to hardship. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) had told me: 'You do not know you may live long (thus and bear the hardships for a long time), and I accepted that which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had told me. When I grew old I wished I had availed myself of the concession (granted by) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
1159.03 | This hadith has been narrated by Yahya b. Abu Kathir with the same chain of transmitters and he made this addition after these words:During every month, (fasting) for three days, there is for you ten times for every good and that is perpetual fasting (for three days would bring a reward for full thirty days). I said: What is the fast of the Messenger of Allah, David? He said: Half of the age (observing fast on alternate days for the whole life). And in the hadith no mention has been made of the recital of the Qur'an, and he did not say: Your visitor has a right upon you, but (instead) he said: Your son has a right upon you.
1159.04 | 'Abdullah b. 'Amr (Allah be pleased with them) reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Recite the whole of the Qur'An during every month. I said: I find power (to recite it) in a shorter period. He said: Then recite it in twenty nights. I said: I find power (to recite it in a shorter period even than this), whereupon he said: Then recite it in seven (nights) and do not exceed beyond it.
1159.05 | 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As (Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:'Abdullah, don't be like so and so who observed prayer during the whole night and then abandoned it (altogether).
1159.06 | Abdu'llah b. 'Amr b. 'As (Allah be pleased with them) reported:It was conveyed to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that I observe fast successively and pray during the whole night. He sent for me or I met him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It has been conveyed to me that you observe fast continuously and do not break it and pray during the whole night. Don't do that. for there is share for your eyes, share for your own self, share for your family; so observe fast and break it, pray and sleep and observe fast for one day during the ten days, and there is a reward for you (for other) nine (days besides the tenth day of the fast). I said: Apostle of Allah, I find myself more powerful than this. He said: Then observe the fast of David (peace be upon him). He ('Amr) said: Apostle of Allah, how did David observe fast? He (the Holy Prophet) said: He used to fast one day and break it on the other day, and he did not run (from the battlefield) as he encountered (the enemy). He said: Apostle of Allah, who can guarantee this for me (will I also encounter the enemy dauntlessly)? 'Ata', the narrator of the hadith, said: I do not know how there (crept in) the matter of perpetual fast. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ), however, said: He who observed perpetual fast did not fast at all; he who observed perpetual fast did not fast at all, he who observed perpetual fast did not fast at all.
1159.07 | This hadith has been narrated by Ibn Juraij with the same chain of transmitters. Imam Muslim has narrated this hadith on the authority of Abu 'Abbas al-Sa'ib b. Farrukh and he was a trustworthy and reliable (narrator) among the people of Mecca.
1159.08 | Abdullah b. Amr (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: 'Abdullah b. Amr, you fast continuously and stand in prayer for the whole of night. If you do like that, your eyes would be highly strained and would sink and lose sight. There is no (reward for) fasting (for him) who fasts perpetually. Fasting for three days during the month is like fasting, the whole of the month. I said: I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Observe the fast of David. He used to fast one day and break (the other) day. And he did not turn back in the encounter.
1159.09 | This hadith is narrated on the authority of Habib b. Abu Thabit with the same chain of transmitters and he said:" And you would become exhausted."
1159.10 | 'Abdullah b. 'Amr (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: I have been informed that you stand for prayer the whole of night and fast during the day. I said: I do that, whereupon he said: If you did that you in fact strained heavily your eyes and made yourself weak. There is a right of your eyes (upon you) and a right of your self (upon you) and a right of your family (upon you). Stand for prayer and sleep. observe fasts and break (them).
1159.11 | 'Abdullah b. 'Amr (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:With Allah the best fasting is that of David and the best prayer is that of David (peace be upon him) for he slept half of the night and stood for prayer for the third of it and (then) slept the sixth part of it and he observed fast one day and broke on the other.
1159.12 | 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The best fasting in the eye of Allah is that of David, for he fasted for half of the age (he fasted on alternate days), and the best prayer in the eye of Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, is that of David (peace be upon him), for he slept for half of the night and then stood for prayer and then again slept. He prayed for one-third of the night after midnight. He (the narrator) said: I asked 'Amr b. Dinar whether 'Amr b. Aus said that he stood for prayer one-third of the night after midnight. He said: Yes.
1159.13 | Abu Qatada reported that Abu al Malih informed me:I went along with your father to 'Abdullah b. Amr, and he narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was informed about my fasting and he came to me, and I placed a leather cushion filled with fibre of date-palms for him. He sat down upon the ground and there was that cushion between me and him, and he said to me: Does three days' fasting in a month not suffice you? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts). He said: (Would) five (not suffice for you)? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts) He said: (Would) seven (fasts) not suffice you? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts). He (the Holy Prophet) then said: (Would) nine (fasts not suffice you)? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts). He said: (Would) eleven (fasts not suffice you)? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts than these). Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is no fasting (better than) the fasting of David which comprises half of the age, fasting a day and not fasting a day.
1159.14 | 'Abdullah b. Amr (Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said to him:Observe fast for a day and there would be reward for you for the rest (of the days). He said: I am capable of doing more than this. He then said: Observe fast for two days, and there would be reward for you for the rest (of the days). He said: I am capable of doing more than this. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Observe fast for three days and there would be reward for you for the rest of the days. He said: I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Observe fast for four days and there would be reward for you for the rest of the days. He said: I am capable of doing more than this. Thereupon he said: Then observe fast (which is the) best in the eye of Allah, the fast of David (peace be upon him) ; he used to observe fast one day and break on the other day.
1159.15 | 'Abdullah b. 'Amr (Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me! 'Abdullah b. 'Amr, it has been conveyed to me that you observe fast during the day and stand in prayer during the whole night. Don't do that, for your body has a share of its own in you, your eye has a share of its own in you, your wife has a share of her own in you. Observe fast and break it too. Fast for three days in every month and that is a prepetual fasting. I said! Messenger of Allah, I have got strength enough (to do more than this), whereupon he said:Then observe the fast of David (peace be upon him). Observe fast one day and break it (on the other) day. And he ('Abdullah b. 'Amr) used to say: Would that I had availed myself of this concession.
1160 | Mu'adha al-'Adawiyya reported that she asked 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), whether the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed fasts for three days during every month. She said:Yes I said to her: Which were (the particular) days of the month on which he observed fast? She said: He was not particular about the days of the month on which to observe fast.
1161.01 | 'Imran b. Husain (Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him (or he said to another person and he was listening to it):O, so and so, did you observe fast in the middle of the month? He said: No. Thereupon he (the Messenger of Allah) said: When you break it, then observe fast for two days.
1162.01 | Abu Qatada reported that a person came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said:How do you fast? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt annoyed. When 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) noticed his annoyance, he said: We are well pleased with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our code of life, and with Muhammad as our Prophet. We seek refuge with Allah from the anger of Allah and that of His Messenger. 'Umar kept on repeating these words till his (the Prophet's) anger calmed down. Then Umar said: Messenger of Allah, what is the position of one who fasts perpetually? He (ﷺ) said: He neither fasted nor broke it, or he said: He did not fast and he did not break it. 'Umar said: What about him who fasts for two days and does not fast one day? He (ﷺ) said: Is anyone capable of doing that? He ('Umar) said: What is the position of him who fasts for a day and doesn't fast on the other day? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: That is the fast of David (peace be upon him). He ('Umar) said: What about him who fasts one day and doesn't fast for two days. Thereupon he (the Messenger of Allah) said: I wish I were given the strength to do that. Thereafter he (ﷺ) said: Fasting three days every month and that of Ramadan every year is a perpetual fasting. I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of 'Arafa may atone for the sins of the preceding and the coming years, and I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of Ashura may atone for the sins of the preceding year.
1162.02 | Abu Qatada al-Ansari (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked about his fasting. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt annoyed. Thereupon 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) said:We are pleased with Allah as the Lord, with Islam as our Code of Life, with Muhammad as the Messenger and with our pledge (to you for willing and cheerful submission) as a (sacred) commitment. He was then asked about perpetual fasting, whereupon he said: He neither fasted nor did he break it, or he did not fast and he did not break it. He was then asked about fasting for two days and breaking one day. He (the Holy Prophet) said: And who has strength enough to do it? He was asked about fasting for a day and breaking for two days, whereupon he said: May Allah bestow upon us strength to do it. He was then asked about fasting for a day and breaking on the other, whereupon he said: That is the fasting of my brother David (peace be upon him). He was then asked about fasting on Monday, whereupon he said: It was the day on which I was born. on which I was commissioned with prophethood or revelation was sent to me, (and he further) said: Three days' fasting every month and of the whole of Ramadan every year is a perpetual fast. He was asked about fasting on the day of 'Arafa (9th of Dhu'I-Hijja), whereupon he said: It expiates the sins of the preceding year and the coming year.

1161.03 | Imran b. Husain (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said to a person:Did you observe any fast in the middle of this month (Sha'ban)?

He spent one month in devotion. Then he addressed the people on the night he came back (to his residence) and commanded them as Allah desired (him to command) and then said:I used to devote myself (observe i'tikaf) during these ten (nights). Then I started devoting myself in the last ten (nights). And he who desires to observe i'tikaf along with me should spend the night) at his place of i'tikaf. And I saw this night (Lailat-ul-Qadr) but I forgot it (the exact night) ; so seek it;In the last ten nights on odd numbers. I saw (the glimpses of that dream) that I was prostrating in water and mud. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: It rained on the twenty-first night and the water dripped (from the roof) of the mosque at the place where the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed prayer.

He (the Holy Prophet) took hold of that mat and placed it in the nook of the tent. He then put his head out and talked with people and they came near him, and he (the Holy Prophet) said:I observed i'tikaf in the first ten (nights and days) in order to seek that night (Lailat-ul-Qadr). I then observed i'tikaf in the middle ten days. Then (an angel) was sent to me and I was told that this (night) is among the last ten (nights). He who among you likes to observe i'tikaf should do so; and the people observed it along with him, and he (the Holy Prophet) said: That (Lailat-ul-Qadr) was shown to me on an odd (night) and I (saw in the dream) that I was prostrating in the morning in clay and water. So in the morning of the twenty-first night when he (the Holy Prophet) got up for dawn (prayer). there was a rainfall and the mosque dripped, and I saw clay and water.

I said to him: Did you hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) making mention of Lailat-ul-Qadr? He said: Yes, (and added) we were observing i'tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the middle ten days of Ramadan, and came out on the morning of the twentieth and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us and said: I was shown Lailat-ul-Qadr, but I forgot (the exact night) or I was caused to forget it, so seek it in the last ten odd (nights), and I was shown that I was prostrating in water and clay. So he who wanted to observe i'tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) should return (to the place of i'tikaf). He (Abu Sa'id al-Khudri) said: And we returned and did not find any patch of cloud in the sky. Then the cloud gathered and there was (so heavy) a downpour that the roof of the mosque which was made of the branches of date-palms began to drip. Then there was prayer and I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prostrating in water and clay till I saw the traces of clay on his forehead.

Then it was made manifest to him that (Lailat-ul-Qadr) was in the last ten nights (of Ramadan), and commanded to pitch the tent (again). He then came to the people and said: O people, Lailat-ul-Qadr was made manifest to me and I came out to inform you about it that two persons came contending with each other and there was a devil along with them and I forgot it. So seek it in the last ten nights of Ramadan. Seek it on the ninth, on the seventh and on the fifth. I (one of the narrators) said: Abu Sa'id, you know more than us about numbers. He said: Yes, indeed we have better right than you. I said: What is this ninth, seventh, and fifth? He said: When twenty-one (nights are over) and the twenty-second begins, it is the ninth, and when twenty-three (nights) are over, that which follows (the last night) is the seventh, and when twenty-five nights are over, what follows it is fifth. Ibn Khallad said: Instead of the word Yahliqan (contending), he said Yakhtasiman, (they are disputing).

He then took oath (without making any exception, i. e. without saying In sha Allah) that it was the twenty-seventh night. I said to him: Abu Mundhir, on what ground do you say that?

(It was at this juncture) that the revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was covered with a cloth, and Ya'la said: Would that I see revelation coming to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: What would you do in your Hajj? He said: I would take off the clothes and would wash from me this perfume. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What you do in your Hajj do it in your Umra.
1180.03 | Safwan b. Ya'la b. Umayya reported that Ya'la used to say to 'Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him):Would that I see revelation descending upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

'Umar being one of them, there came a person with a cloak of wool on him daubed with perfume and he said: Messenger of Allah, what about the person who entered upon the state of Ihram with a cloak after daubing it with perfume? The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) looked at him for a short while, and then became quiet, and revelation began descending upon him, and 'Umar gestured (with his hand) to Ya'la b. Umayya to come. Ya'la came and he entered his head (beneath the cloth and saw) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with his face red, and breathing heavily. Then he felt relieved (of that burden) and he said: Where is the man who was just asking me about Umra?

He said, Messenger of Allah, I put on Ihram for 'Umra: what should I do? He (the Holy Prophet) kept quiet and did not make him any reply. And 'Umar screened him and it was (usual) with 'Umar that when the revelation descended upon him, he provided him shade (with the help of a piece of cloth). I (the person who came to the Holy Prophet) said: I said to 'Umar I wish to project my head into the cloth (to see how the Prophet receives revelation). So when the revelation began to descend upon him 'Umar wrapped him (the Holy Prophet) with cloth I came to him and projected my head with him into the cloth, and saw him (the Holy Prophet) (receiving the revelation). When he (the Holy Prophet) was relieved (of its burden), he said: Where is the inquirer who was just inquiring about 'Umra? That man came to him.

1211.01 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said:We went with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. We entered into the state of Ihram for Umra. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who has the sacrificial animal with him, he should put on Ihram for Hajj along with Umra. and should not put it off till he has completed them (both Hajj and Umra). She said: When I came to Mecca. I was having menses, I neither circumambulated the House, nor ran between as-safa' and al-Marwa. I complained about it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: Undo your hair, comb it, and pronounce Talbiya for Hajj, and give up Umra (for the time being), which I did. When we had performed the Hajj, the Messenger of Allah (way peace he upon him) sent me with Abd al-Rabman b. Abu Bakr to Tan'im saying: This is the place for your Umra. Those who had put on Ihram for Umra circumambulated the House, and ran between al-safa' and al-Marwa. They then put off Ihram and then made the last circuit after they had returned from Mina after performing their Hajj, but those who had combined the Hajj and the Umra made only one circuit (as they had combined Hajj and 'Umra).
1211.02 | 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said:We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. There were some amongst us who had put on IHram for Umra and there were some who had put on Ihram for Hajj. (We proceeded on till) we came to Mecca. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who put on Ihram for 'Umra but did not bring the sacrificial animal with him should put it off. and he who put on Ihram for Umra and he who had brought the sacrificial animal with him should not put it off until he had slaughtered the animal; and he who put on lhram for Hajj should complete it. A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: I was in the monthlyperiod, and I remained In this state till the day of 'Arafa, and I had entered into the state of Ihram for 'Umra. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) thus commanded me to undo my hair and comb them (again) and enter into the state of Ihram for Hajj, and abandon (the rites of 'Umra). She ('A'isha) said: I did so, and when I had completed my Pilgrimage, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent with me 'Abd al-Rabman b. Abu Bakr and commanded me to (resume the rites of) 'Umra at Tan'im. the place where (I abandoned) 'Umra and put on Ihram for Hajj (before completing Umra).
1211.03 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:We went with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. I put on Ihram for Umra and did not bring the sacrificial animal. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who has the sacrihcial animal with him should enter into the state of Ihram for Hajj along with 'Umra, and. he should not put the Ihram off till he has completed both of them. She (Hadrat A'isha) said: The monthly period began. When it was the night of Arafa, I said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): I entered into the state of Ihram for 'Umra. but now how should I perform the Hajj? Thereupon he said: Undo your hair and comb them, and desist from performing Umra, and put on Ihram for Hajj She (A'isha, said: When I had completed my Hajj he commanded 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr to carry me behind him (on boneback) in order to enable me to resume the rituals of Umra from Tan'im, the place where I abandoned its rituals.
1211.04 | `A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:'We went with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (to Mecca). He said: He who intended among you to put on Ihram for Hajj and `Umra should do so. And he who intended to put on Ihram for Hajj may do so. And he who intended to put on Ihram for `Umra only may do so. `A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) put on Ihram for Hajj and some people did that along with him. And some people put on Ihram for `Umra and Hajj (both), and some persons put on Ihram for `Umra only, and I was among those who put on Ihram for `Umra (only).
1211.05 | `A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:We went with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (in his) Farewell Pilgrimage near the time of the appearance of the new moon of Dhul-Hijja. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who amongst you intends to put on Ihram for `Umra may do so; had I not brought sacrificial animals along with me, I would have put on Ihram for `Umra. She (further said). There were some persons who put on Ihram for `Umra, and some persons who put on Ihram for Hajj, and I was one of those who put on Ihram for `Umra. We went on till we reached Mecca, and on the day of `Arafa I found myself in a state of menses, but I did not put off the Ihram for `Umra. I told about (this state of mine) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), whereupon he said: Abandon your `Umra, and undo the hair of your head and comb (them), and put on Ihram for Hajj. She (`A'isha) said: I did accordingly. When it was the night at Hasba and Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj, he (the Holy Prophet) sent with me `Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr, and he mounted me behind him on his camel and took me to Tan`im and I put on Ihram for `Umra, and thus Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj and `Umra and (we were required to observe) neither sacrifice nor alms nor fasting.
1211.06 | `A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said:We set out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) just at the appearance of the new moon of Dhul- Hijja. We had no other intention but that of performing the Hajj, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who among you intends to put on Ihram for `Umra should do so for `Umra. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1211.07 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:We went with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the appearance of the new moon of Dhu'l-Hijja. There were amongst us those who had put on Ihram for Umra, and those also who had put on Ihram both for Hajj and Umra, and still those who had put on Ihram for Hajj (alone). I was one of those who had put on Ihram for. Umra (only). 'Urwa (one of the narrators) said: Allah enabled her (A'isha) to complete both Hajj and Umra (according to the way as mentioned above). Hisham (one of the narrators) said: She had neither the sacrificial animal nor (was she required to) fast, nor (was she obliged to give) alms.
1211.08 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said:We proceeded with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. There were those amongst us who had put on Ihram for Umra, and those who had put on Ihram both for Hajj and" Umra, and those amongst us who had put on Ihram for Hajj (only), while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had put on Ihram for Hajj (only). He who put on Ihram for Umra put it off (after performing Umra), and he who had put on Ihram for Hajj or for both Hajj and 'Umra did not put it off before the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu'l-Hijja).
1211.09 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said:We proceeded with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with no other intention but that of performing the Hajj. As I was at Sarif or near it, I entered in the state of menses. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) came to me and I was weeping, whereupon he said: Are you in a state of menses? I said. Yes. whereupon he said: This is what Allah has ordained for all the daughters, of Adam. Do whatever the pilgrim does. except that you should not circumambulate the House till you have washed yourself (at the end of the menses period). And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered sacrifice of a cow on behalf of his wives.
1211.10 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:We went with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with no other aim but that of Hajj till we came (to the place known as) Sarif; and there I entered in the state of menses. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to me while I was weeping. He said: What makes you weep? I said: Would that I had not come (for Pilgrimage) this year. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What has happened to you? You have perhaps entered the period of menses. I said: Yes. He said: This is what has been ordained for the daughters of Adam. Do what a pilgrim does except that you should not circumambulate the House, till you are purified (of the menses). She ('A'isha) said: When I came to Mecca, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to his companions: Make this (Ihram) the Ihram for 'Umra. So the people put off Ihram except those who had sacrificial animals with them. She ('A'isha) said: The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) had the sacrificial animal with him, and so had Abu Bakr, 'Umar and other persons of means. They (those who had put off Ihram again) put on Ihram (for Hajj) when they marched (towards Mina), and it was the 8th of Dhu'l-Hijja. She ('A'isha) said: When it was the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu'l-Hijja), I was purified, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded me and I did the circumambulation of Ifada. She said that the flesh of cow was sent to us. I said: What is it? They said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has offered a cow as sacrifice on behalf of his wives. When it was the night at Hasba, I said: Messenger of Allah, people are coming back from Hajj and Umra, where as I am coming back from Hajj (alone). She (A'isha) reported: He (the Holy Prophet) commanded" Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr to mount me upon his camel behind him. She ('A'isha) said: I was very young and I well remember that I dozed off and my face touched the hind part of the haudaj (camel litter) till we came to Tan'im, and entered into the state of Ihram in lieu of Umra (which I for the time being abandoned) and which the people had performed.
1211.11 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:We entered into the state of. Ihram for Hajj till we were at Sarif and I was in menses. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to me and I was weeping. The rest of the hadith is the same but (with this portion) that there were sacrificial animals with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and with Abu Bakr, Umar and with rich persons. And they pronounced Talbiya as they proceeded on. And there is no mention of this (too):" I was a girl of tender age and I dozed off and my face touched the bind part of the Haudaj."
1211.12 | 'A'Isha reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered into the state of Ihram for Hajj Afrad.
1211.13 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:We proceeded with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) putting on the Ihram for Hajj during the months of Hajj and the night of Hajj till we encamped at Sarif. He (the Holy Prophet) went to his Companions and said: He who has no sacrificial animal with him, in his case I wish that he should perform Umra (with this Ihram), and he who has the sacrificial animal with him should not do it. So some of them performed Hajj whereas others who had no sacrificial animals with them did not do (Hajj, but performed only 'Umra). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had a sacrificial animal with him and those too who could afford it (performed) Hajj). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to me (i. e. A'isha) while I was weeping, and he said: What makes you weep? I said: I heard your talk with Companions about Umra. He said: What has happened to you? I said: I do not observe prayer (due to the monthly period), whereupon he said: It would not harm you; you should perform (during this time) the rituals of Hajj (which you can do outside the House). Maybe Allah will compensate you for this. You are one among the daughters of Adam and Allah has ordained for you as He has ordained for them. So I proceeded on (with the rituals of Hajj) till we came to Mina. I washed myself and then circumambulated the House, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) encamped at Muhassab and called, Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr. and said: Take out your sister from the precincts of the Ka'ba in order to put on Ihram for Umra and circumambulate the House. and I shall wait for you here. She said: So I went out and put on Ihram and then circumambulated the House, and (ran) between al-Safa and al-Marwa, and then we came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was in his house in the middle of the night. He said: Have you completed your (rituals)? I said: Yes. He then announced to his Companions to march on. He came out, and went to the House and circumambulated it before the dawn prayer and then proceeded to Medina.
1211.14 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said:Some among us put on Ihram for Hajj alone (Hajj Mufrad) ; some of us for Hajj and Umra together (Qiran), and some of us for Tamattal (first for Umra and after completing it for Hajj).
1211.15 | AI-Qasim b. Muhammad reported that A'isha had come for Hajj.
1211.16 | 'Umra reported:I heard A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) as saying: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) five days before the end of Dhi Qa'dah, and we did see but that he intended to perform Hajj (only), but as we came near Mecca the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded that he who did not have the sacrificial animal with him should put off Ihram after circumambulating the House and running between al-Safa and aI-Marwa (and thus convert his Ihram from that of Hajj to 'Umra). 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: The flesh of cow was sent to us on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu'I-Hijja). I said. What is this? It was said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sacrificed (the cow) on behalf of his wives. Yahya said: I made a mention of this hadith (what has been stated by Umra) to Qasim b. Muhammad, whereupon be said: By Allah, she has rightly narrated it to you.
1211.17 | This hadlth has been narrated by Yahya through the same chain of transmitters.
1211.18 | AI-Qasim narrated from the Mother of the Believers (Hadrat 'A'isha) that she said:Messenger of Allah. the people return (from Mecca) having done two worships (both Hajj and Umra), but I am coming back with one (only). whereupon he said: You should wait and when the period of menses is over, you should go to Tan'im and put on lhram and then meet us at such and such time (and I think he said tomorrow) ; and (the reward of this Umra) is for you equal to your hardship or your spending.
1211.19 | Ibn al-Muththanna reported on the authority of Ibn Abu'Adi who transmitted on the authority of Ibn'Aun who narrated from al-Qasim and Ibrahim having said:I cannot differentiate the hadith of one from the other (Qasim and Ibrahim) that the Mother of the Believers (Allah be pleased with her) said this: Messenger of Allah, people have come back with two acts of worship. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1211.20 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:We went with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we did not see but that he (intended to perform) Hajj (only), but when we reached Mecca we circumambulated the House; and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded that he who did not have with him a sacrificial animal should put off Ihram. She (A'isha) said: (And consequently) those who did not bring the sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram; and among his wives (too) who had not brought the sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram. A'isha said: I entered my period and could not (therefore) circumambulate the House. When it was the night of Hasba she said: Messenger of Allah, people are coming back (after having performed both) Hajj and'Umra, whereas I am coming back only with Hajj, whereupon he said: Did you not circumambulate (the Ka'ba) that very night we entered Mecca? She (A'isha) said: No, whereupon he said: Go along with your brother to Tan'im and put on the Ihram for Umra, and it is at such and such a place that you can meet (us). (In the meanwhile) Safiyya (the wife of the Holy Prophet) said: I think, I will detain you (since I have entered in the monthly) period and you shall have to wait for me for the farewell circuit). Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: May you be wounded and your head shorn did you not circumambulate on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu'l-Hijja)? She said: Yes. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no harm. You should go forward. 'A'isha said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was going upwards to the side of Mecca, whereas I was coming down from it, or I was going upward, whereas he was coming down. Isbiq said: She was climbing down, and he was climbing down.
1211.21 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased, with her) reported:We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pronouncing Talbiya having no explicit intention of Pilgrimage or 'Umra. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1211.22 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out on the 4th or 5th of Dhul'I-Hijja (for Pilgrimage to Mecca) and came to me, and he was very angry. I said:Messenger of Allah, who has annoyed you? May Allah cast him in fire I He said: Don't you know that I commanded the people to do an act, but they are hesitant. (Hakam said: I think that he said: They seem to be hesitant.) And if I were to know my affair before what I had to do subsequently, I would not have brought with me the sacrificial animals, and would have bought them (at Mecca) and would have put off lhram as others have done.
1211.23 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out (for Pilgrimage) on The 4th or 5th of Dbu'l Hjjja. The rest of the hadith is the same, but he (the narrator) made no mention of the doubt of Hakam about his (the Prophet's) words:" They were reluctant."
1211.24 | A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that she put on Ihram for, Umra and arrived 'at Mecca) but did not circumambulate the House as she had entered in the period of menses, and then put on Ihram for Hajj and performed all the rituals concerning it (except circumambulating the House). The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said to her on the day of march (when pilgrims come to Mina):Your circumambulation would suffice both Hajj and Umra. She, however, felt reluctant. Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) sent her with 'Abd al-Rahman to Tan'im and she performed Umra (with separate rituals) after Hajj.
1211.25 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that she entered in the monthly period at Sarif, and took bath at 'Arafa (after the period was over). The messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her:Your circumambulation between al Safa and al-Marwa is enough for your Hajj and 'Umra.
1211.26 | Safiyya bint Shaiba reported that 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said:Messenger of Allah, the people are returning with two rewards whereas I am returning with one reward. Thereupon he commanded 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr to take her to al-Tan'im. She ('A'isha) said: He seated me behind him on his camel. She (further) stated: I lifted my head covering and took it off from my neck. He struck my foot as if he was striking the camel. I said to him: Do you find anyone bere? She (further) said: I entered into the state of Ihram for 'Umra till we reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was at Hasba.
1212 | Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered him to mount A'isha behind him and enable her to (enter into the state of Ihram for 'Umra) at Tan'im.
1213.01 | Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said:We, in the state of lhram, came with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for Hajj Mufrad (with the aim of Hajj only), and 'A'isha set out for Umra, and when we reached Sarif, she (Hadrat A'isha) entered in the state of monthly period; we proceeded on till we reached (Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka'ba and ran between (al-Safa) and al-Marwa; and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded that one who amongst us had no sacrificial animal with him should put off Ihram. We said: What does this "putting off" imply? He said: Getting out completely from the state of lhram, (so we put off Ihram), and we turned to our wives and applied perfume and put on our clothes. and we were at a four night's distance from 'Arafa. And we again put on Ihram on the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and found her weeping, and said: What is the matter with you? She said: The matter is that I have entered in the monthly period, and the people had put off lhram, but I did not and I did not circumambulate the House, and the people are going for Hajj now (but I can't go), whereupon he said: It is the matter which Allah has ordained for the daughters of Adam, so now take a bath and put on Ihram for Hajj. She ('A'isha) did accordingly, and stayed at the places of staying till the monthly period was over. She then circumambulated the House, and (ran between) al-Safa and al-Marwa. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: Now both your Hajj and 'Umra are complete, whereupon she said: I feel in my mind that I did not circumambulate the House till I performed Hajj (I missed the circumambulation of 'Umra). Thereupon he (Allah's Apostle) said: 'Abd al-Rahman, take her to Tan'im (so as to enable her) to perform Umra (separately), and it was the night at Hasba.
1213.02 | Jabir b. Abdullah is reported to have said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and she was weeping. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1213.03 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported that A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) entered into the state of Ihram (separately) for 'Umra while the Prophet (ﷺ) was performing Hajj. The rest of the hadith is the same, but with this addition:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was a person of gentle disposition, so when she (A'Isha) wished for a thing, he accepted it (provided it did not contravene the teachings of Islam). So he (in pursuance of her desire for a separate lhram for Umra) sent her with 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr and she put on Ihram for 'Umra at al-Tan'im. Matar and Abu Zubair (the two narrators amongst the chain of transmitters) said: Whenever 'A'isha performed Hajj she did as she had done along with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ).
1213.04 | Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said.:We went with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in 'a state of Ihram for the Hajj. There were women and children with us. When we reached Mecca we circumambulated the House and (ran) between al-Safa and al-Marwa. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who has no sacrificial animal with him should put off lhram. We said: What kind of putting off? He said: Getting out of lhram completely. So we came to our wives, and put on our clothes and applied perfume. When it was the day of Tarwiya, we put on Ihram for Hajj. and the first circumambulation and (running) between al-Safa and al-Marwa sufficed us.. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded us to become seven partners (in the sacrifice) of a camel and a cow.
1214 | Jabir b. Abdullah reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered us to put on Ihram (again) as we proceeded towards Mina after we had put it off (i. e. 'on the 8th of Dhu'l-Hijja). So we pronounced Talbiya at al-Abtah.
1215 | Jabir b. Abdullah is reported to have said:Neither Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) nor his Companions (circumambulated the Ka'ba and) ran between al-Safa and al-Marwa but once (sufficing both for Hajj and 'Umra). But in the hadith transmitted by Muhammad b. Bakr there is an addition:" That is first circumambulation."
1216.01 | 'Ata'reported:I, along with some people, heard Jabir b. 'Abdullah saying: We the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) put on Ihram for Hajj only. Ata' further said that Jabir stated: Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came on the 4th of Dhu'l-Hijja and he commanded us to put off Ihram. 'Ata'said that he (Allah's Apostle) commanded them to put off Ihram and to go to their wives (for intercourse). 'Ata' said: It was not obligatory for them, but (intercourse) with them had become permissible. We said: When only five days had been left to reach 'Arafa, he (the Holy Prophet) commanded us to have intercourse with our wives. And we reached 'Arafa in a state as if we had just had intercourse (with them). He ('Ata') said: Jabir pointed with his hand and I (perceive) as if I am seeing his hand as it moved. In the (meantime) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood amongst us and said: You are well aware that I am the most God-fearing, most truthful and most pious amongst you. And if there were not sacrificial animals with me, I would also have put off Ihram as you have put off. And if I were to know this matter of mine what I have come to know later on, I would not have brought sacrificial animals with me. So they (the Companions) put off Ihram and we also put it off and listened to (the Holy Prophet) and obeyed (his command). Jabir said: 'Ali came with the revenue of the taxes (from Yemen). He (the Holy Prophet) said: For what (purpose) have you entered into the state of Ihram (whether you entered into the state purely for Hajj and, Umra jointly or Hajj and Umra separately)? He said: For the purpose for which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had entered. (The Prophet had entered as a Qiran, i.e. Ihram covering both Umra and Hajj simultaneously.) Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Offer a sacrifice of animal, and retain Ihram. And 'Ali brought a sacrificial animal for him (for the Holy Prophet). Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju'shum said: Messenger of Allah, is it (this concession putting off Ihram of Hajj or Umra) meant for this year or is it forever? He said: It is forever.
1216.02 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:We entered with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the state of Ihram for Hajj. When we came to Mecca he commanded us to put off Ihram and make it for 'Umra. We felt it (the command) hard for us, and our hearts were anguished on account of this and it (this reaction of the people) reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We do not know whether he received (this news) from the Heaven (through revelation) or from the people. (Whatever the case might be) he said; O people, put off Ihram. If there were not the sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as you do. So we put off the Ihram (after performing Umra), and we had intercourse with our wives and did everything which a non-Muhrim does (applying perfume, putting on clothes, etc.), and when It was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja) we turned our back to Mecca (in order to go to Mini, 'Arafat) and we put on lhram for Hajj.
1216.03 | Musa b. Nafi reported:I came to Mecca as a Mutamattil for Umra (performing Umra first and then putting off Ihram and again entering into the state of Ihram for Hajj) four days before the day of Tarwiya (i. e. on the 4th of Dhu'l-Hijja). Thereupon the people said: Now yours is the Hajj of the Meccans. I went to 'Ata' b. Abi Rabah and asked his religious verdict. Ata' said: Jabir b. 'Abdullah al'Ansari (Allah be pleased with them) narrated to me that he performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the year when he took sacrificial animals with him (i.e. during the 10th year of Hijra known as the Farewell Pilgrimage) and they had put on Ihram for Hajj only (as Mufrid). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Put off Ihram and circumambulate the House, and (run) between al-Safa and al-Marwa, and get your hair cut and stay as non-Muhrims. When it was the day of Tarwiya, then put on Ihram for Hajj and make lhram for Mut'a (you had put on Ihram for Hajj, but take it off after performing Umra and then again put on Ihram for Hajj). They said: How should we make it Mut'a although we entered upon lhram in the name of Hajj? He said: Do whatever I command you to do. Had I not brought sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as I have commanded you to do. But it is not permissible for me to put off Ihram till the sacrifice is offered. Then they also did accordingly.
1216.04 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:We set out with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as Muhrim for Hajj. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to make this Ihram for Umra, and some put it off (after performing 'Umra), but the Prophet (ﷺ) had sacrificial animals with him, so he could not make it (this Ihram) as that of Umra.
1217.01 | Abu Nadra reported:Ibn 'Abbas commanded the performance of Mut'a putting ihram for 'Umra during the months of Dhul-Hijja and after completing it. then putting on Ihram for Hajj), but Ibn Zubair forbade to do it. I made a mention of it to Jabir b. Abdullih and he said: It is through me that this hadith has been circulated. We entered into the state of Ihram as Tamattu' with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When 'Umar was Installed as Caliph, he said: Verily Allah made permissible for His Messenger (ﷺ) whatever He liked and as Re liked. And (every command) of the Holy Qur'an has been revealed for every occasion. So accomplish Hajj and Umra for Allah as Allah has commanded you; and confirm by (proper conditions) the marriage of those women (with whom you have performed Mut'a). And any person would come to me with a marriage of appointed duration (Mut'a), I would stone him (to death).
1217.02 | Qatada narrated this hadith with the same chain of transmitters saying:(That 'Umar also said): Separate your Hajj from 'Umra, for that is the most complete Hajj, and complete your Umra.
1216.05 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:We came with the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) pronouncing Talbiya for Hajj, and the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) commanded us to make (our Ihram) into that of Umra.
1218.01 | Ja'far b Muhammad reported on the authority of his father:We went to Jabir b. Abdullah and he began inquiring about the people (who had gone to see him) till it was my turn. I said: I am Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Husain. He placed his hand upon my head and opened my upper button and then the lower one and then placed his palm on my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during those days, a young boy, and he said: You are welcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want to ask. And I asked him but as he was blind (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer came. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he placed its ends upon his shoulders they slipped down on account of being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on the clothes rack near by. And he led us in the prayer. I said to him: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah's Messenger (May peace be upon him). And he pointed with his hand nine, and then stated: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj, then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was about to perform the Hajj. A large number of persons came to Medina and all of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and do according to his doing. We set out with him till we reached Dhu'l-Hulaifa. Asma' daughter of Umais gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr. She sent message to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) asking him: What should 1 do? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts and put on Ihram. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) then prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida'. And I saw as far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians, and also on my right and on my left and behind me like this. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was prominent among us and the (revelation) of the Holy Qur'an was descending upon him. And it is he who knows (its true) significance. And whatever he did, we also did that. He pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying):" Labbaik,0 Allah, Labbaik, Labbaik. Thou hast no partner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou hast no partner." And the people also pronounced this Talbiya which they pronounce (today). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of Allah (May peace. be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiya. Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only, being unaware of the Umra (at that season), but when we came with him to the House, he touched the pillar and (made seven circuits) running three of them and walking four. And then going to the Station of Ibrahim, he recited:" And adopt the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer." And this Station was between him and the House. My father said (and I do not know whether he had made a mention of it but that was from Allah's Apostle [May peace be upon him] that he recited in two rak'ahs:" say: He is Allah One," and say:" Say: 0 unbelievers." He then returned to the pillar (Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to al-Safa' and as he reached near it he recited:" Al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by Allah," (adding: ) I begin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first mounted al-Safa' till he saw the House, and facing Qibla he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said:" There is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is the Sovereignty. to Him praise is due. and He is Powerful over everything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone." He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at al-Safa'. And when it was his last running at al-Marwa he said: If I had known beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have performed an 'Umra. So, he who among you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off Ihram and treat it as an Umra. Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju'sham got up and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present year, or does it apply forever? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into another and said twice: The 'Umra has become incorporated in the Hajj (adding):" No, but for ever and ever." 'All came from the Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (May peace be upon him) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one among those who had put off Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and had applied antimony. He (Hadrat'Ali) showed disapproval to it, whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. He (the narrator) said that 'Ali used to say in Iraq: I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) showing annoyance at Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding what she had narrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her, whereupon he said: She has told the truth, she has told the truth. (The Prophet then asked 'Ali): What did you say when you undertook to go for Hajj? I ('Ali) said: 0 Allah, I am putting on Ihram for the same purpose as Thy Messenger has put it on. He said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the Ihram. He (Jabir) said: The total number of those sacrificial animals brought by 'Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Apostle (ﷺ) was one hundred. Then all the people except the Apostle (ﷺ) and those who had with them sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair clipped; when it was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Ailah (ﷺ) rode and led the noon, afternoon, sunset 'Isha' and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the sun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be pitched at Namira. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then set out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at al-Mash'ar al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), however, passed on till he came to 'Arafa and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namira. There he got down till the sun had passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be brought and saddled for him. Then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours. Behold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is under my feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance. The first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi'a b. al-Harith, who was nursed among the tribe of Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. And the usury of she pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have right over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold fast to it, you would never go astray. And you would be asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell me) what would you say? They (the audience) said: We will bear witness that you have conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people (said):" O Allah, be witness. 0 Allah, be witness," saying it thrice. (Bilal then) pronounced Adhan and later on Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the noon prayer. He (Bilal) then uttered Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then mounted his camel and came to the place of stay, making his she-camel al-Qaswa, turn towards the side where there we are rocks, having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and faced the Qibla. He kept standing there till the sun set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He made Usama sit behind him, and he pulled the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he pointed out to the people with his right hand to be moderate (in speed), and whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel) till she climbed up and this is how he reached al-Muzdalifa. There he led the evening and 'Isha prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamas and did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i. e. he did not observe supererogatory rak'ahs between Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then lay down till dawn and offered the dawn prayer with an Adhan and Iqama when the morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa, and when he came to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, he faced towards Qibla, supplicated Him, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness (La ilaha illa Allah) and Oneness, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl b. 'Abbas and he was a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome face. As the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was moving on, there was also going a group of women (side by side with them). Al-Fadl began to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) placed his hand on the face of Fadl who then turned his face to the other side, and began to see, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned his hand to the other side and placed it on the face of al-Fadl. He again turned his face to the other side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir. 1680 He urged her (al-Qaswa) a little, and, following the middle road, which comes out at the greatest jamra, he came to the jamra which is near the tree. At this be threw seven small pebbles, saying Allah-o-Akbar while throwing every one of them in a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown (with the help of fingers) and this he did in the bottom of the valley. He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand. Then he gave the remaining number to 'All who sacrificed them, and he shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of flesh from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Prophet and Hadrat 'All) took some meat out of it and drank its soup. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) again rode and came to the House, and offered the Zuhr prayer at Mecca. He came to the tribe of Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water. O Bani 'Abd al-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it along with you. So they handed him a basket and he drank from it.
1218.02 | Ja'far b. Muhammad narrated on the authority of his father thus:I came to Jabir b. Abdullah and asked him about the (Farewell) Pilgrimage of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The rest of the hadith is the same, but with the addition of this:" There was one Abu Sayyara among the Arabs, (of pre-Islamic period) who carried (people from Muzdalifa to Mini). As the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) set out from Muzdalifa to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, the Quraish were certain that he would halt there and that would be his station. But he passed on (without staying) there. and paid no heed to it till he came to 'Arafat and there he stayed."
1218.03 | Jabir reported Allah's Messenger (May peace be upon him) as saying:I have sacrificed (the animals) here, and the whole of Mini is a place for sacrifice; so sacrifice your animals at your places. 1 have stayed here (near these rocks), and the whole of Arafat is a place for stay. And I have stayed here (at Muzdalifa near Mash'ar al-Haram and the whole of Muzdalifa) is a place for stay (i. e. one is permitted to spend night in any part of it, as one likes).
1218.04 | Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported that when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) proceeded to Mecca, he came to it (the Black Stone). he kissed it. and moved to his right. and moved quickly in three circuits, and walked in four circuits.
1219.01 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Quraish (of the pre-Islamic days) and those who followed their religions practices stayed at Muzdalifa, and they named themselves as Hums, whereas all other Arabs stayed at 'Arafa. With the advent of Islam, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, commanded His Apostle (ﷺ) to come to 'Arafat and stay there, and then hurry from there, and this is the significance of the words of Allah:" Then hasten on from where the people hasten on."
1219.02 | Hisham narrated on the authority of his father that the Arabs with the exception of Hums who were Quraish, and their descendants, circumambulated the House naked. They kept circumambulating In this state of nudity unless the Hums supplied to them the clothes. The male provided (clothes) to the male and the female provided clothes to the female. And the Hums did not get out of Muzdalifa, whereas the people (other than the Quraish) went t o 'Arafat. Hisham said on the authority of his father who related from 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) who said:Hums are those about whom Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" Then hasten to where the people hasten." She (further) said: The people hastened on from 'Arafat, whereas Hums hastened from Muzdalifa, and said: We'do not hasten but from Haram. But when this (verse) was revealed:" Hasten on from that (place) where the people hasten on," they (the Quraish) then went to 'Arafat.
1220 | Jubair. b. Mut'im reported:I lost my camel and went in search of it on the day of 'Arafa, and I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) staying along with people in 'Ara'fit. Thereupon I said: By Allah, he is among the Hums (Quraish) ; what has happened to him that he has come to this (place)? The Quraish were counted among Hums.
1221.01 | Abu Musa (Allah be pleased with him) said:I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as he was encamping at Batha. He said to me: Did you intend to perform Hajj? I said: Yes. He again said: With what intention have you entered into the state of Ihram (for Ifrad, Qiran or Tamattu'). I said: I pronounced Talbiya (I have entered into the state of Ihram ) with that very aim with which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is pronouncing Talbiya. He (the Holy Prophet) said; You have done well. Then circumambulate the House and run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa' and put off Ihram (as you have not brought the sacrificial animals along with you). So I circumambulated the House, and ran between al-Safa' and al-Marwa' and then came to a woman of the tribe of Qais and she rid my head of the lice. I again put on Ihram for Hajj. and continued giving religious verdict (according to this practice) till during the Caliphate of Umar (Allah be pleased with him) when a person said to him: Abu Musa, or Abdullah b. Qais, exercise restraint in delivering some religious verdict of yours, for you do not know what has been introduced after you by the Commander of the Believers in the rites (of Hajj). Thereupon he said: 0 people, whom we gave the religious verdict (concerning putting off Ihram ) they should wait, for the Commander of the Believers is about to come to you, and you should follow him. Umar (Allah be pleased with him) then came and I made a mention of it to him. whereupon he said: If we abide by the Book of Allah (we find) the Book of Allah has commanded us to complete the (. Hajj and 'Umra), and if we abide by the Sunnah of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), we find that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not put off Ihram till the sacrificial animal was brought to its end (till it was sacrificed).
1221.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters.
1221.03 | Abu Musa (Allah be pleased with him) reported:I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was encamping at Batha. He (the Holy Prophet) said: With what purpose have you entered into the state of Ihram? I said: I have entered into the state of Ihram in accordance with the Ihram of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). He said: Have you brought sacrificial animals along with you? I said: No. whereupon he said: Then circumambulate the House and run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa and put off Ihram. So I circumambulated the House, ran between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, and then came to a woman of my tribe. She combed and washed my head. I used to give religious verdict (according to the above mentioned command of the Holy Prophet) during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and also during that of 'Umar. And it was during the Hajj season that a person came to me and said: You (perhaps) do not know what the Commander of the Believers has introduced in the rites (of Hajj). I said: 0 people, those whom we have given religious verdict about a certain thing should wait, for the Commander of the Believers is about to arrive among you, so follow him. When the Commander of the Believers arrived, I said: What is this that you have introduced in the rites (of Hajj)? -where upon he said: If we abide by the Book of Allah (we find) that there Allah, Exalted and Majestic, has said: Complete Hajj and 'Umra for Allah." And if we abide by the Sunnah of our Apostle (ﷺ) (we find) that the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) did not put off Ihram till he had sacrificed the animals.
1221.04 | Abu Musa (Allah be pleased with him) reported:The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon im) had sent me to Yemen and I came back In the year in which he (the Holy Prophet) performed the (Farewell) Pilgrimage. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon, him) said to me: Abu Musa, what did you ' say when you entered into the state of Ihram? I said: At thy beck and call; my (Ihram) is that of the Ihram of Allah's Apostle (May peace be upon him). He said: Have you brought the sacrificial animals? I said: No. Thereupon he said: Go and circumambulate the House, and (run) between al-Safa' and al-Marwa and then put off Ihram. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1222 | Abu Musa, (Allah be pleased with him) reported that he used to deliver religious verdict in favor of Hajj Tamattu'. A person said to him:Exercise restraint in delivering some of your religious verdicts, for you do not know what the Commander of Believers has introduced in the rites (of Hajj) after you (when you were away in Yemen). He (Abu Musa, ) met him (Hadrat Umar) subsequently and asked him (about it), whereupon 'Umar said: I know that Allah's Apostle (May peace be upon him) and also his Companions did that (observed Tamattu'), but I do not approve that the married persons should have intercourse with their wives under the shade of the trees, and then set out for Hajj with water trickling down from their heads.
1223.01 | 'Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported that 'Uthman (Allah be pleased with him) used to forbid Tamattu', whereas 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) ordered to do it. 'Uthman said a word to 'Ali, but 'Ali said:You know that we used to perform Tamattu' with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), whereupon he said: It is right, but we entertained fear.
1223.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters.
1223.03 | Sa'id b. al-Musayyab reported that 'Ali and 'Uthman (Allah be pleased with them) met at 'Usfan; and Uthman used to forbid (people) from performing Tamattu' and 'Umra (during the period of Hajj), whereupon 'Ali said:What is your opinion about a matter which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did but you forbid it? Thereupon Uthman said: You leave us alone, whereupon he ('Ali) said: I cannot leave you alone. When 'Ali saw this, he put on Ihram for both of them together (both for Hajj and 'Umra).
1224.01 | Abu Dharr (Allah be pleased with him) said that Tamattu' in Hajj was a special (concession) only for the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ).
1224.02 | Abu Dharr (Allah be pleased with him) reported:Tamattu' in Hajj was a special concession for us.
1224.03 | Abu Dharr (Allah be pleased with him) said:Two are the Mut'as which were not permissible but only for us, i. e. temporary marriage with women and Tamattu' in Hajj.
1224.04 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abi al-Sha'tha' reported:I came to Ibrahim al-Nakha'I and Ibrahim Taimi and said: I intend to combine 'Umra and Hajj this year, whereupon Ibrahim al-Nakha'i said: But your father did not make such intention. Ibrahim narrated on the authority of, his father that he passed by Abu Dharr (Allah be pleased with him) at Rabdha, and made a mention of that, whereupon he said: It was a special concession for us and not for you.
1225.01 | Ghunaim b. Qais said:I asked Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas (Allah be pleased with him) about Mut'a, whereupon he said: We did that, and it was the day when he was an unbeliever living in (one of the) houses of Mecca.
1225.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sulaiman Taimi with the same chain of transmitters and in his narration (he) refers to Mu'awiya.
1225.03 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Sulaiman (but with a slight modification of words).
1226.01 | Mutarrif reported:'Imran b. Husain said to me: Should I not narrate to you a hadith today by which Allah will benefit you subsequently-and bear in mind that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made some members of his family perform 'Umra within ten days of Dhu'l-Hijja. No verse was revealed to abrogate that, and he (the Holy Prophet) did not refrain from doing it till he died. So after him everyone said as he liked, (but it would be his. personal opinion and not the verdict of the Shari'ah).
1226.02 | This hadith been narrated on the authority of Jurairi with the same chain of transmitters, and Ibn Hatim said in his narration:" A person said according to his personal opinion, and it was Umar."
1226.03 | Imran b. Husain reported:I am narrating to you a hadith by which Allah will benefit you (and the hadith is) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) combined Hajj and 'Umra, and he did not forbid (this combination) till he died. (Moreover) nothing was revealed in the Holy Qur'an which forbade it. And I was always blessed till I was branded and then it (blessing) was abandoned. I then abandoned branding and it (the blessing was restored).
1226.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Mutarrif with the same chain of transmitters.
1226.05 | Mutarrif reported:'Imran b. Husain sent for me during his illness of which he died, and said: I am narrating to you some ahadith which may benefit you after me. If I live you conceal (the fact that these have been transmitted by me), and if I die, then you narrate them if you like (and these are): I am blessed, and bear in mind that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) combined Hajj and Umra. Then no verse was revealed in regard to it in the Book of Allah (which abrogated it) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not forbid (from doing it). And whatever a person (, Umar) said was out of his personal opinion.
1226.06 | 'Imran b. al-Husain (Allah be pleased with him) said:Know well that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) combined 'Hajj and 'Umra, and nothing was revealed in the Book (to abrogate it), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) too did not forbid us from (combining) them. And whatever a person said was out of his personal opinion.
1226.07 | 'Imran b. Husain (Allah be pleased with him) reported:We performed Tamattu' (Hajj and 'Umra combining together) in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and nothing was revealed in the Qur'an (concerning the abrogation of this practice), and whatever a person (Hadhrat 'Umar) said was his personal opinion. 'Imran b. Husain narrated this hadith (in these words also):" Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) performed Hajj Tamattu' and we also performed it along with him."
1226.09 | 'Imran b. Husain said:There was revealed the verse of Tamattu' in Hajj in the Book of Allah and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to perform it. and then no verse was revealed abrogating the Tamattu' (form of Hajj), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not forbid to do it till he died. So whatever a person said was his personal opinion.
1226.10 | A hadith like this is transmitted on the authority of Imran b. Husain, but with this variation that he ('Imran) said:We did that (Tamattu') in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he did not say anything but he (the Holy Prophet) commanded us to do it.
1227 | Abdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) observed Tamattu' in Hajjat-ul-Wada'. He first put on Ihram for 'Umra and then for Hajj. and then offered animal sacrifice. So he drove the sacrificial animals with him from Dhu'l-Hulaifa. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commenced Ihram of Umra and thus pronounced Talbiya for 'Umra. and then (put on Ihram for Hajj) and pronounced Talbiya for Hajj. And the people performed Tamattu' in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). They put on Ihram for Umra (first) and then for Hajj. Some of them had sacrificial animals which they had brought with them, whereas some of them had none to sacrifice. So when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to Mecca, he said to the people: He who amongst you has brought sacrificial animals along with him must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for him till he has completed the Hajj; and he, who amongst you has not brought the sacrificial animals should circumambulate the House, and run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa and clip (his hair) and put off the Ihram, and then again put on the Ihram for Hajj and offer sacrifice of animals. But he who does not find the sacrificial animal, he should observe fast for three days during the Hajj and for seven days when he returns to his family. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) circumambulated (the House) when he came to Mecca: he first kissed the corner (of the Ka'ba containing the Black Stone), then ran in three circuits out of seven and walked in four circuits. And then when he had finished the circumambulation of the House he observed two rak'ahs of prayer at the Station (of Ibrahim), and then pronounced Salaam (for concluding the rak'ahs), and departed and came to al-Safa' and ran seven times between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful till he had completed his Hajj and sacrificed his animal on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu'l-Hijja). and then went back quickly (to Mecca) and performed circumambulation of the House (known as tawaf ifada) after which all that was unlawful for him became lawful; and those who had brought the sacrificial animals along with them did as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done
1228 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha. The wife of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), concerning his Tamattu' of Hajj and 'Umra and performing of Tamattu' by people in his company.
1229.01 | Hafsa (Allah be pleased with her), the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), said:Messenger of Allah. what about people who have put off Ihram whereas you have not put it off after your 'Umra? He said: I have stuck my hair and have driven my sacrificial animal, and would not, therefore, put off Ihram until I have sacrificed the animal.
1229.02 | Hafsa (Allah be pleased with her) reported:I said: Messenger of Allah what is the matter with you that you have not put off Ihram? The rest of the hadith is the same.
1229.03 | Hafsa (Allah be pleased with her) reported:I said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ): What is the matter with people that they have put off Ihram, whereas you have not put it off after your Umra'? He said: I have driven my sacrificial animal and stuck my hair, and it is not permissible for me to put off Ihram unless I have completed the Hajj.
1229.04 | Hafsa (Allah be pleased with her) said:Messenger of Allah; the rest of the hadith is the same and (the concluding words of the Holy Prophet):" I won't put off Ihram until I have sacrificed the animal."
1229.05 | Hafsa (Allah be pleased with her) said that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) commanded his wives that they should put off Ihram during the year of Hajj (at-ul-Wada'). whereupon she (Hafsa) said:What hinders you that you have not put off Ihram? Thereupon he said: I have stuck my hair and driven my sacrificial animal along with men and it is not permissible to put off Ihram (under this condition until I have sacrificed the animal.
1230.01 | Nafi' reported that 'Abdullah b. Umar (Allah be pleased with them) set out for Umra during the turmoil, and he said:If I am detained (from going to) the House, we would do the same as we did with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). So he went out and put on Ihram for 'Umra and moved on until he reached al-Baida'. He turned towards his Companions and said: There is one command for both of them. and 1 call you as my witness (and say) that verify I have- made Hajj with 'Umra compulsory for me. He proceeded until, when he came to the House, he circumambulated it seven times and ran between al-Safa' and al-Marwa seven times, and made no addition to it and thought it to be sufficient for him and offered sacrifice.
1230.02 | Nafi' reported that 'Abdullah b. 'Abdullah and Salim b. Abdullah said to 'Abdullah (b. 'Umar) at the time when Hajjaj came to fight against Ibn Zubair:There would be no harm if you do not (proceed) for Hajj this year, for we fear that there would be fight among people which would cause obstruction between you and the House, whereupon he said: If there would be obstruction between me and that (Ka'ba), I would do as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did. I was with him (the Holy Prophet) when the infidels of Quraish caused obstructions between him (the Holy Prophet) and the House. I call you as my witness (to the fact) that I have made 'Umra essential for me. He proceeded until he came to Dhu'l-Hulaifa and pronounced Talbiya for Umra, and said: If the way Is clear forme, I would then complete my 'Umra but If there is some obstruction between me and that (the Ka'ba). I would then do what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done (at the occasion of Hudaibiya), and I was with him (the Holy Prophet). and then recited:" Verily in the Messenger of Allah, there is a model pattern for you" (xxxiii. 21). He then moved on until he came to the rear side of al-Baida' and said: There is one command for both of them automatically) (Hajj and Umra). If I am detained (in the performance) of 'Umra, I am ( automatically detained (in the performance) of Hajj (too). I call you as witness that Hajj along with 'Umra I had made essential for me. (I am performing Hajj and 'Umra as Qiran.) He then bought sacrificial animals at Qudaid and then circumambulated the House and ran between al-Safa' and al-Marwa once (covering both Hajj and Umra), and did not put off Ihram until on the Day of Sacrifice in the month of Dhu'l-Hijja.
1230.03 | Nafi' reported that Ibn Umar intended to go to Hajj (during the year) when Hajjaj attacked Ibn Zubair, and he narrated the account as (narrated above), and he used to say at the end of the hadith:He who combines Hajj with Umra, for him one single circumambulation is sufficient, and he did not put off Ihram until he had completed both of them.
1230.04 | Nafi' reported that Ibn Umar intended to go for Hajj during the year when Hajjaj attacked Ibn Zubair. It was said to him:There is a state of war between people and we fear that they would detain you, whereupon he ('Abdullah b. Umar) said:" Verily in the Messenger of Allah there is a model pattern for you." I would do as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did. I call you as witness that I have undertaken to perform 'Umra. He then set out until, when he reached the rear side of al-Baida', he said: There is one command both for Hajj and Umra. so bear witness. Ibn Rumh said: I call you as witness that I have undertaken to perform my Hajjalong with my Umra (i. e. I am performing both of them as Qiran), and he offered the sacrifice of animals which he had bought at Qudaid. He then proceeded pronouncing Talbiya for both of them together until he reached Mecca, He circumambulated the House. and (ran) between al-Safa' and al-Marwa and made no addition to it. He neither sacrificed the animal, nor got his head shaved, nor got his hair clipped, nor did he make anything lawful which was unlawful (due to Ihram) until it was the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu'l-Hijja). He then offered sacrifice, and got his hair cut, and saw that circumambulation of Hajj and 'Umra was complete with the first circumambulation. Ibn 'Umar said: This is how Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done.
1230.05 | This hadith has been narrated from Ibn Umar through another chain of transmitters except with (this variation) that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) was mentioned in the first part of the hadith,. i. e. when it was said to him:They would bar you (from going) to the House. He said: In that, case I would do what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done. He did not mention at the end of this hadith (i. e. these words):" This is how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had done," as it Is narrated by al-Laith.
1231 | Nafi' thus reported on the authority of Ibn Umar:We entered into the state of Ihram with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for Hajj Mufrad and in the narration of Ibn 'Aun (the words are):" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) entered into the state of Ihram (with the intention) of Hajj Mufrad."
1232.01 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) said:I heard Allah's Apostle (way peace be upon him) pronouncing Talbiya for both Hajj and Umra. Bakr (one of the narrators) said: I narrated it to Ibn 'Umar, whereupon he said: He (the Holy Prophet) pronounced the Talbiya for Hajj alone. I met Anas and narrated to him the words of Ibn 'Umar, whereupon he said: You treat us not but only as children. I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) pronouncing Talbiya both for 'Umra and Hajj.
1232.02 | Bakr b. 'Abdullah reported:Anas (Allah be pleased with him) had narrated to us that he saw Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) combining Hajj and 'Umra. He (Bakr) said: I asked (about it) from Ibn 'Umar, whereupon he said: We entered into the state of Ihram for Hajj (only). I came to Anas and told him what Ibn Umar had said, whereupon he remarked: (You are treating us) as if we were children.
1233.01 | Wabara reported:While I was sitting in the company of Ibn 'Umar, a person came to him and said: Is it right for me to circumambulate the House before I come to stay (at 'Arafat)? Ibn 'Umar said: Yes. whereupon he said: Ibn Abbas, however, says: Do not circumambulate the House until you come to stay at 'Arafat. Thereupon Ibn 'Umar said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Performed the Hajj and circumambulated the House before coming to stay (at 'Arafat). If you say the Truth, is it more rightful to follow the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ) or the words of Ibn Abbas?
1233.02 | Wabara reported:A person asked Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him): May I circumambulate the House, whereas I have entered-into the state of Ihram for Hajj? Thereupon he said: What prevents you from doing it? He said: I saw the son of so and so showing disapproval of it, and you are dearer to us as compared with him. And we see that he is allured by the world, whereupon he said: Who amongst you and us is not allured by the world? And said (further) ': 'We saw that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) put on Ihram for Hajj and circumambulated the House and run between al Safa' and al-Marwa. And the way prescribed by Allah and that prescribed by His Apostle (ﷺ) deserve more to be followed than the way shown by so and so, if you speak the truth.
1234.01 | Amr b. Dinar said:We asked Ibn Umar about a person who came for Umra and circumambulated the House, but he did not run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, whether he is allowed to (put off Ihram) and have intercourse with his wife. He replied: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) circumambulated the House seven times and offered two rak'ahs of prayer after staying (at 'Arafat), and ran between al-Safa and al-Marwa seven times." Verily there is in Allah's Messenger a model pattern for you" (xxxill. 21).
1234.02 | This hadith is narrated by another chain of transmitters.
1235 | Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Rahman reported:A person from Iraq said to him to inquire from 'Urwa b. Zubair for him whether a person who puts on Ihram for Hajj is allowed to put it off or not as he circumambulates the House. And if he says:" No, it can't be put off," then tell him that there is a person who makes such an assertion. He (Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Rahman) then said: I asked him ( Urwa b. Zubair), where- upon he said: The person who has entered into the state of Ihram for Hajj cannot get out of it unless he has, completed the Hajj I (further) said (to him): (What) if a person makes that assertion? Thereupon he said: It is indeed unfortunate that he makes such an assertion. That person ('Iraqi) then met me and he asked me and I narrated to him (the reply of 'Urwa), whereupon he (the Iraqi) said: Tell him ('Urwa) that a person had informed him that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done that; and why is it that Asma' and Zubair have done like this? He (Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Rahman) said: I went to him and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he ('Urwa) said: Who is he (the 'Iraqi)? I said: I do not know, whereupon he said: What is the matter that he does not come to me himself and ask me? I suppose he is an 'Iraqi. I said: I do not know, whereupon he said: He has told a lie. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) performed Hajj, and 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) has told me that the first thing with which he commenced (the rituals) when he arrived at Mecca was that he performed ablution and then circumambulated the Ka'ba. Then Abu Bakr performed Hajj and the first thing with which he commenced (the Hajj) as the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and nothing besides it. So did 'Umar. Then 'Uthman performed Hajj and I saw that the first thing with which he commenced the Hajj was the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and nothing besides it. Then Mu'awiya and Abdullah b. 'Umar did that. Then I performed Hajj with my father Zubair b. al-'Awwam, and the first thing with which he commenced (Hajj) was the circumambulation of the House. He then did nothing besides it. I then saw the emigrants (Muhajirin) and the helpers (Ansar) doing like this and nothing besides it. And the last one whom I saw doing like this was Ibn 'Umar. And he did not break it (the Hajj) after performing 'Umra. And Ibn 'Umar is with them. Why don't they ask him (to testify it)? And none amongst those who had passed away commenced (the rituals of Hajj) but by circumambulating the Ka'ba on their (first arrival) and they did not put off Ihram (without completing the Hajj), and I saw my mother and my aunt commencing (their Hajj) with the circumambulation of the House, and they did not put off Ihram. My mother informed me that she came and her sister, and Zubair and so and so for 'Umra, and when they had kissed the corner (the Black Stone, after Sa'i and circumambulation), they put off Ihram. And he (the 'Iraqi) has told a lie in this matter.
1236.01 | Asma bint Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported:We set out (to Mecca) in a state of Ihram. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He who has the sacrificial animal with him should remain in the state of Ihram, but he who has not the sacrificial animal with him should put off Ihram. As I had not the sacrificial animal with me, I put off Ihram. And since Zubair (her husband) - had the sacrificial animal with him, he did not put off Ihram. She (Asma) said: I put on my clothes and then went out and sat by Zabair, whereupon he said: Go away from me, whereupon I said: Do you fear that I would jump upon you?
1236.02 | Asma bint Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with th (m) said:We came for Hajj in the state of Ihram with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The rest of the hadith is the same except (for the words) that he (Zubair) said: Keep away from me, keep away from me, whereupon I said: Do you fear that I will jump upon you?
1237 | Abdullah, the freed slave of Asma' bint Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with them), narrated that he used to hear Asma, ' whenever she passed by Hajun, saying (these words):" May there be peace and blessing of Allah upon His Messenger." We used to stay here along with him with light burdens. Few were our rides, and small were our provisions. I performed 'Umra and so did my sister 'A'isha, and Zubair and so and so. And as we touched the House (performed circumambulation and Sa'i) we put off Ihram, and then again put on Ihram in the afternoon for Hajj. Harun (one of the narrators) in one of the narrations said: The freed slave of Asma' and he did not mention 'Abdullah.
1238.01 | Muslim al-Qurri reported:I asked Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) about Tamattu' in Hajj and he permitted it, whereas Ibn Zubair had forbidden it. He (Ibn 'Abbas) said: This is the mother of Ibn Zubair who states that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had permitted it, so you better go to her and ask her about it. He (Muslim al-Qurri said): So we went to her and she was a bulky blind lady and she said: Verily Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) permitted it.
1238.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of words.
1239.01 | Muslim al-Qurri heardlbn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) saying that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) entered into the state of Ihram for Umra and his Companions for Hajj. Neither Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) nor those among his Companions who had brought sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram, whereas the rest (of the pilgrims) did so. Talha b. Ubaidullah was one of those who had brought the sacrificial animals along with them so he did not put off Ihram.
1239.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters but with this variation (of words):" Talha and another person also were among those who had not brought the sacrificial animals with them and so they put off Ihram."
1240.01 | Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that they (the Arabs of pre-Islamic days) looked upon Umra during the months of Hajj as the greatest of sins on the earth. So they intercalated the month of Muharram for Safar and said:When the backs of their camels would become all right and traces (if the pilgrims) would be effaced (from the paths) and the month of Safar would be over, then Umra would be permissible for one who wants to perform it. When Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and his Companions came in the state of Ihram for performing Hajj on the fourth (of Dhu'l-Hijja) he (Allah's Apostle) commanded them to change their state of Ihram (from Hajj) to that of 'Umra. It was something inconceivable for them. So they said: Messenger of Allah, is it a complete freedom (of the obligation) of Ihram? Thereupon he said: It is a complete freedom (from Ihram).
1240.02 | Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) 'is reported to have said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) put on Ihigm for Hajj. When four days of Dhu'l-Hijja were over, he led the dawn prayer, and when the prayer was complete, he said: He who wants to change it to Umra may do so.
1240.03 | Rauh and Yahya b. Kathir narrated as Nasr reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered into the state of Ihram for Hajj. And in the narration of Abu Shihab (the words are):We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pronouncing Talbiya for Hajj, And in an the ahadith (narrated in this connection the words are): He led the morning prayer at al-Batha', except al- jahdami who did not make mention of it.
1240.04 | Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came along with his Companions when four days had passed out of ten days (of Dhu'l-Hijja) and they were pronouncing Talbiya for Hajj, and he (the Holy Prophet) commanded them to change (this Ihram) into that of 'Umra.
1240.05 | Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) observed the morning prayer at Dhu Tawa (a valley near Mecca) and arrived (in Mecca) when four days of Dhul-Hijja had passed and he commanded his Companions that they should change their Ihram (of Hajj) to that of Umra, except those who had brought sacrificial animals with them.
1241 | Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:This is the 'Umra of which we have taken advantage. So he who has not the sacrificial animal with him should get out of the state of Ihram completely, for 'Umra has been incorporated in Hajj until the Day of Resurrection,
1242 | Abu Jam at al-Dubu'i reported:I performed Tamattu' but the people dis- couraged me to do so. I came to Ibn 'Abbas and asked him about it. He ordered me to do so. I came to the House (Ka'ba) and slept. I saw a visitant in the dream who said: 'Umra is acceptable and so is the Hajj performed for God's sake. I came to Ibn Abbas and informed him about that Which I saw in the dream whereupon he said: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest This is the Sunnah of Abu'l-Qasim (the Holy Pro- phet) (ﷺ).
1243.01 | Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) observed the Zuhr prayer at Dhu'l-Hulaifa; then called for his she-camel and marked it on the right side of its bump, removed the blood from it, and tied two sandals round its neck. He then mounted his camel, and when it brought him up to al-Baida', he pronounced Talbiya for the Pilgrimage.
1243.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Qatada with the same chain of transmitters but with this variation (of words):" When Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came to Dhu'l-Hulaifa" and he made no mention (of the fact) that he led the Zuhr prayer.
1244.01 | Abu Hassan al-A'raj reported that a person from Bani Hujaim said to Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them):What is this religious verdict of yours which has engaged the attention of the people or which has become a matter of dispute among them that he who circumambulated the House can be free from Ihram? Thereupon he said: That is the Sunnah of your Apostle (ﷺ), even though you may not approve of it.
1244.02 | Abu Hassan reported:It was said to Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) that this affair had engaged the attention of the people that he who circumambu- lates the House was permitted to circumambulate for Umra (even though he was in a state of Ihram for Hajj), whereupon he said: That is the Sunnah of your Apostle (ﷺ), even though you may not approve of it.
1245 | Ata' said:Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) used to say that a pilgrim or non-pilgrim (one performing 'Umar) who circumambulates the House is free from the responsibility of Ihram. I (Ibn Juraij, one of the narrators) said to 'Ata': On what authority does he (Ibn Abbas) say this? He said: On the authority uf Allah's words:" Then their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House" (al-Qur'an, xxii. 33). I said: It concerns the time after staying at 'Arafat, whereupon he said: Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) had stated (that the place of sacrifice is the Ancient House) ; it way be after staying at 'Arafat or before (staying there). And he (Ibn Abbas) made this deduction I from the command of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) when he had ordered to put off Ihram on the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage.
1246.01 | Ibn Abbas reported that Mu'awiya had said to them:Do you know that I clipped some hair from the head of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at al- Marwa with the help of a clipper? I said: I do not know it except as it verdict against you.
1246.02 | Ibn Abbis (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Mu'awiya b. Abu Safyin had told him:I clipped the hair (from the head of) Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) with a clipper while he was at al-Marwa, or I saw him getting his hair clipped with a clipper as he was at al-Marwa.
17221247 | Abu Sa'id (Allah be pleased with him) reported:We went out with Allah's messenger (ﷺ) pronouncing loudly the Talbiya for Hajj When we came to Mecca, he commanded us that we should change this (Ihram for Hajj) to that of Umra except one who had brought the sacrificial animal with him. When it was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhul-Hijja) and we went to Mini, we (again) pronounced Talbiya for Hajj.
1248 | jibir and Abil Salld al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with them) reported:We went with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and we were pronouncing Talbiya for Hajj loudly.
1249 | Abd Nadra reported:While I was in the company of Jibir, a person came and said: There is difference of opinion amomg Ibn Abbas and Ibn Zubair about two Mut'as (benefits, Tamattul in Hajj and temporary marriage with women), whereupon jibir said: We have been doing this during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him), and then 'Umar forbade us to do so, and we never resorted to them.
1250.01 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) came from the Yemen, and the Apostle (ﷺ) said:With (what intention) have you put on Ihram? He said: I have put on Ibram in accordance with the intention with which Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) has put on Ibram, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Had there not been the sacrificial animals with me, I would have put off Ihram (after performing 'Umra).
1250.02 | This hadith is narrated by Salim b. Hayyin with the same chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of words.
1251.01 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) pronouncing Talbiya for both simultaneously, Talbiya for 'Umra and Hajj. Talbiya for Uwra and Hajj (he performed both Hajj and Umra as a Qarin). In another version words are: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) pronouncing Talbiya for Umra and Hajj (simultaneously)."
1252.01 | Hanzala al-Aslami reported:I heard Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) as narrating from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) who said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life. Ibn Maryam (Jesus Christ) would certainly pronounce Talbiya for Hajj or for Umra or for both (simultaneously as a Qiran) In the valley of Rauha
1252.02 | Hanzala b. 'Ali al-Aslaml reported that he had heard Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) as saying that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had said:By Him In Whose Hand is my life; the rest of the hadith is the same.

1253.01 | Qatada said:I asked Anas (Allah be pleased with him) as to how many Pilgrimages had been performed by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and he replied: One Hajj and four `Umras were performed by him. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1253.02 | Abu lshaq said:I asked Zaid b. Arqam: In how many military expeditions have you participated with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? He said: In seventeen (expeditions). He (Abu Ishaq) said: Zaid b. Arqam reported to me that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had led nineteen expeditions. And he performed Hajj only once after Migration, and that was the Farewell Pilgrimage. Abu Ishaq also said: The second (Hajj) he performed at Mecca (before his Migration to Medina)
1254 | 'Ataa reported that 'Urwa b. Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) had informed him (this):I and Ibn 'Umar were reclining against the (wall) of the apartment of A'isha and we were listening to the sound produced by the brushing of her teeth. I said Abu Abd al-Rahman (the kunya of 'Abdullah b. Umar), did Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) perform 'Umra in the month of Rijab? He said: Yes. I said to 'A'isha: Mother, are you listening to what Abu Abd al-Rabman is saying? She said: What is he Saying? I said: He is saying that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) performed 'Umra during the month of Rajab, whereupon she said: May Allah grant pardon to Abu Abd al-Rahman I By my life he (the Holy Prophet) did not perform 'Umra during the month of Rajab. And never was there an Umra performed by him (the Holy Prophet) in which he ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) did not join him. Ibn 'Umar heard this and said nothing to affirm It or to deny it, but kept quiet.
1255.01 | Mujahid reported:I and 'Urwah b. Zubair entered the mosque and found 'Abdullah b. 'Umar sitting near the apartment of A'ishah and the people were observing the forenoon prayer (when the sun had sufficiently risen). We asked him about their prayer, and he said: It is bid'a (innovation), Urwah said to him: O Abu Abd al-Rahman, how many 'umrahs did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) perform?

1277.01 | Hisham b. 'Urwa reported on the authority of his father who narrated from 'A'isha. He said to 'A'isha:I think if a person does not run between al- Safa' and al-Marwa, It does not do any harm to him (so far as Hajj is concerned). She said: Why (do you think so)? I said: For Allah says:" Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah" (ii. 158) (to the end of the verse), whereupon she said: Allah does not complete the Hajj of a person or his Umra if he does not observe Sa'i between al-Safa' and al-marwa; and if it were so as you state, then (the wording would have been (fala janah an la yatufu biha) [" There is no harm for him if he does not circumambulate between them']. Do you know in what context (this verse was revealed)? (It was revealed in this context) that the Ansar in the Days of Ignorance pronounced the Talbiya for two idols. (fixedl on the bank of the river which were called Isaf and Na'ila. The people went there, and then circumambulated between al-Safa' and al-Marwa and then got their heads shaved. With the advent of Islam they (the Muslims) did not like to circumambulate between them as they used to do during the Days of Ignorance. It was on account of this that Allah. the Exalted and Majestic, revealed:" Verily al-Safe and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah" to the end of the verse. She said: Then people began to observe Sa'i.
1277.02 | Hisham b. 'Urwa narrated on the authority of his father who reported:I said to 'A'isha: I do not see any harm to me if I do not circumambulate betweez al-Safa' and al-Marwa. She said: On what ground do you say so? (I said: ) Since Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, says:" Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah." It (your assertion) were (correct), it would have been said like this:" There is no harm for him, that he should not circumambulate between them." It (this verse) has been revealed about the people of Ansar. Whenever they pronounced the Talbiya, they pronounced it in the name of al-Manat during the Days of Ignorance; so they (thought) that it was not permissible for them (for the Muslims) to circumambulate between and al-Marwa. When they (the Muslims) came with Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) for Hajj, they mentioned it to him. So Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse. By my life, Allah will not complete the Hajj of one who has not circumambulated between al-Safa and al-Marwa.
1277.03 | 'Urwa b. Zabair reported:I said to 'A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ): I do not see any (fault) in one who does not circumambl" te between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, and I do not mind if I do not circumambulate between them, whereupon she said: O, the son of my sister, what you say is wrong. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) observed Sa'i and so did the Muslims. So it is a Sunnah (of the Prophet). And it was a common practice (with the pagan Arabs) that those who pronounced Talbiya for the wretched al-Manat, situated at Mushalla, did not observe Sa'i between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. With the advent of Islam, we asked Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) about this practice, and (it was on this occasion) that Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse:" Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah" ; so he who performed Hajj or 'Umra it is no sin on him if he circumambulates them. And if it were as you state, (then the wording would have been):" There is no harm for him, that he should not circumambulate round them." Zuhri said: I made a mention of that to Abu Bakr b. 'Abd al- Rahman b. al-Harith b. Hisham; he was impressed by that and said: This is what is called knowledge. And I have heard many a scholar saying: Many of the Arabs who did not circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa caid: Our circumambulation between these two hills is an act of ignorance; whereas others among the Ansar said: We have been commanded to circumambulate the House, and not Commanded to run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. So Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed thia verse:" Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah." Abu Bakr b. 'Abd al-Rahman said: I think that this (verse) has been revealed for such and such (persons).
1277.04 | 'Urwa b. Zubair reported:I asked 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) ; the rest of the hadith is the same. And in this hadith (these words are also found):" When they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about this, they said: Messenger of Allah, we felt reluctant to circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. Then Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse:" Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of. Allah so he who perform Hajj or Umra it is no sin on him if he should circumambulate between them. 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) laid down this Sa'i between them as Sunnah (of the Holy Prophet). So it is not advisable for anyone to abandon this Sa'i between them.
1277.05 | 'Urwa b. Zabair narrated on the authority of 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) who informed him that the Ansar and the people of the tribe of Ghassan before embracing Islam pronounced Talbiya for Manat, and so they avoided circumambulating between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, and it was a common practice with their forefather, that he who put on Ihram for Manat did not circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. And when they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it, and then Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse:" Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah" ; so he who performs Hajj or Umra, for him there is no harm if he should circumambulate between them, and he who does good spontaneously-surely Allah is Bountiful in rewarding and Knowing.
1278 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Ansar felt reluctant that they should circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa until it was revealed:" Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah" ; so whoever performs Hajj or 'Umra, for him there is no harm that he should circumambulate between them.
1279.01 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and his Companions did not observe Sa'i between al-Safa' and al-Marwa but only one Sa'i.

I poured water and he, performed light ablution. I then said: Messenger of Allah, it is time for prayer. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The prayer awaits you (at the next station, Muzdalifa). Allah's Messenger (may peaced be upon him) rode on until he came to Muzdalifa and observed prayer. Then al-Fadl (Allah be pleased with him) sat behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and reached (Muzdalifa) in the morning. Kuraib said: 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) narrated from al-Fadl (Allah be pleased with him) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued pronouncing Talbiya until he reached al-Jamara (al-'Aqaba).
1281.02 | Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) made al-Fadl sit behind him (on the camel back) from the place (where the two prayers) are combined (Muzdalifa). Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) also informed that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) did not stop pronouncing Talbiya till he threw pebbles at Jamrat al-'Aqaba.
1282.01 | Ibn 'Abbas narrated from al-Fadl b. Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) who sat behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that he (the Holy Prophet) said to the people on the evening of 'Arafa and on the morning to the gathering of people (at Muzdalifa) as they were pushing on to proceed slowly. And he himself drove his she-camel with restraint until he entered Muhassir (it is a place in Mina), and further told them to take up pebbles which were to be thrown at Jamra. And Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued pronouncing Talbiya till he stoned the Jamra.
1282.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abd Zubair with the same chain of transmitters but with this variation that in the hadith no mention is made of (this) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued pronouncing Talbiya till he stoned the Jamra, and he made this addition in his hadith:" The Apostle (ﷺ) pointed with his hand how a person should catch hold of pebbles (in order to throw them)."

It was said:He might be a Bedouin (not knowing correctly the rituals of Hajj and, therefore, pronouncing Talbia at this stage), whereupon Abdullah said: Hive the people forgotten (this Sunnah of the Holy Prophet) or have they gone astray? I heard him, upon whom Sibrah al-Baqara was revealed, pronouncing Talbiya at the very place.
1283.04 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Yazid and al-Aswad b. Yazid reported:We heard 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud saying to the gathering of people (at Muzdalifa) that he had heard Talbiya from him, upon whom Surah al-Baqara was revealed, at this very place. And so he ('Abdullah b. Mas'ud) pronounced Talbiya and we also pronounced it with him.
1284.01 | 'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with them). He said:As we proceeded in the morning along with AUbs Messenger (ﷺ) from Mina to 'Arafat, some of us prounced Talbiya, and some pronounced Takbir (Allah-o-Akbar).
1284.02 | Abdullah b. 'Umar reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with them):We were along with Allah's Messenger (way peace he upon him) in the morning of 'Arafa (9th of Dhu'l-Hijja). Some of us pronounced Takbir and some of us Tahlil La ilaha ill-Allah). And to those of us who pronounced Takbir, I said: By Allah, how strange it is that you did not care to ask him: What did you see Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) doing (on this occasion)?
1285.01 | Muhammad b. Abu Bakr al-Thaqafi asked Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him), while on their way from Mina to 'Arafa in the morning:What did you do on this day in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?

Then he offered the sunset prayer. and the people halted their camels at their places, and did not untie them until Iqama was pronounced for the 'Isha' prayer and he observed the prayer, and then they untied (their camels). I said: What did you do in the morning? He said: Al-Fadl b.

1333.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Hisham with the same chain of transmitters.
1333.03 | 'A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as having said this:Didn't you see that when your people built the Ka'ba, they reduced (its area with the result that it no longer remains) on the foundations (laid) by Ibrahim. I said: Messenger of Allah, why don't you rebuild it on the foundations (laid by) Ibrahim? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Had your people not been new converts to Islam, I would have done that. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) said: If 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) had heard it from Allah's Messenger (may peace be up (vn him), I would not have seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) abandoning the touching of the two corners situated near al-Hijr, but (for the fact) that it was not completed on the foundations (laid) by Ibrihim.
1333.04 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her), wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If your people, had not been recent converts to Islam, I would have spent the treasure of the Ka'ba in the way of Allah and would have constructed its door just on the level of the ground and would have encompassed in it the space of Hijr.
1333.05 | 'Abdullah b. Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) reported on the authority of his mother's sister ('A'isha) saying that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:'A'isha, if your people had not been recently polytheists (and new converts to Islam), I would have demolished the Ka'ba, and would have brought it to the level of the ground and would have constructed two doors, one facing the east and the other one to the west, and would have added to it six cubits of area from Hijr, for the Quraish had reduced it when they rebuilt it.
1333.06 | 'Ata' reported:The House was burnt during the time of Yazid b. Muawiya when the people of Syria had fought (in Mecca). And it happened with it (the Ka'ba) what was (in store for it). Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) felt it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of Hajj). (The idea behind was) that he wanted to exhort them or incite them (to war) against the people of Syria. When the people had arrived he said to them: O people, advise me about the Ka'ba. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it? Ibn 'Abbas said: An idea has occurred to me according to which I think that you should only repair (the portion which has been) damaged, and leave the House (in that very state in which) people embraced Islam (and leave those very stones in the same state) when people embraced Islam, and over which Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had raised it. Thereupon Ibn Zubair said: It the house of any one of you is burnt, he would not be contented until he had reconstructed it, then what about the House of your Lord (which is far more Important than your house)? I would seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I would make up (my mind) about this affair. After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people apprehended that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb (over the building for the purpose of demolishing it), till one (took up courage, and ascended the roof), and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him, demolished it until it was razed to the ground. Then Ibn Zubair erected pillars and hung cartains on them (in order to provide facilities to the people for observing the time of its construction). And the walls were raised; and Ibn Zubair said: I heard 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) say that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had observed: If the people had Rot recently (abandoned) unbelief, find I had means enough to reconstruct it, which I had not, I would have definitely excompassed in it five cubits of area from Hijr. And I would also have constructed a door for the people to enter, and a door for their exit. I today have (the means to spend) and I entertain no fearfrom the side of people (that they would protest against this change). So he added five cubits of area from the side of Hatim to it that there appeared (the old) foundation (upon which Hadrat Ibrahim had built the Ka'ba). and the people saw that and it was upon this foundation that the wall was raised. The length of the Ka'ba was eighteen cubits. when addition was made to it (which was in its breadth), then naturally the length appears to be) small (as compared with its breadth). Then addition of ten cubits (of area) was made in its length (also). Two doors were also constructed, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit. When Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) was killed, Hajjaj wrote to 'Abd al-Malik (b. Marwan) informing him about it, and telling him that Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) had built (the Ka'ba) on those very foundations (which were laid by Ibrahim) and which reliable persons among the Meccans had seen. 'Abd al-Malik wrote to him: We are not concerned with the censuring of Ibn Zubair in anything. Keep intact the addition made by him in the side of length, and whatever he has added frem the side of Hijr revert to (its previous) foundation, and wall up the door which he had opened. Thus Hajjaj at the command of Abd al-Malik) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on (its previous) foundations.
1333.07 | Abdullah b. 'Ubaid reported that Harith b. 'Abdullah led a deputation to 'Abd al-Malik b. Marwan during his caliphate. 'Abd al-Malik said:I do riot think that Abu Khubaib (i. e. Ibn Zabair) had heard from 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) (about the intended wish of the Prophet [may peace be upon him) In regard to the alteration of the Ka'ba). Harith said: Yes, I myself did hear from her. He ('Abd al-Malik) said: Well, tell me what you heard from her. He stated that she (Hadrat 'A'isha) had said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) remarked: Verily your people have reduced (the area) of the House from its (original foundations, and if they had not recently abandoned polytheism (and embraced Islam) I would have reversed it to (those foundations) which they had left out of it. nd if your people would take initiative after me in rebuilding it, then come along with me so that I should show you what they have left out of it. He showed her about fifteen cubits of area from the side of Hatim (that they had separated). This is the narration transmitted by 'Abdullah b. Ubaid. Walid b. 'Ata' has, however, made this addition to it:" Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: I would have made two doors on the level of the ground (facing) the east and the west. Do you know why your people raised the level of its door (i. e. the door of the Ka'ba)? She said: No. He said: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to him only whom they wished. When a person intended to get into it, they let him climb (the stairs), and as he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down." 'Abd al-Malik said to Harith; Did you yourself hear her saying this? He said: Yes. He (Harith) said that he ('Abd al-Malik) scratched the ground with his staff for some time and then said: I wish I had left his (Ibn Zubair's) work there.

1333.09 | Abu Qaza'ah reported that while Abd al-Malik b. Marwan was circumambulating the Ka'ba he said:May Allah ruin Ibn Zubair that he lies in attributing to the Mother of the Faithful, as he says: I heard her stating that Allah's Messenger (may'peace be upon him) had said: 'A'isha, if your people had not been new converts to Islam, I would have demolished the House and would have added (in it area) from the Hijr for your people have reduced the area from its foundations. Harith b. 'Abdullah b. Abu Rabi'a (Allah be pleased with him) said: Commander of the Faithful, don't say that, for I heard the Mother of the Faithful saying this, whereupon he said: If I had heard this before demolishing it, I would have left it in the state in which Ibn Zabair had built it.
1333.10 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about the wall, circumpassing the House (i. e. whether the wall on the side of Hijr was included in the Ka'ba). He said, Yes. I said: Then why did they not include it in the House? He said: 'Your people ran short of the means (to do so). I said: Why is it that the level of its door is raised high? He said: Your people did it so that they should admit one whom they liked, and forbid him whom they disliked, and if your people were not new converts to faith, and I did not apprehend that their hearts would feel agitated at this. I would have definitely included (the area of) this wall-in the House and would have brought the door to the level of the ground.
1333.11 | 'A'isha reported:I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about Hijr, and the rest of the hadith is the same. I also said: Why is it that the door has been made on a higher level, and one cannot (get into it) but with the help of a ladder? The rest of the hadith is the same as reported above and the concluding words are: (I do not change it) out of the apprehension that their hearts may disapprove of it."
1334 | 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas reported that while al-Fadl b. Abbas had been riding behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) a women of the tribe of Khath'am came to him (to the Holy Proppet) asking for a religious verdict. Fadl looked at her and she looked at him. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) turned the face of al-Fadl to the other side. She said:Messenger of Allah, there is an obligation from Allah upon His servants in regard to Hajj. (But) my father is an aged man; he is incapable of riding safely. May I perform Hajj on his behalf? He said: Yes. It was during the Farewell Pilgrimage.
1335 | Fadl reported that a woman of Banu Khath'am said:Messenger of Allah, my father is very old. There is an old obligation of Hajj upon him from Allah, but he is not capable of sitting on the back of the camel. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Perform Hajj on his behalf.

Then he said: Leave me with what I have left to you, for those who were before you were desroyed because of excessive questioning, and their opposition to their apostles.

Its thorns are not to be cut, its game is not to be molested, and the things dropped are to be picked up only by one who makes a public announcement of it, and its fresh herbage is not to be cut. Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) said: Messenger of Allah, exception may be made in case of rush, for it is useful for their blacksmiths and for their houses. He (the Holy Prophet) conceding the suggestion of 'Abbas) said: Except rush.
1353.02 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Mansur, but he did not mention:" On that very day He created the heavens and the earth," and he (the narrator) substituted the word" fighting" (qital) for" killing" (qatl), and further said:" No one is to pick up the dropped thing except one who makes a public announcement of it."

O Commander, which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said on the day following, the Conquest which my ears heard and my heart has retained, and my eyes saw as he spoke it. He praised Allah and extolled Him and then said: Allah, not men, has made Mecca sacred; so it is not permissible for any person believing in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood in it, or lop a tree in it. If anyone seeks a concession on the basis of fighting of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), tell him that Allah permitted His Messenger, but not you, and He gave him permission only for an hour on one day, and its sacredness was restored on the very day like that of yesterday. Let him who is present convey the information to him who is absent. It was said to Abu Shuraih: What did Amr say to you? He said: I am better informed of that than you, Abu Shuraih, but the sacred territory does not grant protection to one who is disobedient, or one who runs away after shedding blood, or one who runs away after committing
1355.01 | Abu Huraira, (Allah be pleased with him) reported. When Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, granted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) victory over Mecca, he stood before people and praised and extolled Allah and then said:Verily Allah held back the elephants from Mecca and gave the domination of it to His Messenger and believers, and it (this territory) was not violable to anyone before me and it was made violable to me for an hour of a day, and it shall not be violable to anyone after me. So neither molest the game, nor weed out thorns from it. And it is not lawful for anyone to pick up a thing dropped but one who makes public announcement of it. And it a relative of anyone is killed he is entitled to opt for one of two things. Either he should be paid blood-money or he can take life as (a just retribution). 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah's Messenger, but Idhkhir (a kind of herbage), for we use it for our graves and for our houses, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: With the exception of Idhkhir. A person known as Abu Shah, one of the people of Yemen, stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, (kindly) write it for me. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said I Write it for Abu Shah. Walid said: I asked al-Auzai': What did his saying mean:" Write it for me, Messenger of Allah"? He said: This very address that he had heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).

It was reported to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He mounted his camel and delivered this address: Verily Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, held back the Ele- phants from Mecca, and gave its domination to His Messenger and believers. Behold, it was not violable for anyone before me and it will not be violable for anyone after me. Behold, it was made violable for me for an hour of a day; and at this very hour it has again been made inviolable (for me as well as for others). So its thorns are not to be cut, its trees are not to be lopped, and (no one is allowed to) pick up a thing dropped, but the one who makes an announcement of it. And one whose fellow is killed is allowed to opt between two alternatives: either he should receive blood-money or get the life of the (murderer) in return. He (the narrator said): A person from the Yemen, who was called Abu Shah, came to him and said: Messenger of Allah, write it down for me, whereupon he (Allah's Messenger) said: Write it down for Abu Shah. One of the persons from among the Quraish also said: Except Idhkhir, for we use it in our houses ant our graves. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Except Idhkhir.

1360.01 | 'Abdullah b. Zaid b. 'Asim (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Verily Ibrahim declared Mecca sacred and supplicated (for blessings to be showered) upon its inhabitants, and I declare Medina to be sacred as lbrahim had declared Mecca to be sacred.

Khadij called to him and said:What is this that I hear you making mention of Mecca and its inhabitants and its sacredness, but you did not make mention of Medina and its inhabitants and its sacredness, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has also declared sacred (the area) between its two lava lands (Medina)? And (we have record of this) with us written on Khaulani parchment. If you like, I can read it out to you. Thereupon Marwan became silent, and then Said: I too have heard some part of it.

1363.02 | 'Amir b. Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with him) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, and then the (above-mentioned) hadith was narrated with this addition:" None should nurse ill-will towards the people of Medina, or Allah will melt him in fire like the melting of lead or the dissolution of salt in water.
1364 | 'Amir b. Sa'd reported that Sa'd rode to his castle in al-'Aqiq and found a slave cutting down the trees, or beating off their leaves, so he stripped him off his belongings. When Sa'd returned, there came to him the masters of the slave and negotiated with him asking him to return to their slave or to them what he had taken from their slave, whereupon he said:God forbid that I should return anything which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has given me as spoil, and refused to return anything to them.
1365.01 | Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Abu Talha (Allah be pleased with him):Find for me a servant from amongst your boys to serve me. Abu Talha went out along with me and made me sit behind him. And I used to serve Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whenever he got down from the camel. And in one hadith he said: He proceeded and when (the mountain of) Uhud was within sight, he said: This is the mountain which loves us and we love it. And as he came close to Medina he said: O Allah, I declare (the area) between the two mountains of it (Medina) sacred just as Ibrahim declared Mecca as sacred. O Allah, bless them (the people of Medina) in their mudd and sa'.
1365.02 | Anas b. Malik reported a hadith like this from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) except with this variation that he said:" I declare sacred the area between its two lava mountains."
1366 | 'Asim reported:I asked Anas b. Malik whether Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had declared Medina as sacred. He said: Yes. (the area) between so and so.

Ibn Anas said: Or he accommodates an innovator.

Abi Talib (Allah be pleased with him) addressed us and said: He who thought that we have besides the Holy Qur'an anything else that we recite, he told a lie. And this document which is hanging by the sheath of the sword contains but the ages of the camels, and the nature of the wounds. He (Hadrat 'Ali) reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying: Medina is sacred from 'Air to Thaur; So if anyone makes an innovation or accommodates an innovator, the curse of Allah, the angels, and all persons will fall upon him, and Allah will not accept any obligatory or supererogatory act as recompense from them. And the protection granted by the Muslims is one and must be respected by the humblest of them. If anyone makes a false claim to paternity, or being a client of other than his own masters, there is upon him the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people. Allah will not accept from him any recompense in the form of obligatory acts or supererogatory acts. The hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Bakr and Zabair ends with (these words): The humblest among them should respect it; and what follows after it is not mentioned there, and in the hadith transmitted by them (these words are) not found: (The document was hanging) on the sheath of his sword.

And in the hadith transmitted by Waki' there is no mention of the Day of Resurrection.

1371.01 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:Medina is a sacred territory, so he who made any innovation in it. or gave protection to an innovator, there is upon him the curse of Allah, that of the angels and that of all the people. There would not be accepted on the Day of Resurrection either obligatory acts or supererogatory acts from him.
1371.02 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of A'mash with the same chain of transmitters, but no mention has been made of the Day of Resurrection. But this addition is made:" The protection granted by Muslims is one and must be respected by the humblest of them.

1373.01 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the people saw the first fruit (of the season or of plantation) they brought it to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). When he received it he said:O Allah, bless us in our fruits; and bless us in our city; and bless us in our sa's and bless us in our mudd. O Allah, Ibrahim was Thy servant, Thy friend, and Thy apostle; and I am Thy servant and Thy apostle.

Thus no blood is to be shed within its (bounds) and no weapon is to be carried for fighting, and the leaves of the trees there should not be beaten off except for fodder. O Allah, bless us in our city; O Allah, bless us in our sil; O Allah, bless us in our mudd; O Allah, bless us in our sa; O Allah, bless us in our mudd. O Allah, bless us in our city. O Allah, bless with this blessing two more blessings. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, there is no ravine or mountain path of Medina which is not protected by two angels until you reach there.

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Khaibar is ruined. Verily when we get down in the valley of a people, evil is the morning of the warned ones (al-Qur'an, xxxvii. 177). Allah, the Majestic and the Glorious, defeated them (the inhabitants of Khaibar), and there fell to the lot of Dihya a beautiful girl, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got her in exchange of seven heads, and then entrusted her to Umm Sulaim so that she might embellish her and prepare her (for marriage) with him. He (the narrator) said: He had been under the impression that he had said that so that she might spend her period of 'Iddah in her (Umm Sulaim's) house. (The woman) was Safiyya daughter of Huyayy. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arranged the wedding feast consisting of dates, cheese, and refined butter, and pits were dug and tiers were set in them dining cloths, and there was brought cheese and refined butter, and these were placed there. And the people ate to their fill, and they said: We do not know whether he (the Holy Prophet) had married her (as a free woman), or as a slave woman. They said: If he (the Holy Prophet) would make her wear the veil, then she would be a (free married) woman, and if he would not make her wear the veil, then she should be a slave woman. When he intended to ride, he made her wear the veil and she sat on the hind part of the camel; so they came to know that he had married her. As they approached Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) drove (his ride) quickly and so we did. 'Adba' (the name of Allah's Apostle's camel) stumbled and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fell down and she (Radrat Safiyya: also fell down. He (the Holy Prophet) stood up and covered her.

Two persons were left and they were busy in talking and did not get out (of the apartment). He (the Holy Prophet) then proceeded towards (the apartments of) his wives. He greeted with as-Salamu 'alaikum to every one of them and said: Members of the household, how are you? They said: Messenger of Allah, we are in good state 'How do you find your family? He would say: In good state. When he was free from (this work of exchanging greetings) he came back, and I also came back along with him. And as he reached the door, (he found) that the two men were still busy in talking. And when they saw him having returned, they stood up and went out; and by Allah! I do not know whether I had informed him, or there was a revelation to him (to the affect) that they had gone. He (the Holy Prophet) then came back and I also returned along with him, and as he put his step on the threshold of his door he hung a curtain between me and him, and (it was on this occasion) that Allah revealed this verse: (" O you who believe), do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to 'you" (xxxiii. 53).
1365.06 | Anas, (Allah be pleased with him) reported:Safiyya (Allah be pleased with her) fell to the lot of Dihya in the spoils of war, and they praised her in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: We have not seen the like of her among the captives of war. He sent (a messenger) to Dihya and he gave him whatever he demanded. He then sent her to my mother and asked her to embellish her. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then got out of Khaibar until when he was on the other side of it, he halted, and a tent was pitched for him. When it was morning Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He who has surplus of provision with him should bring that to us. Some persons would bring the surplus of dates, and the other surplus of mush of barley until there became a heap of bals. They began to eat the hais and began to drink out of the pond which had the water of rainfall in it and which was situated by their side. Anas said that that constituted the wedding feast of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He (further) said: We proceeded until we saw the walls of Medina, and we were delighted. We made our mounts run quickly and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also made his mount run quickly. And Safiyya (Allah be pleased with her) was at his back, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had seated her behind him. The camel of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stumbled and he (the Holy Prophet) fell down and she also fell down. And none among the people was seeing him and her, until Allah's Messeuger (ﷺ) stood up and he covered her, and we came to him and he said: We have received no injury. We entered Medina and there came out the young ladies of the household. They saw her (hadrat Safiyya) and blamed her for falling down.
1428.02 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported:When the 'Iddah of Zainab was over, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Zaid to make a mention to her about him. Zaid went on until he came to her and she was fermenting her flour. He (Zaid) said: As I saw her I felt in my heart an idea of her greatness so much so that I could not see towards her (simply for the fact) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had made a mention of her. So I turned my back towards her. and I turned upon my heels, and said: Zainab, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has sent (me) with a message to you. She said: I do not do anything until I solicit the will of my Lord. So she stood at her place of worship and the (verse of) the Qur'an (pertaining to her marriage) were revealed, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to her without permission. He (the narrator) said: I saw that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) served us bread and meat until it was broad day light and the people went away, but some persons who were busy in con- versation stayed on in the house after the meal. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also went out and I also followed him, and he began to visit the apartments of his wives greeting them (with the words): As-Salamu 'alaikum, and they would say: Allah's Messenger, how did you find your family (hadrat Zainab)? He (the narrator) stated: I do not know whether I had informed him that the people had gone out or he (the Holy Prophet) informed me (about that). He moved on until he entered the apartment, and I also went and wanted to enter (the apartment) along with him, but he threw a curtain between me and him, as (the verfes pertaining to seclusion) had been revealed, and people were instructed in what they had been instructed. Ibn Rafii had made this addition in his narration:" O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished..." to the words"... Allah forbears not from the truth."
1428.03 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported:I did not see Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) giving a wedding feast (on the marriage) of any one (of his wives) as he did in the case of (his marriage with) Zainab, for then he sacrificed a goat (on this occasion).
1428.04 | Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave no better wedding feast than the one he did (on the occasion of his marriage with) Zainab. Thabit al-Bunani (one of the narrators) said: What did he serve in the wedding feast? He (Anas) said: He fed them bread and meat (so lavishly) that they (the guests) abandoned it (of their own accord after having taken them to their hearts' content).
1428.05 | Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) reported:When Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) married Zainab bint jahsh, he invited people (to the wedding feast) and they ate food. They then sat there and entered into conversation. He (the Holy Prophet) made a stir as if he was preparing to stand up, but (the persons busy in talking) did not stand up. When he (the Holy Prophet) saw it, he stood up and when he did so, some other persons stood up. 'Asim and Abd al-A'la in their narrations made this addition: Three (persons) sat there, and Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came there to enter (the apartment) but he found the people sitting there. Then they stood up and went away. He said: Then I came and informed Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) that they had gone away. He (the Holy Prophet) then came there until he entered (the apartment). I also went and was about to enter, when he hung a curtain between me and him (and it was on this occasion that) Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse:" O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished to the (words)" Surely this is serious in the sight of Allah" (xxxiii. 53).
1428.06 | Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) reported:I was the best informed among the people pertaining to Hijab (veil and seclusion). Ubayy b. Ka'b used to ask me about it. Anas (Allah be pleased with him) thus narrated: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up in the morning as a bridegroom of Zainab bint jahsh (Allah be pleased witt her) as he had married her at Medina. He invited people to the wedding feast after the day had well risen. There sat Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and there kept sitting along with him some persons after the people had stood up (for departure) ; then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up and walked on and I also walked along with him until he reached the door of the apartment of 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her). He then thought that they (those who had been sitting there after meal) had gone away. So he returned and I also returned with him, but they were still sitting at their places. So he returned for the second time and I also returned until he reached the apartment of 'A'isha. He again returned and I also returned and they had (by that time) stood up, and he hung a curtain between me and him (at the door of the apartment of Hadrat Zainab, where he had to stay), and Allah revealed the verse pertaining to veil.
1428.07 | Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) contracted marriage and he went to his wife. My mother Umm Sulaim prepared hais and placed it in an earthen vessel and said: Anas, take it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and say: My mother has sent that to you and she offers greetings to you, and says that it is a humble gift for you on our behalf, Messenger of Allah. So I went along with it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: My mother offers you salutations, and says that it is a humble gift for you on our behalf. He said: Place it here, and then said: Go and invite on my behalf so and so and anyone whom you meet, and he even named some persons. He (Anas) said: I invited whom he had named and whom I met. I (one of the narrators) said: I said to Anas: How many (persons) were there? He (Anas) said: They were about three hundred persons. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (said to me): Anas, bring that earthen vessel. They (the guests) then began to enter until the courtyard and the apartment were fully packed. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Make a circle of ten (guests), and every person should eat from that nearest to him. They began to eat, until they ate to their fill. A group went out (after eating the food), and another group came in until all of them had eaten. He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Anas, lift it (the earthen vessel), so I lifted it, but I could not assess whether it had more (food) when I placed it (before Allah's Messenger) or when I lifted it (after the people had been served out of it). A group among them (the guests) began to talk in the house of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting and his wife had been sitting with her face turned towards the wall. It was troublesome for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out and greeted his wives. He then returned. When they (the guests) saw that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had returned they thought that it (their overstay) was something troublesome for him. He (the narrator) said: They hastened towards the door and all of them went out. And there came Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he hung a curtain and went in, and I was sitting in his apartment and he did not stay but for a short while. He then came to me and these verses were revealed. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came out and recited them to the people:" O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished-but when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken food, disperse not seeking to listen to talk. Surely this gives the Prophet trouble", to the end of verse (xxxiii. 53). (Al-Ja'd said that Anas [b. Malik] stated: I am the first amongst the people to hear these verses), and henceforth the wives of the Apostle (ﷺ) began to observe seclusion (al-hijab).
1428.08 | Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported:When Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) contracted marriage with Zainab (Allah be pleased with bet), Umm Sulaim sent him hats in a vessel of stone as a gift. Anas stated that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: Go and invite on my behalf all the Muslims whom you meet. So I invited on his behalf everyone whom I met. They entered (his house) and they ate and went out. And Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had kept his hand on the food, and he invoked blessing on that, and said whatever Allah wished him to say, and none whom I met was left uninvited. They ate to their fill and went out, but a group among them remained there and was engaged in lengthy discussion. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) felt shy of saying them anything. So he went out and left them in his house and Allah the Great and Majestic revealed this verse:" 0 you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished." Qatada (instead of using the word Ghaira Nazirina) used the word Ghaira Mutahayyinina (i. e. not waiting for the time of the food). But when you are invited, enter..." up to this verse. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts.

But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him?

I said: Messenger of Allah, I am newly wedded. whereupon he said: Is it a virgin that you have married or one previously married? I said: With one previously married. He said: Why not a young girl so that you could play with her and she could play with you? Then when we arrived at and were about to enter Medina he said: Wait, so that we may enter by night (i. e. in the evening) in order that the woman with dishevelled hair may comb it, and the woman whose husband had been away may get herself clean; and when you enter (then you have the) enjoyment (of tho wife's company).
715.09 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him) reported:I went out with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on an expedition, but my camel delayed me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me and said to me: Jabir, I said: Yes. Allah's Messenger, (here I am at your beck and call) He said: What is the matter with you? I said: My camel has delayed me and is tired, so I have lagged behind. He (the Holy Prophet) got down and goaded it with a crooked stick and then said: Mount it. So I mounted and (to my great surprise) I saw it (moving so quickly that) I had to restrain it (from going ahead of) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He (the Holy Prophet) (in the course of journey said to me): Have you married? I said: Yes. He (again) said: Is it with a virgin or one previously married? I said. With one previously married, whereupon he (again) said: Why not with a young girl with whom you could sport and she could have sported with you? I said: I have sisters, so I preferred to marry a woman who could keep them together (as one family). who could comb them and look after them. He said: You are about to go (to your house), and there you have the enjoyment (of the wife's company). He again said: Do you want to sell your camel? I said: Yes. So he bought it from me for one u'qiya (of silver), Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived (at Medina) and I arrived in the evening. I went to the mosque and found him at the door of the mosque, and said: Is it now that you have arrived? I said: Yes, He said: Leave your camel, and enter (the mosque) and offer two rak'ahs. So I entered and offered two rak'ahs of prayer, and then returned. He (the Holy Prophet) then commanded Bilal to weigh out one 'uqiya (of silver) tor me. Bilal weighed that out for me (lowering the scale of) balance. So I proceeded and as I turned my back he said: Call for me, Jabir. So I was called back, and I said (to myself): He would return me the camel, and nothing was more displeasing to me than this (that after having received the price I should also get the camel). He said: Take your camel and keep its price with you, (also).
715.10 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:We were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in a journey, and I was riding a camel meant for carrying water and it lagged behind all persons. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) hit it or goaded it (I think) with something he had with him. And after it (it moved so quickly) that it went ahead of all persons and it struggled with me (to move faster than I permitted It) and I had to restrain it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Do you sell it at such and such (price)? May Allah grant you pardon. I said: Allah's Apostle, it is yours. He (again) said: Do you sell it at such and such (price)? May Allah grant you pardon. ' I said: Allah's Apostle, it is yours. He said to me: Have you married after the death of your father? I said: Yes. He (again) said: With one previously married or a virgin? I said: With one previously married. He said: Why didn't you marry a virgin who might amuse you and you might amuse her, and she might sport with you and you might sport with her? Abu Nadra said: That was the common phrase which the Muslims spoke:" You do such and such (thing) and Allah may grant you pardon."
715.11 | 'Abdullah b. Amr reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The whole world is a provision, and the best object of benefit of the world is the pious woman.
715.12 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Woman is like a rib. When you attempt to straighten it, you would break it. And if you leave her alone you would benefit by her, and crookedness will remain in her.
1467.01 | A hadith like this is reported by another chain of narrators.
1467.02 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported:Woman has been created from a rib and will in no way be straightened for you; so if you wish to benefit by her, benefit by her while crookedness remains in her. And if you attempt to straighten her, you will break her, and breaking her is divorcing her.
1468.01 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:He who believes in Allah and the Hereafter, if he witnesses any matter he should talk in good terms about it or keep quiet. Act kindly towards woman, for woman is created from a rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is its top. If you attempt to straighten it, you will break it, and if you leave it, its crookedness will remain there. So act kindly towards women.
1468.02 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:A believing man should not hate a believing woman; if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will be pleased with another.
1469 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him).
1470.01 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Had it not been for Eve, woman would have never acted unfaithfully towards her husband.
1470.02 | Hammam b. Munabbih said:These are some of the ahadith which Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) narrated to us from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and one of these (this one): Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Had it not been for Bani Isra'il, food would not have become stale, and meal would not have gone bad; and had it not been for Eve, a woman would never have acted unfaithfully toward her husband.
1471.01 | Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). 'Umar b. Khattib (Allah be pleased with him) asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Command him ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) to take her back (and keep her) and pronounce divorce when she is purified and she again enters the period of menstruation and she is again purified (after passing the period of menses), and then if he so desires he may keep her and if he desires divorce her (finally) before touching her (without having an intercourse with her), for that is the period of waiting ('ldda) which God, the Exalted and Glorious, has commanded for the divorce of women.
1471.02 | Abdullah (b. 'Umar) reported that he divorced a wife of his with the pronouncement of one divorce during the period of menstruation. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded him to take her back and keep her until she was purified, and then she entered the period of menses in his (house) for the second time. And he should wait until she was purified of her menses. And then if he would decide to divorce her, he should do so when she was purified before having a sexual intercourse with her; for that was the 'Idda which Allah had commanded for the divorce of women. Ibn Rumh in his narration made this addition:When 'Abdullah was asked about it, he said to one of them: If you have divorced your wife with one pronouncement or two (then you can take her back), for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded me to do it; but if you have divorced her with three pronouncements, then she is forbidden for you until she married another husband, and you disobeyed Allah in regard to the divorce of your wife what He had commanded you. (Muslim said: The word" one divorce" used by Laith is good.)
1471.03 | Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported:I divorced my wife during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when she was in the state of menses. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) made a mention of it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whereupon he said: Command him to take her back and leave her (in that state) until she is purified. Then (let her) enter the period of second menses, and when she is purified, then divorce her (finally) before having a sexual intercourse with her, or retain her (finally). That is the 'Idda (the prescribed period) which Allah commanded (to be kept in view) while divorcing the women. 'Ubaidullah reported: I said to Nafi': What became of that divorce (pronounced within 'Idda)? He said: It was as one which she counted.
1471.04 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of 'Ubaidullah, but he made no mention of the words of Ubaidullah that he said to Nafi'.
1471.05 | Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife during the period of menses. 'Umar (Allah be, pleas'ed with him) asked Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), and he commanded him ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) to have her back and then allow her respite until she enters the period of the second menses, and then allow her respite until she is purified, then divorce her (finally) before touching her (having a sexual intercourse with her), for that is the prescribed period which Allah commanded (to be kept in view) for divorcing the women. When Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) was asked about the person who divorces his wife in the state of menses, he said:If you pronounced one divorce or two, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had commanded him to take her back, and then allow her respite until she enters the period of the second menses, and then allow her respite until she is purified, and then divorce her (finally) before touching her (having a sexual intercourse with her) ; and if you have pronounced (three divorces at one and the same time) you have in fact disobeyed your Lord with regard to what He commanded you about divorcing your wife. But she is however (finally separated from you).
1471.06 | Abdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported:I divorced my wife while she was in the state of menses. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) made mention of it to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he was enraged and he said: Command him to take her back until she enters the second ensuing menses other than the one in which he divorced her and in case he deems proper to divorce her, he should pronounce divorce (finally) before touching her (in the period) when she is purified of her menses, and that is the prescribed period in regard to divorce as Allah has commanded. 'Abdullah made a pronouncement of one divorce and it was counted in case of divorce. 'Abdullah took her back as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had commanded him.
1471.07 | A hadith like this was reported on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of narrators. Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them), however, said:I took her back, and counted this pronouncement of divorce (as valid) with which I divorced her.
1471.08 | Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife while she was in the state of menses. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) made mention of it to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he said:Command him to take her back, then divorce her when she is pure or she is pregnant.
1471.09 | Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife while she was in her menses.

Then either divorce her (finally) or retain her.
1471.10 | Ibn Sirin reported:One who was blameless (as a narrator) narrated to me for twenty years that Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) pronounced three divorces to his wife while she was in the state of menses. He was commanded to take her back. I neither blamed them (the narrators) nor recognised the hadith (to be perfectly genuine) until I met Abu Ghallab Yunus b. Jubair al-Bahili and he was very authentic, and he narrated to me that he had asked Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with there) and he narrated it to him that he made one pronouncement of divorce to his wife as she was in the state of menses, but he was commanded to take her back. I said: Was it counted (as one pronouncement)? He said: Why not, was I helpless or foolish?
1471.11 | A hadith like this has been transmitted on the authority of Ayyub with a slight variation of words.
1471.12 | Ayyub reported a hadith like this with the same chain of narrators and he said:Umar (Allah be pleased with him) asked Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) about it and he commanded him that he should take her back until she is divorced in the state of purity without having a sexual intercourse with her, and said: Divorce her in the beginning of her 'Idda or her 'Idda commences.
1471.13 | Yunus b. Jubair reported:I said to Ibn'Umar (Allah be pleased with them): A person divorcedhis wife while she was in the state of menses, whereupon he said: Do you know 'Abdullah b. Umar (Allah be pleased with them), for he divorced his wife in the state of menses. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and asked him, and he (the Holy Prophet) commanded him that he should take her back, and she started her 'Idda. I said to him: When a person divorces his wife, and she is in the state of menses, should that pronouncement of divorce be counted? He said: Why not, was he hopless or foolish?
1471.14 | Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported:I divorced my wife while she was in the state of menses. 'Umar (Allah he pleased wish him) came toAllah's Apostle (ﷺ) and made mention of that to him, whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) told that be should take her back, and when she is pure he may divorce her. if he would so wish. I (one of the narrators) said to Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them): Did you count (this pronouncement of divorce) in her case? He said: What (after all) prevents him from doing so? Do you find him (Ibn Umar) either helpless or foolish?
1471.15 | Anas b. Sirin reported:I asked Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) about the woman whom he had divorced. He said: I divorced her while she was in the state of menses. It was mentioned to 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) and he then made a mention of that to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), whereupon he said: Command him to take her back and when the period of menses is over, then (he may divorce her in the state of her purity. He (Ibn Umar) said: So I took her back, then divorced her in her purity. I (the narrator) said: Did you count that divorce which you pronounced in the state of menses? He said: Why should I not have counted that? Was I helpless or foolish?
1471.16 | Anas b. Sirin reported that he had heard Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) as saying. I divorced my wife while she was in the state of menses. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and informed him about it, whereupon he (Allah's Apostle) said:Command him to take her back and when she is pure, then divorce her. I said to Ibn 'Umar Allah be pleased with them): Did you count that pronouncement of divorce? He said: Why not?

1471.18 | Ibn Tawus narrated on the authority of his father that Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) was asked about the person who divorced his wife in the state of menses, whereupon he said:Do you know 'Abdullah b. Umar? He said: Yes.

1471.19 | Abu Zubair reported that he heard 'Abd al-Rahman b. Aiman (the freed slave of 'Azza) say that he asked Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) and Abu Zubair heard:What is your opinion about the person who divorced his wife in the state of menses? Thereupon he said: Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) divorced his wife during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while she was in the state of menses. Upon this Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told him to take her back and so he took her back and he (further) said: When she is pure, then either divorce her or retain her. Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) said that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) then recited this verse:" O Apostle, when you divorce women, divorce them at the commencement of their prescribed period" (Ixv 1).
1471.20 | The story in the above hadith has likewise been narrated through another chain.
1471.21 | A hadith like this is reported on the same authority (but with this difference that the narrator) 'Abd al-Rahman b. Aiman (was mentioned) as the freed slave of 'Urwa (Imam Muslim said:He made a mistake who said that it was 'Urwa; it was in fact the freed slave of 'Azza.)
1472.01 | Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that the (pronouncement) of three divorces during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and that of Abu Bakr and two years of the caliphate of Umar (Allah be pleased with him) (was treated) as one. But Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) said:Verily the people have begun to hasten in the matter in which they are required to observe respite. So if we had imposed this upon them, and he imposed it upon them.
1472.02 | Abu Sahba' said toIbn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them):Do you know that three (divorces) were treated as one during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), and that of Abu Bakr, and during three (years) of the caliphate of Umar (Allah be pleased with him)? Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) said: Yes.
1472.03 | Abu al-Sahba' said to Ibn 'Abbas:Enlighten us with your information whether the three divorces (pronounced at one and the same time) were not treated as one during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr. He said: It was in fact so, but when during the caliphate of 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) people began to pronounce divorce frequently, he allowed them to do so (to treat pronouncements of three divorces in a single breath as one).
1473.01 | Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported about (declaring of one's woman) unlawful as an oath which must be atoned, and Ibn 'Abbas said:Verily, there is in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) a model pattern for you.

1474.01 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) narrated that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) used to spend time with Zainab daughter of Jahsh and drank honey at her house. She ('A'isha further) said:I and Hafsa agreed that one whom Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) would visit first should say: I notice that you have an odour of the Maghafir (gum of mimosa). He (the Holy Prophet) visited one of them and she said to him like this, whereupon he said: I have taken honey in the house of Zainab bint Jabsh and I will never do it again. It was at this (that the following verse was revealed): 'Why do you hold to be forbidden what Allah has made lawful for you... (up to). If you both ('A'isha and Hafsa) turn to Allah" up to:" And when the Prophet confided an information to one of his wives" (lxvi. 3). This refers to his saying: But I have taken honey.
1474.02 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) liked sweet (dish) and honey. After saying the afternoon prayer he used to visit his wives going close to them. So he went to Hafsa and stayed with her more than what was his usual stay. I ('A'isha) asked about that. It was said to me:A woman of her family had sent her a small vessel of honey as a gift, and she gave to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from that a drink. I said: By Allah, we would also contrive a device for him. I mentioned that to Sauda, and said: When he (Allah's Apostle) would visit you and draw close to you, say to him: Allah's Messenger, have you taken maghafir? And he would'say to you: No. Then say to him: What is this odour? And Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) felt it very much that unpleasant odour should emit from him. So he would say to you: Hafsa has given me a drink of honey. Then you should say to him: The honey-bees might have sucked 'Urfut, and I would also say the same to him and. Safiyya, you should also say this. So when he (the Holy Prophet) came to Sauda, she said: By Him besides whom there is no god, it was under compulsion that I had decided to state that which you told me when he would be at a little distance at the door. So when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came near, she said: Messenger of Allah, did you eat Maghafir? He said: No. She (again) said: Then what is this odour? He said: Hafsa gave me honey to drink. She said: The honey-bee might have sucked 'Urfut. When he came to me I told him like this. He then visited Safiyya and she also said to him like this. When he (again) visited Hafsa, she said: Messenger of Allah, should I not give you that (drink)? He said: I do not need that. Sauda said: Hallowed be Allah, by Him we have (contrived) to make that (honey) unlawful for him. I said to her: Keep quiet.
1474.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Urwa with the same chain of transmitters.

She said that he already knew that my parents would never allow me to seek separation from him She said: Then he said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: Prophet, say to thy wives: If you desire this world's life and its adornment, then come, I will give you a provision and allow you to depart a goodly departing; and if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward She is reported to have said: About what should I consult my parents, for I desire Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter? She ('A'isha) said: Then all the wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did as I had done.
1476.01 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sought our permission when he had a (turn to spend) a day with (one of his wives) amongst us (whereas he wanted to visit his other wives too).

Mu'adha said to her: What did you say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when he sought your permission? She said: I used to say: If it had the option in this I would not have (allowed anyone) to have precedence over me.

1478 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) came and sought permission to see Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He found people sitting at his door and none amongst them had been granted permission, but it was granted to Abu Bakr and he went in. Then came 'Umar and he sought permission and it was granted to him, and he found Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) sitting sad and silent with his wives around him. He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: I would say something which would make the Prophet (ﷺ) laugh, so he said: Messenger of Allah, I wish you had seen (the treatment meted out to) the daughter ofKhadija when you asked me some money, and I got up and slapped her on her neck. Allah's Messenger (mav peace be upon him) laughed and said: They are around me as you see, asking for extra money. Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) then got up went to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and slapped her on the neck, and 'Umar stood up before Hafsa and slapped her saying: You ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which he does not possess. They said: By Allah, we do not ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for anything he does not possess. Then he withdrew from them for a month or for twenty-nine days. Then this verse was revealed to him:" Prophet: Say to thy wives... for a mighty reward" (xxxiii. 28). He then went first to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and said: I want to propound something to you, 'A'isha, but wish no hasty reply before you consult your parents. She said: Messenger of Allah, what is that? He (the Holy Prophet) recited to her the verse, whereupon she said: Is it about you that I should consult my parents, Messenger of Allah? Nay, I choose Allah, His Messenger, and the Last Abode; but I ask you not to tell any of your wives what I have said He replied: Not one of them will ask me without my informing her. God did not send me to be harsh, or cause harm, but He has sent me to teach and make things easy.
1479.01 | 'Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported:When Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) kept himself away from his wives, I entered the mosque, and found people striking the ground with pebblesand saying: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has divorced his wives, and that was before they were commanded to observe seclusion 'Umar said to himself: I must find this (actual position) today. So I went to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and said (to her): Daughter of Abu Bakr, have you gone to the extent of giving trouble to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? Thereupon she said: Son of Khattab, you have nothing to do with me, and I have nothing to do with you. You should look to your own receptacle. He ('Umar) said: I visited Hafsa daughter of 'Umar, and said to her: Hafsa, the (news) has reached me that you cause Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) trouble. You know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) does not love you, and had I not been (your father) he would have divorced you. (On hearing this) she wept bitterly. I said to her: Where is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? Shesaid: He is in the attic room. I went in and found Rabah, the servant of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), sitting on the thresholds of the window dangling his feet on the hollow wood of the date-palm with the help of which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) climbed (to the apartment) and came down. I cried: 0 Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him). Rabah cast a glance at the apartment and then looked toward me but said nothing. I again said: Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Rabah looked towards the apartment and then cast a glance at me, but said nothig. I then raised my voice and said: 0 Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I think that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is under the impression that I have come for the sake of Hafsa. By Allah, if Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would command me to strike her neck, I would certainly strike her neck. I raised my voice and he pointed me to climb up (and get into his apartment). I visited Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and he was lying on a mat. I sat down and he drew up his lower garment over him and he had nothing (else) over him, and that the mat had left its marks on his sides. I looked with my eyes in the store room of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I found only a handful of barley equal to one sa' and an equal quantity of the leaves of Mimosa Flava placed in the nook of the cell, and a semi-tanned leather bag hanging (in one side), and I was moved to tears (on seeing this extremely austere living of the Holy Piophet), and he said: Ibn Khattab, what wakes you weep? I said: Apostle of Allah, why should I not shed tears? This mat has left its marks on your sides and I do not see in your store room (except these few things) that I have seen; Ceasar and Closroes are leading their lives in plenty whereas you are Allah's Messenger. His chosen one, and that is your store! He said: Ibn Khattab, aren't you satisfied that for us (there should be the prosperity) of the Hereafter, and for them (there should be the prosperity of) this world? I said: Yes. And as I had entered I had seen the signs of anger on his face, and I therefore, said: Messenger of Allah, what trouble do you feel from your wives, and if youhave divorced them, verily Allah is with you, His angels, Gabriel, Mika'il, I and Abu Bakr and the believers are with you. And seldom I talked and (which I uttered on that day) I hoped that Allah would testify to my words that I uttered. And so the verse of option (Ayat al-Takhyir) was revealed. Maybe his Lord, if he divorce you, will give him in your place wives better than you..." (Ixv. 5). And if you back up one another against him, then surely Allah is his Patron, and Gabriel and the righteous believers, and the angels after that are the aidera (lvi. 4). And it was 'A'isha, daughter of Abu Bakr, and Hafsa who had prevailed upon all the wives of Allah's Prophet (way peace be upon him) for (pressing them for mote money). I said: Messenger of Allah, have you divorced them? He said: No. I said: Messenger of Allah, I entered the mosque and found the Muslims playing with pebbles (absorbed in thought) and saying: Allah's Messenger has divorced his wives. Should I get down and inform there that you have not divorced them? He said: Yes, if you so like. And I went on talking to him until I (found) the signs of anger disappeared on his face and (his seriousness was changed to a happy mood and as a result thereof) his face had the natural tranquillity upon it and he laughed and his teeth were the most charming (among the teeth) of all people. Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) climbed down and I also climbed down and catching hold of the wood of the palm-tree and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came down (with such ease) as if he was walking on the ground, not touching anything with his hand (to get support). I said: Messenger of Allah, you remained in your apartment for twenty-nine days. He said: (At times) the month consists of twenty-nine days. I stood at the door of the mosque and I called out at the top of my voice: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has not divorced his wives (and it was on this occasion that this) verse was revealed:" And if any matter pertaining to peace or alarm comes within their ken, they broadcast it; whereas, if they would refer it to the Apostle and those who have been entrusted with authority amongst them, those of them who are engaged in obtaining intelligence would indeed know (what to do with) it" (iv 83). And it was I who understood this matter, and Allah revealed the verse pertaining to option (given to the Prophet (may peace be upon him in regard to the retaining or divorcing of his wives).
1479.02 | Abdullah b. Abbas (Allah be pleased with tlicm) reported:I intended to ask 'Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) about a verse, but I waited for one year to ask him out of his fear, until he went out for Pilgrimage and I also accompanied him. As he came back and we were on the way he stepped aside towards an Arak tree to ease himself. I waited for him until he was free. I then walked along with him and said: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two among the wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who backed up one another (in their demand for extra money)? He said: They were Hafsa and 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with them). I said to him: It is for one year that I intended to ask you about this matter but I could not date so on account of the awe for you. He said: Don't do that. If you think that I have any knowledge, do ask me about that. And if I were to know that, I would inform you. He (the narrator) stated that 'Umar had said: By Allah, during the days of ignorance we had no regard for women until Allah the Exalt- ed revealed about them what He has revealed, and appointed (turn) for them what he appointed. He said: It so happened that I was thinking about some matter that my wife said: I wish you had done that and that. I said to her: It does not concern you and you should not feel disturbed in a matter which I intend to do. She said to me: How strange is it that you, O son of Khattab, do not like anyone to retort upon you, whereas your daughter retorts upon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upou him) until he spends the day in vexation. 'Umar said: I took hold of my cloak, then came out of my house until I visited Hafsa and said to her: O daughter, (I heard) that you retort upon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) until he spends the day in vexation, whereupon Hafsa said: By Allah, we do retort upon him. I said: You should bear in mind, my daughter, that I warn you against the punishment of Allah and the wrath of His Messenger (ﷺ). You may not be misled by one whose beauty has fascinated her, and the love of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for her. I ('Umar) then visited Umm Salama because of my relationship with her and I talked to her. Umm Salama said to me: Umar b. al-Khattab, how strange is it that you meddle with every matter so much so that you are anxious to interfere between Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his wives, and this perturbed me so much that I refrained from saying what I had to say, so I came out of her apartment, and I had a friend from the Anar. When I had been absent (from the company of the Holy Prophet) he used to bring me the news and when he had been absent I used to bring him the news, and at that time we dreaded a king of Ghassan. It was mentioned to us that he intended to attack us, and our minds were haunted by him. My friend, the Ansari, came to me, and he knocked at the door and said: Open it, open it. I said: Has the Ghassani come? He said: (The matter is) more serious than that. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has separated himself from his wives. I said: Let the nose of Hafsa and 'A'isha be besmeared with dust. I then took hold of my cloth and went out until I came and found Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in his attic to which he climbed by means of a ladder made of date-palm, and the servant of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who was black had been sitting at the end of the ladder. I said: This is Umar. So permission was granted to me. I narrated this news to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and as I narrated the news concerning Umm Salama, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled. He was lying on the mat and there was nothing between him and that (mat), and under his head there was a pillow made of leather and it was stuffed with plam fibres and at his feet were lying a heap of sant tree (acacia niloctica, meant for dyeing) and near his head there was hanging a hide. And I saw the marks of the maton the side of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and so I wept. He said: What makes you weep? I said: Messenger of Allah, the Khusrau and the Ceasars (spendd their lives in) the midst of (luxuries), whereas you being Allah's Messenger (are leading your life in this poverty). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Don't you like that they should have riches of their world, and you have the Hereafter.
1479.03 | Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) said:I came along with Umar until we reached Marr al-Zahran (the name of a place), and the rest of the hadith is the same as narrated by Sulaiman b. Bilal (except with) the variation (of words) that I said: (What) about these two women? He said: They were Hafsa and Umm Salama. And he made this addition: I came to the apartments and in every apartment there was (the noise) of weeping. And this addition was also made: And he (the Holy Prophet) had taken an oath of remaining away from them for a month, and when twenty-nine days had passed, he visited them.
1479.04 | Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) is reported to have said:I intended to ask Umar about those two ladies who had pressed for (worldly riches) during the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ), and I kept waiting for one year, but found no suitable opportunity with him until I happened to accompany him to Mecca. And as he reached Marr al Zahran he went away to answer the call of nature, and he said (to me): Bring me a jug of water, and I took that to him. After having answered the call of nature, as he came back, I began to pour water (over his hands and feet), and I remembered (this event of separation of Allah's Apostle [may peace be upon him] from his wives). So I said to him: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two ladies (who had pressed the Prophet [may peace be upon him] for providing comforts of life) and I had not yet finished my talk when he said: They were 'A'isha and Hafsa.
1479.05 | Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported. I had always been anxious to ask 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) about the two ladies amongst the wives of Allah's Prophet (may peace be upon Lim) about whom Allah, the Exalted, said:" If you both turn in repentance to Allah, then indeed your hearts are inclined (to this)" (Ixvi. 4), until 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) set out for Hajj and I also went along with him. And as we were going along a path, 'Umar (Allah be pleased with hiyn) went aside and I also went aside with him with a jug (of water). He answered the call of nature, and then came to me and I poured water over his hands and he performed ablution I said: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two ladies amongst the wives of Allah's Prophet (ﷺ) about whom Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, said: 'If you both turn to Allah in repentance, then indeed your heart are inclined to it"? 'Umar (Allah he pleased with him) said: How strange is it for you, Ibn 'Abbas! (Zuhri said: By Allah, he disliked what he asked about, but did not keep it a secret.) He ('Umar) said: They are Hafsa and 'A'isha; and he then began to narrate the hadith and said: We were such people among the Quraish who dominated women, and as we reached Medina we found there people who were dominated by their women, and our women began to learn (the habits) of their women. He further said: And my house was situated in the suburb of Aledina in the tribe of Banu Umayya b. Zaid. One day I became angry with my wife and she retorted upon me. I did not like that she should retort upon me. She said: You disapprove of my retorting upon you By Allah, the wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) retort upon him, and one of them detaches herself from him for the day until the night. So I ('Umar) went out and visited Hafsa and said: Do you retort upon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? She said: Yes. I said; Does any one of you detach herself from him from the day to the night? She said: Yes. He said: She who did like it amongst you in fact failed and incurred loss. Does everyone amongst you not fear the wrath of Allah upon her due to the wrath of His Messenger (ﷺ), and (as a result thereof) she may perish? So do not retort upon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and do not ask him for anything, but ask me that which you desire, (and the frank behaviour) of your companion may not mislead you, if she is more graceful and is dearer to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) than you (meaning 'A'isha) (Allah be pleased with her). He (Hadrat 'Umar further) said: I had a compalaion from the Ansar and, we used to remain in the company of the Messenger (ﷺ) turn by turn. He remained there for a day while I remained there on the other day, and he brought me the news about the revelation and other (matter), and I brought him (the news) like this. And we discussed that the Ghassanids were shoeing the horses in order to attack us. Id y companion once attended (the Apostle). and then came to me at night and knocked at my door and called me, and I came out to him, and he said: A matter of great importance has happened. I said: What is that? Have the Ghassanids come? He said: No, but even more serious and more significant than that: the Prophet (ﷺ) has divorced his wives. I said: Hafsa has failed and has incurred loss. and I feared that it would happen. When it was dawn I observed the dawn prayer and dressed myself, and then came there (in the house of the Holy Prophet) and visited Hafsa, and she was weeping. I said: Has Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) divorced you (all)? She said: I do not know. He has, however, separated himself in his attic. I came to a black servant and said to him: Seek permission for 'Umar. He went in and then came to me and said: I made mention of you to him, but he kept quiet. I then went to the pulpit and sat there, and there was a group of people sitting by it and some of then were weeping. I sat there for some time, until I was overpowered (by that very idea) which was in my mind. I then came back to the boy and said to him: Seek permission for Umar. He went in and came to me and said: I made mention of you to him but he kept quiet. I was about to turn back when the boy called me and said: Go in; permission has been granted to you. I went in and greeted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he was reclining against the couch of mat and it had left its marks upon his side. I said: Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives? He raised his head towards me and said: No. I said: Allah is the Greatest. Messenger of Allah, I wish if you had seen how we the people of Quraish had domination over women but when we came to Medina we found people whom their women dominated. So our women began to learn from their women. One dily I became angry with my wife and she began to retort upon me. I did not approve that she should retort upon me. She said: You do not like that I should retort upon you, but, by Allah. the wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) retort upon him and any one of them separates herself from him for a day until night. I said: He who did that amongst them in fact failed and incurred loss. Does any of them feel sate from the wrath of Allahupon her due to the wrath of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and she has certainly perished. Allah's Messtnger (ﷺ) smiled, I said: Messenger of Allah, I visited Hafsa and said: (The behaviour) of your companion ('A'isha) may not mislead you, If she is more graceful than you and is dearer to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) than you. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled for the second time. I said: Allah's Messenger, way I talk to you about agreeable things? He said: Yes. I sat down and lifted my head (to see things) in the house and, by Allah, I did not see anything significant besides three hides. I said: Messenger of Allah, supplicate the Lord that He should make (life) prosperous for your Ummah as He has made plentiful for the people of Persia and Rome (in spite of the fact) that they do no, worship Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, whereupon he (Allah's Messenger) sat up an I then said: Ibn Khattab, do you doubt that they are a nation whom their nice things have been given immediately in the life of this world. I said: Allah's Messenger! seek pardon for me. And he (Allah's Messenger) had taken an oath that he would not visit them for a month due to extreme annoyance with them until Allah showed His displeasure to him (Allah's Messenger). Zuhri said: 'Urwa informed me that 'A'Isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: When twenty-nine nights were over, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) visited me, and he began (his visit) with me. I said: Messenger of Allah, you had taken an oath that you would not visit us for a month, while you have visited after I have counted only twenty-nine (nights). Thereupon he said: The month may also be of twenty-nine (days). He then said: 'A'isha, I am going to talk to you about a matter, and you should not be hasty in it (and do not give your final decision) until you have consulted your parents. He then recited this verse to me:" O Prophet, say to your wives" till he reached" mighty reward" (xxxiii. 28). 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: By Allah, he knew that my parents would not allow me to separate from him. I said: Is there any need to consult my parents in this matter? I in fact choose Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ) and the abode in the Hereafter. Ma'mar said: Ayyub reported to me that 'A'isha said: Don't inform your wives that I have chosen you, whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Verily Allah has sent me as a conveyer of message, and He has not sent me as a source of hardship (to others). Qatada said:" Saghat qulubukum" means" Your hearts have inclined."
1480.01 | Fatima bint Qais reported that Abu 'Amr b. Hafs divorced her absolutely when he was away from home, and he sent his agent to her with some barley. She was displeased with him and when he said:I swear by Allah that you have no claim on us. she went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. He said: There is no maintenance due to you from him, and he commanded her to spend the 'Idda in the house of Umm Sharik, but then said: That is a woman whom my companions visit. So better spend this period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man and yon can put off your garments. And when the 'Idda is over, inform me. She said: When my period of 'Idda was over, I mentioned to him that Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan and Jahm had sent proposal of marriage to me, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: As for Abu Jahm, he does not put down his staff from his shoulder, and as for Mu'awiya, he is a poor man having no property; marry Usama b. Zaid. I objected to him, but he again said: Marry Usama; so I married him. Allah blessed there in and I was envied (by others).
1480.02 | Fatima bint Qais reported that her husband divorced her during the life time of Allah's Prophet (ﷺ) and gave her a meagre maintenance allowance. When she saw that, she said:By Allah, I will inform Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and if maintenance allowance is due to me then I will accept that which will suffice me, and if it is not due to me, I will not accept anything from him. She said: I made a mention of that to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he said: There is neither maintenance allowance for you nor lodging.
1480.03 | Fatima bint Qais reported that her husband al-Makhzulmi divorced her and refused to pay her maintenance allowance. So she came to Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) and informed him, whereupon he said:There is no maintenance allowance for you, and you better go to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum and live with him for he is a blind man and you can put off your clothes in his house (i. e. you shall not face much difficulty in observing purdah there).
1480.04 | Abu Salama reported that Fatima bint Qais, the sister of al-Dahhak b. Qais informed him that Abu Hafs b. Mughira al-Makhzumi divorced her three times and then he proceeded on to the Yemen. The members of his family said to her:There is no maintenance allowance due to you from us. Khalid b. Walid along with a group of persons visited Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the house of Maimuna and they said: Abu Hafs has divorced his wife with three pronouncements; is there any maintenance allowance due to her? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: No maintenance allowance is due to her, but she is required to spend the 'Idda; and he sent her the message that she should not be hasty in making a decision about herself and commanded her to move to the house of Umm Sharik, and then sent her the message that as the first immigrants (frequently) visit the house of Umm Sharik, she should better go to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, the blind, (and further said: In case you put off your head-dress, he (Ibn Umm Makhtum) will not see you. So she went to his house, and when the 'Idda was over, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) married her to Usama b. Zaid b. Haritha.
1480.05 | Fatima bint Qais reported:I had been married to a person from Banu Makhzum and he divorced me with irrevocable divorce. I sent a message to his family asking for maintenance allowance, and the rest of the hadith has been transmitted with a slight change of words.
1480.06 | Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported that she had been married to Abu 'Amr b. Hafs b. al-Mughira and he divorced her with three pronouncements. She stated that she went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asking him about abandoning that house. He commanded her to move to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, the blind. Marwan refused to testify the divorced woman abandoning her house (before the 'Idda was over). 'Urwa said that 'A'isha objected to (the words of) Fatima bint Qais.
1480.07 | This hadith has been transmitted through another chain of narrators.
1480.08 | 'Ubaidullah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba reported that 'Amr b. Hafs b. al-Mughira set out along with 'Ali b. Abi Talib (Allah be pleased with him) to the Yemen and sent to his wife the one pronouncement of divorce which was still left from the (irrevocable) divorce; and he commanded al-Harith b. Hisham and 'Ayyash b. Abu Rabi'a to give her maintenance allowance. They said to her:By Allah, there is no maintenance allowance for you, except in case you are pregnant. She came to Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) and mentioned their opinion to him, whereupon he said: There is no maintenance allowance for you. Then she sought permission to move (to another place), and he (the Holy Prophet) permitted her. She said: Allah's Messenger, where (should I go)? He said: To the house of Ibn Umm Maktum and, as he is blind, she could put off her garmeqts in his presence and he would not see her. And when her 'Idda was over. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) married her to Usama b. Zaid. Marwan (the governor of Medina) sent Qabisa b. Dhuwaib in order to ask her about this hadith, and she narrated it to him, whereupon Marwan said: We have not heard this hadith but from a woman. We would adopt a safe (path) where we found the people. Fatima said that when these words of, Marwan were conveyed to her. There is between me and you the word of Allah, the Exalted and Majestic: Do" not turn them out" of their houses. She asserted: This is in regard to the revocable divorce what new (turn can the event take) after three pronouncements (separation between irrevocable). Why do you say there is no maintenance allowance for her if she is not pregnant? Then on what ground do you restrain her?
1480.09 | Sha'bi reported:I visited Fatima bint Qais and asked her about the verdict of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about (board and lodging during the 'Idda) and she said that her husband divorced her with an irrevocable divorce. She (further. said): I contended with him before Allah's Messerger (ﷺ) about lodging and maintenance allowance, and she said: He did not provide me with any lodging or maintenance allowance, and he commanded me to spend the 'Idda in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum.
1480.10 | A hadith like this has been trarismitted on the authority of Hushaim through another chain of narrators.
1480.11 | Sha'bi reported:We visited Fatima bint Qais and she served us fresh dates and a drink of barley flour, and I asked her: Where should a woman who has been divorced by three pronouncements, spend the period of her 'Idda. She said: My husband divorced me with three pronouncements, and Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) permitted me to spend my 'Idda period with my family (with my parents).
1480.12 | Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that there is no lodging and maintenance allowance for a woman who has been given irrevocable divorce.
1480.13 | Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported:My husband divorced me with three pronouncements. I decided to move (from his house to another place). So I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and he said: Move to the house of your cousin 'Amr b. Umm Maktum and spend your period of 'Idda there.
1480.14 | Abu Ishaq reported:I was with al-Aswad b. Yazid sitting in the great mosque, and there was with us al-Sha'bi, and he narrated the narration of Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not make any provision for lodging and maintenance allowance for her. Al-Aswad caught hold of some pebbles in his fist and he threw them towards him saying: Woe be to thee, you narrate like it, whereas Umar said: We cannot abandon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of our Apostle (ﷺ) for the words of a woman. We do not know whether she remembers that or she forgets. For her, there is a provision of lodging and maintenance allowance. Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, said:" Turn them not from their houses nor should they themselves go forth unless they commit an open indecency" (lxv. 1).
1480.15 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Ishaq with the same chain of transmitters.
1480.16 | Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported that her husband divorced her with three, pronouncements and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made no provision for her lodging and maintenance allowance. She (further said):Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me: When your period of 'Idda is over, inform me. So I informed him. (By that time) Mu'awiya, Abu Jahm and Usama b. Zaid had given her the proposal of marriage. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: So far as Mu'awiya is concerned, he is a poor man without any property. So far as Abu Jahm is concerned, he is a great beater of women, but Usama b. Zaid... She pointed with her hand (that she did not approve of the idea of marrying) Usama. But Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon himn) said: Obedience to Allah and obedience to His Messenger is better for thee. She said: So I married him, and I became an object of envy.
1480.17 | Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported:My husband Abu 'Amr b. Hafs b. al-Mughira sent 'Ayyish b. Abu Rabi'a to me with a divorce, and he also sent through him five si's of dates and five si's of barley. I said: Is there no maintenance allowance for me but only this, and I cannot even spend my 'Idda period in your house? He said: No. She said: I dressed myself and came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He said: How many pronouncements of divorce have been made for you? I said: Three. He said what he ('Ayyish b. Abu Rabi'a) had stated was true. There is no maintenance allowance for you. Spend 'Idda period in the house of your cousin, Ibn Umm Maktum. He is blind and you can put off your garment in his presence. And when you have spent your Idda period, you inform me. She said: Mu'awiya and Abu'l-Jahm (Allah be pleased with them) were among those who had given me the proposal of marriage. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Mu'awiya is destitute and in poor condition and Abu'l-Jahm is very harsh with women (or he beats women, or like that), you should take Usama b. Zaid (as your husband).
1480.18 | Abu Bakr b. Abu'l-Jahm reported:I and Abu Salama b 'Abd al-Rahman came to fatima bint Qais (Al! ah be pleased with her) and asked her (about divorce, etc.). She said: I was the wife of Abu 'Amr b. Hafs b. al-Mughira, and he set out to join the battle of Najran. The rest of the hadith is the same, but he made this addition:" She said: I married him and Allah hornoured me on account of Ibn Zaid and Allah favoured me because of him."
1480.19 | Abu Bakr reported:I and Abu Salama came to Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) during the time of Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) and she narrated to us that her husband gave her an irrevocable divorce. (The rest of the hadith is the same.)
1480.20 | Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported:My husband divorced me with three pronouncements and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made no provision for lodging and maintenance allowance.
1481.01 | Hisham reported on the authority of his father that Yahya b. Sa'id b. al-'As married the daughter of 'Abd al-Rahman b. al-Hakam, and he divorced her and he turned her out from his house. 'Urwa (Allah be -pleased with him) criticised this (action) of theirs (the members of the family of her in-laws). They said:Verily, Fatima too went out (of her in-laws' house). 'Urwa said: I came to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and told her about it and she said: There is no good for Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) in making mention of it.
1482 | Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported that she said:Allah's Messenger, my husband has divorcee me with three pronouncements and I am afraid that I may be put to hardship, and so he commanded her and so she moved (to another house).
1481.02 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said:It is no good for Fatima to make mention of it, i. e. her statement:" There is no lodging and maintenance allowance (for the divorced women)."
1481.03 | Ibn al-Qasim narrated on the authority of his father that 'Urwa b. Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) said to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her):Didn't you see that such and such daughter of al-Hakam was divorced by her husband with an irrevocable divorce, and she left (the house of her husband)? Thereupon 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: It was bad that she did. He ( Urwa) said: Have you not heard the words of Fatima? Thereupon she said: There if no good for her in making mention of it.
1483 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:My maternal aunt was divorced, and she intended to pluck her dates. A person scolded her for having come out (during the period of 'Idda). She came to Allah's Prophet (may peace be upon him.) and he said: Certainly you can pluck (dates) from your palm trees, for perhaps you may give charity or do an act of kindness.
1484 | 'Ubaidullah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba (b. Mas'ud) reported that his father wrote to Umar b. 'Abdullah b al Arqam al-Zuhri that he would go to Subai'ah bint al-Hirith al-Aslamiyya (Allah be pleased with her) and ask her about a verdict from him which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave her when she had asked that from him (in regard to the termination of 'Idda at the birth of a child) 'Umar b. Abdullah wrote to 'Abdullah b. 'Utba informing him that Subai'ah had told him that she had been married to Sa'd b. Khaula and he belonged to the tribe of Amir b. Lu'ayy, and was one of those who participated in the Battle of Badr, and he died in the Farewell Pilgrimage and she had been in the family way at that time. And much time had not elapsed that she gave birth to a child after his death and when she was free from the effects of childbirth she embellished herself for those who had to give proposals of marriage. Abd al-Sunabil b. Ba'kak (from Banu 'Abd al-Dar) came to her and said:What is this that I see you embellished; perhaps you are inclined to marry, By Allah, you cannot marry unless four months and ten days (of 'Idda are passed). When he said that. I dressed myself, and as it was evening I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked him about it, and he gave me a religious verdict that I was allowed to marry when I had given birth to a child and asked me to marry if I so liked. Ibn Shihab said: I do not find any harm fur her in marrying when she has given birth to a child even when she is bleeding (after the birth of the child) except that her husband should not go near her until she is purified.
1485.01 | Abu Salama b. 'Abd al-Rahman and Ibn 'Abbas. (Allah be pleased with them) got together in the house of Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) and began to discuss about the woman who gave birth to a child a few nights after the death of her husband. Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with then) ) said:Her 'Idda is that period which is longer of the two (between four months and ten days and the birth of the child, whichever is longer). AbuSalama, however said: Her period of 'Idda is over (with the birth of the child), and they were contending with each other over this issue, whereupon Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) said: I subscribe (to the view) held by my nephew (i. e. Abu Salama). They sent Kuraib (the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas) to Umm Salama to ask her about it. He came (back) to them and informed them that Umm Salama (Allah be pleased with her) said that Subai'ah al-Aslamiyya gave birth to a child after the death of her husband when the few flights (had hardly) passed and she made mention of that to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he commanded her to marry.
1485.02 | This hadith has been narated with the same chain of transrmitters except with a small change of words (and that is):They sent him to Umm Salama, but no mention was made of Kuraib.
1486.01 | Zainab (bint Abu Salama) (Allah be pleased with her) reported:I went to Umm Habiba, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), when her father Abu Sufyan had died. Umm Habiba sent for a perfume having yellowness in it or something else like it, and she applied it to a girl and then rubbed it on her cheeks and then said: By Allah, I need no perfume but for the fact that I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say on the pulpit:" It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafter to mourn for the dead beyond three days, but (in case of the death) of the husband it is permissible for four months and ten days." Zainab said: I then visited Zainab hint Jahsh (Allah be pleased with her) when her brother died and she sent for perfume and applied it and then said: By Allah, I don't feel any need for the perfume but that I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say on the pulpit:" It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafbler to mourn the dead beyond three days except in case of her husband (for whom she can mourn) for four months and ten days." Zainab (Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard my mother Umm Salama (Allah be pleased with her) as saying: A woman came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger. I have a daughter whose husband has died and there has developed some trouble in her eye; should we apply collyrium to it? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: No (repeating it twice or thrice, saying only, NO" all the time). Then he said: It is only four mouths and ten days, whereas in the preIslamic period none of you threw away the dung until one year had passed. Humaid said: I said to Zainab: What is this throwing of dung until a year is passed? Zainab said: When the husband of a woman died, she went into a hut and put on her worst clothes, and did not apply perfume or something like it until a year was over. Then an animal like a donkey, or a goat, or a bird was brought to her and she rubbed her hand over it, and it so happened that one on which she rubbed her hand died. She then came out of her house and she was given dung and she threw it and then she made use of anything like perfume or something else as she liked.
1486.02 | Zainab bint Umm Salama (Allah be pleased with her) reported that a relative of Umm Habiba (Allah he pleased with her) died. She sent for a yellow (perfume) and applied that to her forearm and said:I, am doing it, for I have heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying: It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafter to mourn beyond three days except the husband (for whom she can mourn) for four months and ten days.
1487 | This hadith was narrated by Zainab from her mother and from Zainab, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), or from some other lady from among the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ).
1488.03 | Zainab bint Umm Salama (Allah be pleased with her) reported on the authority of her mother that a woman lost her husband. (As her eyes were ailing) they (her kith and kin) entertained fear about her eyes, so they came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and sought permission for the use of collyrium, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:One among you used to spend one year in a dungeon dressed in worst clothes. (And at the end of this period) she threw dung at the dog which happened to pass that way and then she came out (of her 'Idda). Can't she (wait) even for four months and ten days?
1488.04 | Humaid b. Nafi' narrated two traditions from Umm Salama dealing with collyrium and the other hadith from the wives of Allah's Prophet (ﷺ) except with this that no mention was made of Zainab.
1486.03 | Zainab bint Abu Salama reported:Umm Salama and Umm Habiba (Allah be pleased with them) were talking with each other (and saying) that a woman came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned to him that her daughter had lost her husband, and her eyes were sore and she wanted to use collyrium, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: One among you used to throw dung at the end of a year, and now (this abstinence from adornment) is only for four months and ten days.
1486.04 | Zainab bint Abu Salama reported that when the news of the death of Abu Safyan came to Umm Habiba she sent for yellow (perfume) on the third day and rubbed it on her forearms and on her cheeks and said:I had in fact no need of it, but I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: It is not permissible for the women believing in Allah and the Hereafter to abstain from adornment beyond three days except (at the death of) husband (in which case she must abstain from adornment) for four months and ten days.
1490.01 | Safiyya bint Abu 'Ubaid reported on the authority of Hafsa or 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with thein) or from both of them that Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) said:It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafter (or believing in Allah and His Messenger) that she should observe mourning for the dead beyond three days except in case of her husband.
1490.02 | A hadith like this is transmitted on the authority of Nafi'.
1490.03 | Safiyya bint Abu 'Ubaid reported that she heard Hafsa daughter of Umar (Allah be pleased with them), (and) wife of Allah's Prophet (ﷺ), narrating a hadith like this from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), and she made this addition:" She should abstain from adorning herself (in case of the death of her husband) for four months and ten days."
1490.04 | Safiyya bint Abu 'Ubaid narrated this tradition of Allah's Prophet (ﷺ) on the authority of some wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ)
1491 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafter to observe mourning on the dead for more than three (days), except in case of her husband.
938.03 | Umm `Atiyya (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had said:A woman must not observe mourning for one who had died for more than three (days) except for four months and ten days in the case of her husband. And she must not wear a dyed garment except one of the types made of dyed yarn, or apply collyrium, or touch perfume except a little perfume or incense, when she has been purified after her courses.
938.04 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Hisham with the same chain of narrators but with a slight variation of words.
938.05 | Umm 'Atiyya ('Allah be pleased with her) said:We were forbidden to observe mourning for the dead beyond three days except in the case of husband (where it is permissible) for four months and ten days, and (that during this period) we should neither use collyrium nor touch perfume, nor wear dyed clothes, but concession was given to a woman when one of us was purified of our courses to make use of a little incense or scent.
1492.01 | Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idi reported that'Uwaimir al-'Ajlani came to 'Asim b. 'Adi al-Ansari and said to him. Tell me about a person who finds a man with his wife; should he kill him, and be killed In retaliation; or how should he act? 'Asim, ask for me (religious verdict about it) from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). So 'Asim asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he did not like this question and he disapproved of it so much that'Asim felt aggrieved at what he had heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When 'Asim came back to his family, 'Uwaimir came to him and said:'Asim, what did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say to you? 'Asim said to 'Uwaimir: You did not bring something good. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not like this religious verdict that I sought from him. 'Uwaimir said: By Allah, I will not rest until I have asked him about it. 'Uwaimir proceeded until he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as he was sitting amidst people, and said: Messenger of Allah, tell me about a person who found a man with his wife. Should he kill him, and then you would kill him, or how should he act? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: (Verses) have been revealed concerning you and your wife; so go and bring her. Sahl said that they both invoked curses (and further said): I was along with people in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). And when they had finished, Uwaimir said: Allah's Messenger, I shall have told a lie against her if I keep her (now). So he divorced her with three pronouncements before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had commanded him. Ibn Shihab said: Subsequently that was the practice of invokers of curses (al Mutala'inain)
1492.02 | Sahl b. Sa'd reported.. 'Uwaimir al-Ansari (Allah be pleased with him) from Banu'l-'Ajlan came to 'Asim b. 'Adi (Allah be pleased with him) the remaining part of the hadith is the same and it was also reecorded in it:" And subsequebtly the separation became the practice of al-Mutala'inain." And this addition was also made:" She was pregnant and her son was ascribed to her, and it became customary that such (a son) would inherit her and she would inherit him in the share prescribed by Allah for her.
1492.03 | Ibn Shihab narrated about the invokers of curses and the practice of (li'an) based on the authority of Sahl b. Sa'd, of the tribe of Sa'ida. that a person from the Ansar came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said:Allah's Messenger, tell me about the person who found a man with his wife. The remaining part of the hadith is the same (but) with this addition: They invoked curses in the mosque and I was present there. And he narrated in the hadith: He divorced her with three pronouncements before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded him (to get separation). He separated from her in the presence of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), whereupon he said: There is a separation between the invokers of curses.
1493.01 | Sa'id b Jubair reported:I was asked about the invokers of curses during the reign of Mus'ab (b. Zubair) whether they could separate (themselves by this process). He said: I did not understand what to say. So I went to the house of Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) in Mecca. I said to his servant: Seek permission for Me. He said that he (Ibn 'Umar) had been taking rest. He (Ibn 'Umar) heard my voice. and said: Are you Ibn Jubair? I said: Yes. He'said: Come in. By Allah, it must be some (great) need which has brought you here at this Hour. So I got in and found him lying on a blanket reclining against a pillow stuffed with fibres of date-palm. I said: O Abu'Abd al-Rahman, should there be separation between the invokers of curses? He said: Hallowed be Allah, yes, The first one who asked about it was so and so. he said: Messenger of Allah, tell me If one of us finds his wife committing adultery: what should he do? If he talks, that is something great, and if he keeps quiet that is also (something great) (which he cannot afford to do). Allah's Prophet (ﷺ) kept quiet (or some time). After some time he (that very person) came to him (Allah's Messenger) and said: I have been involved in that very cage about which I had asked you Allah the Exalted and Majestic then revealed (these) verses of Surah Nur:" Those who accuse their wives" (verse 6), and he (the Holy Prophet) recited them to him and admonished him, and exhorted him and informed him that the torment of the world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter. He said: No, by Him Who sent you with Truth, I did not tell a lie against her. He (the Holy Prophet) then called her (the wife of that person who had accused her) and admonished her, and exhorted her, and informed her that the torment of this world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter. She said: No, by Him Who sent thee with Truth, he is a liar. (it was) the man who started the swearing of oath and he swore in the name of Allah four times that he was among the truthful. and at the fifth turn he said: Let there be curse of Allah upon him if he were among the liars. Then the woman was called and she swore four times in the name of Allah that he (her husband) was among the liars, and at the fifth time (she said): Let there be curse upon her if he were among the truthful. He (the Holy Prophet) then effected separation between the two.
1493.02 | A hadith like this is narrated by Ibn Numair with a slight variation of words.
1493.03 | Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying to the invokers of curse:Your account is with Allah. One of you must be a liar. You have now no right over this woman. He said: Messenger of Allah, what about my wealth (dower that I paid her at the time of marriage)? He said: You have no claim to wealth. If you tell the truth, it (dower) is the recompense for your having had the right to intercourse with her, and if you tell a lie against her, it is still more remote from you than she is. Zuhair said in his narration: Sufyan reported to us on the authority of 'Amr that he had heard Sa'id b Jubair saying: I heard Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) saying that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had said it.
1493.04 | Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) effected separation between the two members of Banu al-'Ajlan, and said:Allah knows that one of you is a liar. Is there one to repent among you?
1493.05 | Sa'id b. Jubair reported:I asked Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) about invoking curse (li'an), and he narrated Similarly from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ).
1493.06 | Sa'id b. Jubair reported that Mus'ab b. Zubair did not effect separation between the Mutala'inain (invokers of curses). Sa'id said:It was mentioned to 'Abdullah b. Umar (Allah be pleased with them) and he said: Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) effected separation between the two members of Banu al-'Ajlan.
1494.01 | Nafi' reported on the authority of Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) that a person invoked curse on the wife during the lifetime of Allah s Messenger (ﷺ), so he effected separation between them and traced the lineage of the son to his mother.
1494.02 | Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked a person from the Anger and his wife to invoke curse (upon one another in order to testify to their truthfulness), and then effected separation between them.
1494.03 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of 'Ubaidulah with the same chain of transmitters.
1495.01 | 'Abdullah reported:We were on the night of Friday staying in the mosque when a person from the Ansar came there and said: If a person finds hiswoman along with a man, and he speaks about it, you would lash him, and if he kills, you will kill him, and if he keeps quiet he shall have to consume anger. By Allah, I will definitely ask about him from Allah's Mescenger (ﷺ). On the following day he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked him thus: If a man were to find with his wife a man and if he were to talk about it, you would lash him; and if he killed, you would kill him, and if he were to keep quiet. he would consume anger, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah, solve (this problem), and he began to supplicate (before Him), and then the verses pertaining to li'an were revealed:" Those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves" (xxiv. 6). The person was then put to test according to these verses in the presence of the people. There came he and his wife in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and they invoked curses (in order to testify their claim). The man swore four times in the name of Allah that he was one of the truthful and then invoked curse for the fifth time saying: Let there be curse of Allah upon him if he were among the liars. Then she began to invoke curse. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to her: just wait (and curse after considering over it), but she refused and invoked curse and when she turned away, he (Allah's Apostle) said: It seems that this woman shall give birth to a curly-haired black child, And so she did gave birth to a curly-haired black child.
1495.02 | A hadith like this is narrated on the authority of A'mash.
1496 | Muhammad (one of the narrators) reported:I asked Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) knowing that he had a knowledge of (the case of li'an). He said: Hilal b. Umayya (Allah be pleased with him) accused his wife with the charge of fornication with Sharik b. Sahma, the brother of al-Bara'b Malik from the side of his mother. And he was the first person who invoked curse (li'an) in Islam. He in fact invoked curse upon her. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: See to her if she gives birth to a white-complexioned child having dark hair and bright eyes; he must be the son of Hilal b. Umayya; and if she gives birth to a child with dark eyelids, curly hair and lean shanks, he must be the offspring of Sharik b. Sahma. He said: I was informed that she gave birth to a child having dark eyelids, curly hair and lean shanks.
1497.01 | Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported:Mention was made of li'an in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). And Asim b. 'Adi passed a remark about it and then turned away, and a man of his tribe came to him complaining that he had found a man with his wife, whereupon 'Asim said: I have been taken by my words. He took him to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and told him about the man whom he had found with his wife and this man was a lean, yellow-coloured man with lank hair, and the person who was accused of committing adultery with her (his wife) had fleshy shanks, with wheat complexion and heavy bulk. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: O Allah, make (this case) manifest. And as she gave birth to a child, whose face resembled that person about whom her husband had made mention that he had found her with, and Allah's Messenger (may peace be, upon him) had asked them to invoke curses. A person said to Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him): Is she (that woman) about whom Allah's Messenger (may peace be upen him) (said):" If I were to stone anybody without evidence, I would have stoned her"? Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) said: No, it is not she. That woman was one who openly spread evil in society.
1497.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) through another chain of transmitters with the addition of these words:'With flesh, and curly tangled hair."
1497.03 | 'Abdullah b Shaddad reported that mention was made about the invokers of curses before Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them). Ibn Shaddad said:Are these the two about whom Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said." If I were to stone one without evidence, I would have definitely stoned her"? Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) said: She is not this woman; but she is the one who (committed adultery) openly.
1498.01 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Sa'd b. 'Ubada al-Ansari said:Messenger of Allah, tell me if a man finds his wife with another person, should he kill him? Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: No. Sa'd said: Why not? I swear by Him Who has honored you with the Truth. There upon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Listen to what your chief says.
1498.02 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Sa'd b. Ubada (Allah be pleased with him) said:Messenger of Allah, if I were to find with my wife a man, should I wait until I bring four witnesses? He said: Yes.
1498.03 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Sa'd b. Ubada (Allah be pleased with him) said:Messenger of Allah, if I were to find with my wife a man, should I not touch him before bringing four witnesses? Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Yes. He said: By no means. By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I would hasten with my sword to him before that. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Listen to what your chief says. He is jealous of his honour, I am more jealous than he (is) and God is more jealous than I.
1499.01 | AI-Mughira b. Shu'ba (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Sa'd b. 'Ubada (Allah be pleased with him) said:If I were to see a man with my wife, I would have struck him with the sword, and not with the flat part (side) of it. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard of that, he said: Are you surprised at Sa'd's jealousy of his honour? By Allah, I am more jealous of my honour than he, and Allah is more jealous than I. Because of His jealousy Allah has prohibited abomination, both open and secret And no person is more jealous of his honour than Allah, and no persons, is more fond of accepting an excuse than Allah, on account of which He has sent messengers, announcers of glad tidings and warners; and no one is more fond of praise than Allah on account of which Allah has promised Paradise.
1499.02 | A hadith like this has been transmitted on the authority, of 'Abd al-Malik b. Umair with the same chain of narraters but with a slight change of words.
1500.01 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported:There came a person to the Prophet (may peace he upon him) ) from Banu Fazara and said: My wife has given birth to a child who is black, whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Have you any camels? He said: Yes. He again said: What is this colour? He said: They are red. He said: Is there a dusky one among them? He said: Yes, there are dusky ones among them He said: How has it come about? He said: It is perhaps the strain to which it has reverted, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: It is perhaps the strain to which he (the child) has reverted.
1500.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters. In the hadith transmitted on the authority of Ma'mar, the (words are):" Messenger of Allah, my wife has given birth to a dark-complexioned boy, and he at that time was intending to disown him." And this addition has been made at the end of the hadith:" He (the Holy Prophet) did not permit him to disown him."
1500.03 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported:A desert Arab came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: My wife has given birth to a dark-complexioned child and I have disowned him. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Have you any camels? He said: Yes. He said: What is their colour? He said? They are red. He said: Is there anyone dusky among them? He said: Yes. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: How has it come about? He said: Messenger of Allah, it is perhaps due to the strain to which it has reverted, whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said: It (the birth) of the black child may be due to the strain to which he (the child) might have reverted.
1500.04 | A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) through another chain of transmitters.
1501.01 | Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah's Messenger may peace be upon him) as saying:If anyone emancipates his share ina slave and has enough money to pay the full price for him, a fair price for the slave should be fixed, his partners given their shares, and the slave be thus emancipated, otherwise he is emancipated only to the extent of the first man's share.
1501.02 | This hadith has been reported on the authority of Ibn 'Umar through another chain of transmitters.
1502 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The slave who is jointly owned by two persons, and is emancipated by one of them, (this one) has liability (upon him to secure complete freedom for that slave).
1503.01 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased witli him) reported Allah's Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:If anyone emancipates a share in a slave, he is to be completely emancipated if he has money; but if he has none, the slave will be required to work to pay for his freedom, but must not be over-burhened.
1503.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sa'id b. Abu 'Aruba with the same chain of transmitters but with the addition:" If he (one of the joint owners emancipating the slave) has not (enough) money (to secure freedom for the other half) a fair price for the slave should be fixed, and he will be required to work to pay for his freedom, but must not be over-burdened.
1503.03 | A hadith like this is reported on the authority of the same chain of transmitters but with a slight change of words.
1504.01 | Ibn Umar reported that 'A'isha decided to buy a slave-girl and then set her free, but her masters said:We are prepared to sell her to you on the condition that her right of inheritance would vest with you. She (Hadrat A'isha) made a mention of that to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whereupon he said: This should not stand in your way. The right of inheritance vests in one who emancipates.
1504.02 | 'A'isha (Allah be pjeased with her) reported that Barira came to her in order to seek her help in securing freedom, but she had (so far) paid nothing out of that sum stipulated in the contract. 'A'isba said to her. Go to your family (who owns you), and if they like that I should pay the amount (of the contract) on your behalf (for purchasing your freedom), then I shall have the right in your inheritance. (If they accepted it) I am prepared (to make this payment). Barira made a mention of that to the (members of) her family, but they refused and said:If she (Hadrat 'A'isha) wants to do good to You for the sake of Allah, she may do it, but the right of inheritance will be ours. She (Hadrat 'A'isha) made a mention of that to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and he said to her: Buy her, and emancipate her, for the right of inheritance vests with one who emancipates (the slave). Allah's Messenger, may peace be upon him) then stood up and said: What has happened to the people that they lay down conditions which are not (found) in the Book of Allah? And he who laid down a condition not found in the Book of Allah, that is not valid. even if it is laid down hundred times. The condition laid down by Allah is the most weighty and the most valid.
1504.03 | 'A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), reported:Barira came to me and said: 'A'isha, I have entered into contract for securing freedom with my family (who owns me) for nine 'uqiyas (of silver), one 'uqiya every year The rest of the hadith is the same (but with this addition):" This (the problem of the right of inheritance) should not stand in your way. Buy her, and set her free. He said in a hadith: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up among men, extolled Allah, praised Him, and then said:" for......"
1504.04 | 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:Barira came to me and said: My family (owners) have made contract with me (for granting freedom) for nine 'uqiyas (of silver) payable in nine years, one 'uqiya every year. Help me (in making this payment). I said to her: If your family so desires, I am prepared to make them the full payment in one instalment, and thus secure freedom for you, but the right of inheritance will vest in me, if I do so. She (Barira) made a mention of that to her family, but they refused (except) on the condition that the right of inheritance would vest in them. She came to me and made mention of if She ('A'isha) said: I scolded her. She (Barira) said: By Allah, it is not possible (they will never agree to it). And as she was saying it, Allah's messenger (ﷺ) heard, and he asked me, I informed him and he said: Buy her and emancipate her, and let the right of inherit- ance vest in them, for they cannot claim it (rightfully) since the right of inherritance vests with one who emancipates (the slave; therefore, these people have no right to lay such false claims). And I did so. She ('A'isha) said: Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) delivered a sermon in the evening. He extolled Allah and praised Him with what He deserves, and then said afterwards,: What has happened to the people that they lay down conditions which are not found in the Book of Allah? And the condition which is not found in the Book of Allah is invalid, even if its number is one hundred. The Book of Allah is more true (than any other deed) and the condition laid down by Allah is more binding (than any other condition). What has happened to the people among you that someone among you says:" Emancipate so and so, but the right of inheritance vests in me"? Verily, the right of inheritance vests in one who emancipates.
1504.05 | Hisham b. 'Urwa narrated a hadith like this with the same chain of trans- mitters except (with this change) that in the hadith transmitted on the authority of jartr (the words are):Her (Barira's) husband was a slave, so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave her the option (either to retain her matrimonial relation with her husband or sever it off). She opted to break off (and secure freedom for her even from the matrimonial alliance). And if he were free he would not have given her the option. In the hadith narrated on the authority (of this chain of transmitters) these words are not found: Amma ba'du.
1504.06 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. al. Qasim reported on the authority of his father:'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: There were three issues which were clarified in case of Barira: her owners had decided to sell her on the condition that the right of her inheritance would vest with them. She ('A'isha) said: I made a mention of that to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he said: Buy her and emancipate her, for verily the right of inheritance vests with one who emancipates. She said that she emancipated (her) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave her the option (either to retain her matrimonial alliance or break it after emancipation). She (taking advantage of the option) opted for herself (the severing of matrimonial alliance). 'A'isha said: The people used to give her charity and she gave us that as gift. I made a mention of it to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), whereupon he said: That is charity for her but gift for you, so take that.

As for Mukhabara it is this that a wasteland is given by a person to another and he makes an investment in it and then gets a share in the produce.

Khadij (Allah be pleased with him) narratted (a hadith) in which (there was a decree) of prohibition by Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). He (Ibn 'Umar) went to him (Rafi b. Khadij) and I was with him and he asked him, whereupon he said:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to forbid the renting of land. So Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) abandoned it, and subsequently whenever he was asked about it, he said: Rafi b.

Khadij said to Abdullah: I heard it from two uncles of mine and they had participated in the Battle of Badr who narrated to the members of the family that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade the renting of land. Abdullah said: I knew it that the land was rented during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Abdullah then apprehended that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have said something new in this connection (in regard to prohibition of renting) which I failed to know.

(But it so happened) that at times this was destroyed and that was saved. whereas (on other occasions) this portion was saved and the other was destroyed and thus no rent was payable to the people (who let out lands) but for this one (which was saved). It was due to this that he (the Holy Prophet) prohibited it. But if there is something definite and reliable (e. g. money). there is no harm in it.
1547.13 | Hanzala reported that he heard Rafi' b. Khadij (Allah be pleased with him) say:We were the major agriculturists of the Ansar and so we let out land (saying): The produce of this (part of land) would be ours and (the produce) of that would be theirs. But it so happened that at times this (land) gave harvest, but the other one produced nothing. So he (the Holy Prophet) forbade this.

But it has been narrated to me by one who has better knowledge of it amongst them (and he meant Ibn 'Abbas) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: It is better if a person lends, his land to his brother (for cultivation) than that he gets recognised rent on it.
1550.02 | Tawus reported that he let out his land on rent, whereupon Amr said:I said to him: Abu Abd al-Rahrman, I wish if you abandon this renting of land, for they alleged that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) forbade Mukhabara. He siad: Amr, one who has informed me has the best knowledge of it among them (he meant Ibn Abbas).

Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) contracted with the people of Khaibar (land and trees on the condition that they should give) half of the yield from land and trees.

The jews asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to let them continue there on the condition that they would work on it, and would get in turn half of the fruit (of the trees), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:We would let you continue there so long as we will desire.

Go back and return that, and do not accept but weight, for weight, for I used to hear from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying: Wheat for wheat and like for like. He (one of the narrators) said: Our food in those days consisted of barley. It was said to him (Ma'mar) that (wheat) is not like that (barley). He replied: I am afraid these may not be similar
1593.01 | Abu Huraira and Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) deputed a person from Banu 'Adi al-Ansari to collect revenue from Khaibar. He came with a fine quality of dates, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him:Are all the dates of Khaibar like this? He said: Allah's Messenger, it is not so. We buy one sa' of (fine quality of dates) for two sa's out of total output (including even the inferior quality of dates), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Don't do that, but like for like, or sell this (the inferior quality and receive the price) and then buy with the price of that, and that would make up the measure.
1593.02 | Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) deputed a person to collect revenue from Khaibar. He brought fine quality of dates, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Are all the dates of Khaibar like this)? He said: No. We got one sa' (of fine dates) for two sa's (of inferior dates), and (similarly) two sa's for three sa's. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Don't do that rather sell the inferior quality of dates for dirhams (money), and then buy the superior quality with the help of dirhams.
1594.01 | Abd Sa'id reported:Bilal (Allah be pleased with him) came with fine quality of dates. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: From where (you have brought them)? Bilal said: We had inferior quality of dates and I exchanged two sa's (of inferior quality) with one sa (of fine quality) as food for Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Woe! it is in fact usury; therefore, don't do that. But when you intend to buy dates (of superior quality), sell (the inferior quality) in a separate bargain and then buy (the superior quality). And in the hadith transmitted by Ibn Sahl there is no mention of" whereupon".
1594.02 | Abu Sa'id (Allah be pleased with him) reported:Dates were brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and he said: These dates are not like our dates, whereupon a man said: We sold two sa's of our dates (in order to get) one sa', of these (fine dates), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: That is interest; so return (these dates of fine quality), and get your (inferior dates) ; then sell our dates (for money) and buy for us (with the help of money) such (fine dates).
1595 | Abu Sa'id (Allah be pleased with him) reported:We were given to eat, during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), dates of different qualities mixed together, and we used to sell two sa's of these for one sa, (of fine quality of dates). This reached Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whereupon he said: There should be no exchange of two sa's of (inferior) dates for one sa (of fine dates) and two sa's of (inferior) wheat for one sa' of (fine) wheat. and one dirham for two dirharms.
1594.03 | Abu Nadra reported:I asked Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) about the conversion (of gold and silver for silver and gold). We said: Is it hand to hand exchange? I said: Yes. whereupon he said: There is no harm in it. I informed Abu Sa'id about it, telling him that I had asked Ibn 'Abbas about it and he said: Is it hand to hand exchange? I said: Yes, whereupon he said: There is no harm in it. He (the narrator) said, or he said like it: We will soon write to him, and he will not give you this fatwa (religious verdict). He said: By Allah, someone of the boy-servants of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) brought dates, but he refused to accept them (on the plea) that those did not seem to be of the dates of our land. He said: Something had happened to the dates of our land, or our dates. So I got these dates (in exchange by giving) excess (of the dates of our land), whereupon he said: You made an addition for getting the fine dates (in exchange) which tantamounts, to interest; don't do that (in future). Whenever you find some doubt (as regards the deteriorating quality of) your dates, sell them, and then buy the dates that you like.
1594.04 | Abu Nadra reported:I asked Ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) about the conversion of gold with gold but they did not find any harm in that. I was sitting in the company of Abd Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) and asked him about this exchange, and he said: Whatever is addition is an' interest. I refused to accept it on account of their statement (statement of Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn 'Umar). He said: I am not narrating to you except what I heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). There came to him the owner of a date-palm with one sa' of fine dates, and the dates of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) were of that colour. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said to him: Where did you get these dates? I went with two sa's of (inferior dates) and bought one sa' of (these fine dates), for that is the prevailing price (of inferior dates) in the market and that is the price (of the fine quality of dates in the market), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Woe be upon you! You have dealt in interest, when you decide to do it (i. e. exchange superior quality of dates for inferior quality) ; so you should sell your dates for another commodity (or currency) and then with the help of that commodity buy the dates you like. Abu Sa'ad said: When dates are exchanged for dates (with different qualities) there is the possibility (of the element of) interest (creeping into that) or when gold is exchanged for gold having different qualities. I subsequently came to Ibn 'Umar and he forbade me (to do it), but I did not come to Ibn 'Abbas; (Allah be pleased with them). He (the narrator) said: Abu as-Sahba' narrated to me: He asked Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) in Mecca, and he too disapproved of it.
1596.01 | Abu Salih reported:I heard Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) said: Dinar (gold) for gold and dirham for dirham can be (exchanged) with equal for equal; but he who gives more or demands more in fact deals in interest. I sald to him: Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) says otherwise, whereupon he said: I met Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) and said: Do you see what you say; have you heard it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), or found it in the Book of Allah, the Glorious and Majestic? He said: I did not hear it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). and I did not find it in the Book of Allah (Glorious and Majestic), but Usama b. Zaid narrated it to me that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: There can be an element of interest in credit.
1596.02 | Ubaidullah b. Abu Yazid heard Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) as saying:Usama b. Zaid reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying: There can be an element of interest in credit (when the payment is not equal).
1596.03 | Ibn 'Abbas; (Allah be pleased with them) reported on the authority of Usama b. Zaid Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as having said this:There is no element of interest when the money or commodity is exchanged hand to hand.
1596.04 | Ata' b. Abu Rabah reported:Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with them) met Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) and said to him: What do you say in regard to the conversion (of commodities or money) did you hear it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), or is it something which you found In Allah's Book, Majestic and Glorious? Thereupon Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleated with them) said: I don't say that. So far at Allah's Massenger (ﷺ) is concerned, you know him better, and to far as the Book of Allah to concerned, I do not know it (more than you do), but 'Usama b. Zaid (Allah be pleased with him) narrated to me Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as having said this: Beware, there can be an element of interest in credit.
1597 | 'Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) (Allah be pleased with him) said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) cursed the one who accepted interest and the one who paid it I asked about the one who recorded it, and two witnesses to it. He (the narrator) said:We narrate what we have heard.
1598 | Jabir said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) cursed the accepter of interest and its payer, and one who records it, and the two witnesses, and he said:They are all equal.
1599.01 | Nu'man b. Bashir (Allah be pleased with him) reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon himn) as having said this (and Nu'man) pointed towards his ears with his fingers): What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them are the things doubtful which many people do not know. So he who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and honour blameless, and he who indulges in doubtful things indulges in fact in unlawful things, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it. Beware, every king has a preserve, and the things God his declaced unlawful are His preserves. Beware, in the body there is a piece of flesh; if it is sound, the whole body is sound and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt, and hearken it is the heart.
1599.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zakariya with the same chain of transmitters.
1599.03 | AI-Nu'man b. Bashir reported it from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). The hadith narrated by Zakariya is, however, more complete and lengthy than the other ones.
1599.04 | Nu'man b. Bashir b. Sa'd, a Companion of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was heard delivering a sermon at Hims and was saying:I heard Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying: The lawful is evident and the unlawful is evident, the rest of the hadith is the same as related by Zakariya.
715.13 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he was travelling on his camel which had grown jaded, and he decided to let it off. When Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) met him and prayed for him and struck it, so it trotted as it had never trotted before. He said:Sell it to me for an 'uqaya. I said: No. He again said: Sell it to me. So I sold it to him for an 'uqaya, but made the stipulation that I should be allowed to ride back to my family. Then when I came to (my place) I took the camel to him and he paid me its price in ready money. I then went back and he sent: (someone) behind me (and as I came) he said: Do you see that I asked you to reduce price for buying your camel. Take your camel and your coins; these are yours.

715.15 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:I went on an expedition with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He overtook me and I was on a water-carrying camel who had grown tired and did not walk (trot). He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: What is the matter with your camel? I said: It is sick. He (the Holy Prophet) stepped behind and drove it and prayed for it, and then it always moved ahead of other camels. He (then) said: How do you find your camel? I said: It is, by the grace of your prayer, all right. He said: Would you sell this (camel) to me? I felt shy (to say him," No" ) as we had no other camel for carrying water, but (later on) I said: Yes, and to I sold it to him on the condition that (I would be permitted) to ride it until I reached Madina. I said to him: Allah's Messenger, I am newly married, so I asked his permission (to go ahead of the caravan). He permitted me, and I reached Medina well in advance of other people, until I reached my destination. There my maternal uncle met me and asked me about the camel, and I told him what I had done with regard to it. He reproved me in this connection. He (Jabir) said: When I asked his permission (to go ahead of the caravan) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) inquired of me whether I had married a virgin or a non-virgin. I said to him: I have married a non-virgin. He said: Why did you not marry a virgin who would have played with you and you would have played with her? I said to him: Allah's Messenger, my father died (or he fell as a martyr), and I have small sisters to (look after), so I did not like the idea that I should marry a woman who is like them and thus be not able to teach them manners and look after them properly. So I have married a non-virgin so that she should be able to look after them and teach them manners, When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to Medina, I went to him in the morning with the camel. He paid me its price and returned that (the camel) to me.
715.16 | Jabir reported:We went from Mecca to Medina with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when my camel fell ill, and the rest of the hadith is the same. (But it in also narrated in it: ) He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Sell your camel to me. I said: No, but it is yours. He said: No. (it can't be), but sell it to me. I said: No, but, Allah's Messenger, it is yours. He said: No, it can't be, but sell it to me. I said: Then give me an 'uqaya of gold for I owe that to a person and then it would be yours. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I take it (for an 'uqiya of gold) and you reach Medina on it. As I reached Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Bilal: Give him an 'uqiya of gold and make some extra payment too. He (Jabir) said: He gave me an 'uqiya of gold and made an addition of a qirat. He (Jabir) said: The addition made by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was with me (as a sacred trust for belssing) and lay with me in a pocket until the people of Syria took it on the Day of Harra.
715.17 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:We were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in a journey and my camel meant for carrying water lagged behind.

He constantly made addition (in prayers for me) and went on saying. May Allah forgive you!
715.18 | Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported:My camel had grown tired as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me. He goaded it and it began to jump. After that I tried to restrain its rein so that I could listen to his (Prophet's) words, but I could not do that. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) met me and said: Sell it to me, and I sold it for five 'uqiyas. I said: On the condition that I may use it as a ride (for going back) to Medina. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Well, you may use it as a ride up till Medina. When I came to Medina I handed over that to him and he made an addition of an uqiya (to that amount which had been agreed upon) and then presented that (camel) to me.

'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) who said:I accompanied Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in one of his journeys (the narrator says, he said in Jihad), and he narrated the rest of the hadith, and made this addition: He (the Holy Prophet) said: Jabir, have you received the price? I said: Yes, whereupon he said: Yours is the price as well as the camel; yours is the price as well as the camel.

'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported this narration from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) but with this variation that he said:He (the Holy Prophet) bought the camel from me on a stipulated price.

He ordered Abu Rafi' to return to that person the young camel (as a return of the loan). Abu Rafi' returned to him and said:I did not find among them but better camels above the age of six.

They said: We do not find a camel (of that age) but one with better age than that. He said: Buy that and give that to him, for best of you or best amongst you are those who are best in paying off debt.

1623.10 | Nu'man b. Bashir reported:My father conferred a gift upon me, and then brought me to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to make him a witness (to it).

1625.04 | Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said:The Umra for which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave sanction that a person way say: This (property) is for you and for your descendants.

1625.05 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded that whoever is conferred upon a life grant along with his descendants is entitled to make use of the property conferred so long as he lives and his successors (also enjoy this privilege).

1625.11 | Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported that a woman gave her garden as a life grant to her son. He died and later on she also died and left a son behind and brothers also, The sons of the woman making life grant said (to those who had been conferred upon this 'Umra):This garden has returned to us. The sons of the one who had been given life grant said: This belonged to our father, during his lifetime and in case of his death. They took their dispute to Tariq, the freed slave of 'Uthman. He called Jabir and he gave testimony of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said: Life grant belongs to one who is conferred upon this (privilege). Tariq gave this decision and then wrote to Abd al-Malik and informed him, Jabir bearing witness to it. Abd al-Malik said: Jabir has told the truth. Then Tariq gave a decree and, as a result thereof, it is to this day that the garden belongs to descendants of one who was conferred upon the life grant.
1625.12 | Sulaiman b. Yasir reported that Jabir gave this verdict. The inheritor has a right (to inherit) the life grant according to the statement of Jabir (b. 'Abdullah) (Allah be pleased with him) which he narrated from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).

I said: Allah's Messenger, you can well see the pain with which I am afflicted and I am a man possessing wealth, and there is none to inherit me except only one daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property as Sadaqa? He said: No. I said: Should I give half (of my property) as Sadaqa? He said: No. He (further) said: Give one-third (in charity) and that is quite enough. To leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor, begging from people; that you would never incur an expense seeking therewith the pleasure of Allah, but you would be rewarded therefor, even for a morsel of food that you put in the mouth of your wife. I said: Allah's Messenger. would I survive my companions? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If you survive them, then do such a deed by means of which you seek the pleasure of Allah, but you would increase in your status (in religion) and prestige; you may survive so that people would benefit from you, and others would be harmed by you. (The Holy Prophet) further said: Allah, complete for my Companions their migration, and not cause them to turn back upon their heels. Sa'd b. Khaula is, however, unfortunate.

Khaula except this that he said:" He (the Holy Prophet) did not like death in the land from which lie had migrated."
1628.04 | Mus'ab b. Sa'd reported on the authority of his father. I was ailing. I sent message to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) saying:Permit me to give away my property as I like. He refused. I (again) said: (Permit me) to give away half. He (again refused). I (again said): Then one-third. He (the Holy Prophet) observed silence after (I had asked permission to give away) one-third. He (the narrater) said: It was then that endowment of one-third became permissible.

He (Sa'd) wept. He (the Holy Prophet) said:What makes you weep? He said: I am afraid I may die in the land from where I migrated as Sa'd b. Khaula had died. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: O Allah, grant health to Sa'd. O Allah, grant health to Sad. He repeated it three times. He (Sa'd) said: Allah's Messenger, I own a large property and I have only one daughter as my inheritor. Should I not will away the whole of my property? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No. He said: (Should I not will away, ) two-thirds of the property? he (the Holy Prophet) said: No. He (Sa'd) (again) said: (Should I not will away) half (of my property)? He said: No. He (Sa'd) said: Then one-third? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yes), one-third, and one-third is quite substanial. And what you spend as charity from your property is Sadaqa and flour spending on your family is also Sadaqa, and what your wife eats from your property is also Sadaqa, and that you leave your heirs well off (or he said: prospreous) is better than to leave them (poor and) begging from people.

So 'Umar gave it as Sadaqa declaring that property must not be sold or inherited or given away as gift. And Umar devoted it to the poor, to the nearest kin, and to the emancipation of slaves, aired in the way of Allah and guests. There is no sin for one, who administers it if he eats something from it in a reasonable manner, or if he feeds his friends and does not hoard up goods (for himself). He (the narrator) said: I narrated this hadith to Muhammad, but as I reached the (words)" without hoarding (for himself) out of it." he (Muhammad' said:" without storing the property with a view to becoming rich."

Try to learn from him (this point). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Leave me. I am better in the state (than the one in which you are engaged). I make a will about three things: Turn out the polytheists from the territory of Arabia; show hospitality to the (foreign) delegations as I used to show them hospitality.

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to him and he was tied with ropes. He said:Muhammad. He came near him and said: What is the matter with you? Thereupon he (the prisoner) said: Why have you taken me as prisoner and why have you caught hold of one proceeding the pilgrims (the she-camel as she carried the Prophet on her back and walked ahead of the multitude)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yours is a great fault). I (my men) have caught hold of you for the crime of your allies, Banu Thaqif. He (the Holy Prophet) then turned away. He again called him and said: Muhammad, Muhammad, and since Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was very compassionate, and tenderhearted, he returned to him, and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am a Muslim, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Had you said this when you had been the master of yourself, you would have gained every success. He then turned away. He (the prisoner) called him again saying: Muhammad, Muhammad. He came to him and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am hungry, feed me, and I am thirsty, so provide me with drink. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That is (to satisfy) your want. He was then ransomed for two persons (who had been taken prisoner by Thaqif).

They (some of the Prophet's Companions) came and informed him about this (rankling of theirs), whereupon he said: It was not I who provided you with a mount, but Allah has provided you with that. So far as I am concerned, by Allah, if He so wills, I would not swear, but if, later on, I would see better than it, I (would break the vow) and expiate it and do that which is better.

So ride upon them.

They said to me: By Allah, in our opinion you are certainly truthful, and we would do as you like. So Abu Musa went along withsome of the menfrom them until they came to those who had heard the words of Allah's Messenger (may, peace be upon him) and his refusal to (provide) them with (animals) ; and subsequently his granting (the animals) to them; and they narrated to them exactly as Abu Masa had narrated to them.

He (Abu Masa) said: Come on, for I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) eating it (fowl's meat), whereupon that person said: I saw it eating something (of filth and rubbish) and I found it repugnant and took an oath that I would never eat that.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with riding animals. And there is nothing with me with which I can provide you a mount. We stayed (for some time) there as Allah willed, and there was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) booty of camels. He called us and commanded that we should be given five white humped camels. As we were about to go back, some of us said to the other: As we made Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forget oath, there would be no blessing for us (in his gift). We went back to him and said: Allah's Messenger, we came to you to provide us with riding animals and you took an oath that you would never equip us with mounts and then you have provided us with the riding beasts Allah's Messenger, have you forgotten? Thereupon he said: I swear by Allah that if Allah so wills, I shall not swear an oath, and then consider something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing the thing that is better. So you go; Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has given you riding animals.

You will soon meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds. So do not turn after me unbelievers (or misguided), some of you striking the necks of the others. Behold I let him who is present convey to him who is absent, for many a one whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than one who hears. He again said: Behold! have I not delivered (the message) to you? This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of words.
1679.02 | Abu Bakra reported that when it was that day (the 10th of Dhu'l-Hijja) he mounted his camel and a person caught its nosestring, whereupon he said:Do you know which day is this? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. (The Prophet [may peace be upon him] kept silent) until we thought that he would give that another name. He said: Is it not the day of Nahr (Sacrifice) (10th of Dhu'l- Hijja)? We said: Allah's Messenger, yes. He (again) said: Which month is it? We said: Allah and His Messenger knows best. He said: Is it not Dhu'l-Hijja? We said: Allah's Messenger, yes. He said: Which city is this? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He (the narrator) said (that the Prophet kept silent until we thought that he would give it another name besides its (original) name. He said: Is it not Balda (the city of Mecca)? We said: Yes, Allah's Messenger. He (then) said: Verily your blood (lives) and your property and your honour are as sacred unto you as sacred is this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this city of yours. Let him who is present convey it to one who is absent. He then turned his attention towards two multicoloured (black and white) rams and slaughtered them, and two goats, and distributed them amongst us.
1679.03 | Abu Bakra reported that when it was the day of (Dhu'l-Hijja) Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) mounted the camel and addressed and a person had been holding its nosestring. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1679.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Bakra through another chain of transmitters (and the words are):" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) addressed us on the day of Nahr (Sacrifice) and said: What day is this? And the rest of the hadith is the same except that he did not make mention of" your honour," and also did not make mention of this: He then turned his attention towards two rams and what follows, and in a hadith (the words pertaining to sacred- ness are recorded in this way):" Like the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this city of yours to the day when you will meet your Lord. Behold, have I not conveyed (the Message of God)? They said: Yes. He said: O Allah, bear witness."
1680.01 | 'Alqama b. Wa'il reported on the authority of his-father:While I was sitting in the company of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), a person came there dragging another one with the help of a strap and said: Allah's Messenger, this man has killed my brother. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: Did you kill him? And the other man said: (In case he did not make a confession of this, I shall brine, a witness against him). He (the murderer) said: Yes, I have killed him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Why did you kill him? He said: I and he won striking down the leaves of a tree and he abused me and enraged me, and to I struck his head with an axe and killed him, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Have you anything with you to pay blood-wit on your behalf? He said: I do not possess any property but this robe of mine and this axe of mine. He (the Holy, Prophet) said: Do you think your people will pay ransom for you? He said: I am more insignificant among my people than this (that I would not be able to get this benefit from my tribe). He (the Holy Prophet) threw the strap towards him (the claimant of the blood-wit) saying: Take away your man. The man took him away, and as he returned, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: If he kills him, he will be like him. He returned and said: Allah's Messenger, it has reached me that you have said that" If he killed him, he would be like him." I caught hold of him according to your command, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Don't you like that he should take upon him (the burden) of your sin and the sin of your companion (your brother)? He said: Allah's Apostle, why not? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be. upon him) said: If it is so, then let it be. He threw away the strap (around the offender) and set him free.
1680.02 | 'Alaqama b. Wa'il reported on the authority of his father that a person was brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who had killed another person, and the heir of the person slain had dragged him (to the Holy Prophet) with a strap around his neck. As he turned away Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:The killer and the killed are (doomed) to fire. A person came to the other person (the heir of the deceased) and he reported to him the words of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and so he let him off. Isma'il b. Salim said: I made a mention of it to Habib b. Abu Thabit and he said: Ibn Ashwa' reported to me that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had asked him to pardon him, but he refused.
1681.01 | Abu Huraira reported that among two women of the tribe of Hudhail one flung a stone upon the other causing an abortion to her so Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) gave judgment that a male or a female slave of best quality be given as compensation.
1681.02 | Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave judgment in case of the abortion of a woman of Banu Lihyan (that the offender and near relative should give compensation in the form of) good quality of a slave or a slave-girl.

1681.03 | Abu Huraira reported that two women of the tribe of Hudhail fought with each other and one of them flung a stone at the other, killing her and what was in her womb. The case was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he gave judgment that the diyat (indemnity) of her unborn child is a male or a female slave of the best quality, and he also decided that the diyat of the woman is to be paid by her relative on the father's side, and he (the Holy Prophet) made her sons and those who were with them her heirs. Hamal b. al-Nabigha al-Hudhali said:Messenger of Allah, why should I play blood-wit for one who neither drank, nor ate, nor spoke, nor made any noise; it is like a nonentity (it is, therefore, not justifiable to demand blood-wit for it). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He seems to be one of the brothers of soothsavers on account of the rhymed speech which he has composed.
1681.04 | Abu Huraira reported that two women fought-the rest of the hadith is the same but herein no mention has been made of:He made her son and those who were with them her heirs. Someone said: Why should we pay blood-wit? And he did not name Hamal b. Malik.
1682.01 | Al-Mughira b. Shu'ba reported that a woman struck her co-wife with a tent-pole and she was pregnant and she killed her. One of them belonged to the tribe of Lihyan. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made the relatives of the murderer responsible for the payment of blood-wit on her behalf, and fixed a slave or a female slave as the indemnity for what was in her womb. One of the persons amongst the relatives of the murderer said:Should we pay indemnity for one who, neither ate, nor drank, nor made any noise, who was just like a nonentity? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) remarked: He speaks rhymed phrases like the people of the desert. He did impose indemnity upon them.
1682.02 | Al-Mughira b. Shu'ba reported:A woman killed her fellow-wife with a tent-pole. Her case was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and he gave judgment that blood-wit should be paid by the relatives (of the offender) on the father's side. And as she was pregnant, he decided regarding her unborn child that a male or a female slave of good quality be given. Some of her offender's) relatives said: Should we make compensation for one who never ate, nor drank, nor made any noise, who was like a nonentity? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He was talking rhymed phrases like the rhymed phrases of desert Arabs.
1682.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Mansur with the same chain of transmitters.
1682.04 | Mansur transmitted this hadith with a slight variation of words.
1683 | Miswar b. Makhrama reported that 'Umar b. Khattab consulted people about the diyat of abortion of an unboam child. Mughira b. Shu'ba said:I bear witness to the fact that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave judgment about it that a good quality of slave or female slave should be given for it. Thereupon 'Umar said: Bring one who may bear witness to you. Then Muhammad b. Maslama bore witness to him.

1685.01 | 'A'isha reported that during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the hand of the thief was not cut off for less than the price of a shield, iron coat or armour and both of them are valuable.
1685.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Hisham through another chain of transmitters, and in the hadith narrated by 'Abd al-Rahim and Abu Usama (the words are):" That (the shield) was valuable those days."
1686.01 | Ibn 'Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace upon him) cut off the hand of a thief (in case of the theft) of a shield the price of which was three dirhams.
1686.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Umar through some other chains of transmitters but with a slight variation of words.
1687.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Let there be the curse of Allah upon the thief who steals an egg and his hand is cut off, and steals a rope and his hand is cut off.

1688.01 | 'A'isha reported that the Quraish had been anxious about the Makhzumi woman who had committed theft, and said:Who will speak to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about her? They said: Who dare it, but Usama, the loved one of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? So Usama spoke to him. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Do you intercede regarding one of the punishments prescribed by Allah? He then stood up and addressed (people) saying: O people, those who have gone before you were destroyed, because if any one of high rank committed theft amongst them, they spared him; and it anyone of low rank committed theft, they inflicted the prescribed punishment upon him. By Allah, if Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, were to steal, I would have her hand cut off. In the hadith transmitted on the authority of Ibn Rumh (the words are):" Verily those before you perished."
1688.02 | `A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), reported that the Quraish were concerned about the woman who had committed theft during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), in the expedition of Victory (of Mecca). They said:Who would speak to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about her? They (again) said: Who can dare do this but Usama b. Zaid, the loved one of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? She was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Usama b. Zaid spoke about her to him (interceded on her behalf). The color of the face of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) changed, and he said: Do you intercede in one of the prescribed punishments of Allah? He (Usama) said: 'Messenger of Allah, seek forgiveness for me.' When it was dusk. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up and gave an address. He (first) glorified Allah as He deserves, and then said: Now to our topic. This (injustice) destroyed those before you that when any one of (high) rank committed theft among them, they spared him, and when any weak one among them committed theft, they inflicted the prescribed punishment upon him. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, even if Fatima daughter of Muhammad were to commit theft, I would have cut off her hand. He (the Holy Prophet) then commanded about that woman who had committed theft, and her hand was cut off. `A'isha (further) said: Hers was a good repentance, and she later on married and used to come to me after that, and I conveyed her needs (and problems) to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
1688.03 | 'A'isha reported that a woman from the tribe of Makhzum used to borrow things (from people) and then denied (having taken them). Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) commanded her hand to be cut off. Her relatives came to Usama b. Zaid and spoke to him (requesting him to intercede on her behalf). He spoke to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about her. The rest of the hadith is the same.
1689 | Jaibir reported that a woman from the tribe of Makhzum committed theft. She was brought to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and she sought refuge (intercession) from Umm Salama, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said:By Allah, even if she were Fatima, I would have her hand cut off. And thus her hand was cut off.
1690.01 | 'Ubada b. as-Samit reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has ordained a way for those (women). When an unmarried male commits adultery with an unmarried female (they should receive) one hundred lashes and banishment for one year. And in case of married male committing adultery with a married female, they shall receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death.
1690.02 | The above hadith is likewise narrated through another chain of transmitters.
1690.03 | 'Ubada b. as-Samit reported that whenever Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) received revelation, he felt its rigour and the complexion of his face changed. One day revelation descended upon him, he felt the same rigour. When it was over and he felt relief, he said:Take from me. Verily Allah has ordained a way for them (the women who commit fornication),: (When) a married man (commits adultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried male with an unmarried woman, then in case of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to death). And in case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile for one year.
1690.04 | This hadith has been reported on the authority of Qatada with the same chain of transmitters except with this variation that the unmarried is to be lashed and exiled, and the married one is to be lashed and stoned. There is neither any mention of one year nor that of one hundred.
1691.01 | 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas reported that 'Umar b. Khattab sat on the pulpit of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:Verily Allah sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with truth and He sent down the Book upon him, and the verse of stoning was included in what was sent down to him. We recited it, retained it in our memory and understood it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) awarded the punishment of stoning to death (to the married adulterer and adulteress) and, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in Allah's Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or it there is pregnancy, or a confession.
1691.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.
1691.03 | Abu Huraira reported that a person from amongst the Muslims came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while he was in the mosque. He called him saying:Allah's Messenger. I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away from him, He (again) came round facing him and said to him: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away until he did that four times, and as he testified four times against his own self, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called him and said: Are you mad? He said: No. He (again) said: Are you married? He said: Yes. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Take him and stone him.
1691.04 | Ibn Shihab (one of the narrators) said:One who had heard Jabir b. 'Abdullah saying this informed me thus: I was one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the place of prayer (either that of 'Id or a funeral). When the stones hurt him, he ran away. We caught him in the Harra and stoned him (to death).
1691.05 | This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters.
1691.06 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira through other chains of transmitters.
1692.01 | Jabir b. Samura reported:As he was being brought to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) I saw Ma'iz b. Malik-a short-statured person with strong sinews, having no cloak around him. He bore witness against his own self four times that he had committed adultery, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Perhaps (you kissed her or embraced her). He said: No. by God, one deviating (from the path of virtue) has committed adultery. He then got him stoned (to death), and then delivered the address: Behold, as we set out for Jihad in the cause of Allah, one of you lagged behind and shrieked like the bleating of a male goat, and gave a small quantity of milk. By Allah, in case I get hold of him, I shall certainly punish him.
1692.02 | Jabir b. Samura reported that there was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) a short-statured person with thick uncombed hair, muscular body, having a mantle around him and he had committed adultery. He turned him away twice and then made pronouncement about him and he was stoned. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:We set out for Jihad in the cause of Allah and one of you lagged behind and shrieked like the bleating of a male goat and one of then (goats' gave a small quantity of milk. In case Allah gives me power over one of them, I will punish him (in such a way that it may have a deterrent effect upon others). In another narration transmitted on the authority of Sa'id b Jubair (the words are), that He (the Holy Prophet) turned him away four times."
1692.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jabir b. Samura through another chain of transmitters with the difference that along with the mentioning (of the fact) that he (the Holy Prophet) turned him away twice, or thrice.
1693 | Ibn Abbas reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said to Ma'iz b. Malik:Is it true what has reached me about you? He said: What has reached you about me? He said: It has reached me that you have committed (adultery) with the slave-girl of so and so? He said: Yes. He (the narrator) said: He testified four times. He (the Holy Prophet) then made pronouncement about him and he was stoned (to death).
1694.01 | Abu Sa'id reported that a person belonging to the clan of Aslam, who was called Ma, iz b. Malik, came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:I have committed immorality (adultery), so inflict punishment upon me. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) turned him away again and again. He then asked his people (about the state of his mind). They said: We do not know of any ailment of his except that he has committed something about which he thinks that he would not be able to relieve himself of its burden but with the Hadd being imposed upon him. He (Ma'iz) came back to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he commanded us to stone him. We took him to the Baqi' al-Gharqad (the graveyard of Medina). We neither tied him nor dug any ditch for him. We attacked him with bones, with clods and pebbles. He ran away and we ran after him until he came upon the ston ground (al-Harra) and stopped there and we stoned him with heavy stones of the Harra until he became motionless (lie died). He (the Holy Prophet) then addressed (us) in the evening saying Whenever we set forth on an expedition in the cause of Allah, some one of those connected with us shrieked (under the pressure of sexual lust) as the bleating of a male goat. It is essential that if a person having committed such a deed is brought to me, I should punish him. He neither begged forgiveness for him nor cursed him.
1694.02 | Dawud narrated the hadith with the same chain of transmitters (and the words are):Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) stood tip (to address the audience) in the evening and praised Allah, glorified Him and then said: What about the people, that as we set out on an expedition, one of you remained behind us and he shrieked like the bleating of a male goat? But he did not mention (these words): People connected with us."
1694.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Dawud with the same chain of transmitters but with this variation that in the hadith narrated by Sufyan (the words are):" He made a confession of having committed adultery, thrice."
1695.01 | Sulaiman b. Buraida reported on the authority of his father that Ma, iz b. Malik came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said to him:Messenger of Allah, purify me, whereupon he said: Woe be upon you, go back, ask forgiveness of Allah and turn to Him in repentance. He (the narrator) said that he went back not far, then came and said: Allah's Messenger, purify me. whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Woe be upon you, go back and ask forgiveness of Allah and turn to Him in repentance. He (the narrator) said that he went back not far, when he came and said: Allah's Messenger, purify me. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said as he had said before. When it was the fourth time, Allah's Messenger (may, peace be upon him) said: From what am I to purify you? He said: From adultery, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked if he had been mad. He was informed that he was not mad. He said: Has he drunk wine? A person stood up and smelt his breath but noticed no smell of wine. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Have you committed adultery? He said: Yes. He made pronouncement about him and he was stoned to death. The people had been (divided) into two groups about him (Ma'iz). One of them said: He has been undone for his sins had encompassed him, whereas another said: There is no repentance more excellent than the repentance of Ma'iz, for he came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and placing his hand in his (in the Holy Prophet's) hand said: Kill me with stones. (This controversy about Ma'iz) remained for two or three days. Then came Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to them (his Companions) as they were sitting. He greeted them with salutation and then sat down and said: Ask forgiveness for Ma'iz b. Malik. They said: May Allah forgive Ma'iz b. Malik. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He (Ma'iz) has made such a repentance that if that were to be divided among a people, it would have been enough for all of them. He (the narrator) said: Then a woman of Ghamid, a branch of Azd, came to him and said: Messenger of of Allah, purify me, whereupon he said: Woe be upon you; go back and beg forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance. She said: I find that you intend to send me back as you sent back Ma'iz. b. Malik. He (the Holy, Prophet) said: What has happened to you? She said that she had become pregnant as a result of fornication. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is it you (who has done that)? She said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) said to her: (You will not be punished) until you deliver what is there in your womb. One of the Ansar became responsible for her until she was delivered (of the child). He (that Ansari) came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said the woman of Ghamid has given birth to a child. He (the Holy Prophet) said: In that case we shall not stone her and so leave her infant with none to suckle him. One of the Ansar got up and said: Allah's Apostle, let the responsibility of his suckling be upon me. She was then stoned to death.
1695.02 | 'Abdullah b. Buraida reported on the authority of his father that Ma'iz b. Malik al-Aslami came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:Allah's Messenger, I have wronged myself; I have committed adultery and I earnestly desire that you should purify me. He turned him away. On the following day, he (Ma'iz) again came to him and said: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) turned him away for the second time, and sent him to his people saying: Do you know if there is anything wrong with his mind. They denied of any such thing in him and said: We do not know him but as a wise good man among us, so far as we can judge. He (Ma'iz) came for the third time, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent him as he had done before. He asked about him and they informed him that there was nothing wrong with him or with his mind. When it was the fourth time, a ditch was dug for him and he (the Holy Prophet) pronounced judg- ment about him and he wis stoned. He (the narrator) said: There came to him (the Holy Prophet) a woman from Ghamid and said: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery, so purify me. He (the Holy Prophet) turned her away. On the following day she said: Allah's Messenger, Why do you turn me away? Perhaps, you turn me away as you turned away Ma'iz. By Allah, I have become pregnant. He said: Well, if you insist upon it, then go away until you give birth to (the child). When she was delivered she came with the child (wrapped) in a rag and said: Here is the child whom I have given birth to. He said: Go away and suckle him until you wean him. When she had weaned him, she came to him (the Holy Prophet) with the child who was holding a piece of bread in his hand. She said: Allah's Apostle, here is he as I have weaned him and he eats food. He (the Holy Prophet) entrusted the child to one of the Muslims and then pronounced punishment. And she was put in a ditch up to her chest and he commanded people and they stoned her. Khalid b Walid came forward with a stone which he flung at her head and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and so he abused her. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) heard his (Khalid's) curse that he had huried upon her. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Khalid, be gentle. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, she has made such a repentance that even if a wrongful tax-collector were to repent, he would have been forgiven. Then giving command regarding her, he prayed over her and she was buried.
1696.01 | Imran b. Husain reported that a woman from Juhaina came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and she had become pregnant because of adultery. She said:Allah's Apostle, I have done something for which (prescribed punishment) must be imposed upon me, so impose that. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) called her master and said: Treat her well, and when she delivers bring her to me. He did accordingly. Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) pronounced judgment about her and her clothes were tied around her and then he commanded and she was stoned to death. He then prayed over her (dead body). Thereupon Umar said to him: Allah's Apostle, you offer prayer for her, whereas she had committed adultery! Thereupon he said: She has made such a repentance that if it were to be divided among seventy men of Medina, it would be enough. Have you found any repentance better than this that she sacr ficed her life for Allah, the Majestic?
1696.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Yahya b. Abu Kathir.
1697 | Abu Huraira and Zaid b Khalid al-Juhani reported that one of the desert tribes came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:Messenger of Allah, I beg of you in the name of Allah that you pronounce judgment about me according to the Book of Allah. The second claimant who was wiser than him said: Well, decide amongst us according to the Book of Allah, but permit me (to say something). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon ham) said: Say. He said: My son was a servant in the house of this person and he committed adultery with his wife. I was informed that my son deserved stoning to death (as punishment for this offence). I gave one hundred goats and a slave girl as ransom for this. I asked the scholars (if this could serve as an expiation for this offence). They informed me that my son deserved one hundred lathes and exile for one year. and this woman deserved stoning (as she was married). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life. I will decide between you according to the Book of Allah. The slave-girl and the goats should be given back, and your son is to be punished with one hundred lashes and exile for one year. And, O Unais (b. Zuhaq al-Aslami), go to this woman in the morning, and if she makes a confession, then stone her. He (the narrator) said: He went to her in the morning and she made a confession. And Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made pronouncement about her and she was stoned to death.
1697 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.
1699.01 | Abdullah b. 'Umar reported that a Jew and a Jewess were brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who had committed adultery. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to the Jews and said:What do you find in Torah for one who commits adultery? They said: We darken their faces and make them ride on the donkey with their faces turned to the opposite direction (and their backs touching each other), and then they are taken round (the city). He said: Bring Torah if you are truthful. They brought it and recited it until when they came to the verse pertaining to stoning, the person who was reading placed his hand on the verse pertaining to stoning, and read (only that which was) between his hands and what was subsequent to that. Abdullah b. Salim who was at that time with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Command him (the reciter) to lift his hand. He lifted it and there was, underneath that, the verse pertaining to stoning. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) pronounced judgment about both of them and they were stoned. Abdullah b.

He (the Holy Prophet) called one of the scholars amongst them and said: I ask you in the name of Allah Who sent down the Torah on Moses if that is the prescribed punishment for adultery that you find in your Book. He said: No. Had you not asked me in the name of Allah, I would not have given you this information. We find stoning to death (as punishment prescribed in the Torah). But this (crime) became quite common amongst our aristocratic class. So when we caught hold of any rich person (indulging in this offence) we spared him, but when we caught hold of a helpless person we imposed the prescribed punishment upon him. We then said: Let us argree (on a punishment) which we can inflict both upon the rich and the poor. So We decided to blacken the face with coal and flog as a substitute punishment for stoning. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: O Allah, I am the first to revive Thy command when they had made it dead. He then commanded and he (the offender) was stoned to death. Allah, the Majestic and Glorious, sent down (this verse):" O Messenger, (the behaviour of) those who vie with one another in denying the truth should not grieve you..." up to" is vouchsafed unto you, accept it" (v. 41) 2176 It was said (by the Jews): Go to Muhammad; it he commands you to blacken the face and award flogging (as punishment for adultery), then accept it, but it he gives verdict for stoning, then avoid it. It was (then) that Allah, the Majestic and Great, sent down (these verses):" And they who do not judge in accordance with what Allah has revealed are, indeed, deniers of the truth" (v. 44) ;" And they who do not judge in accordance with what Allah has revealed-they, they indeed are the wrongdoers" (v. 45) ;" And they who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed-they are the iniquitous (v. 47).

Then there came a man with a small bucket containing some water. He threw it in a basin. We all fourteen hundred persons performed ablution using the water in plenty. Then there came after that eight persons and they said: Is there any water to perform ablution? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The ablution has already been performed.
1730.01 | Ibn 'Aun reported:I wrote to Nafi' inquiring from him whether it was necessary to extend (to the disbelievers) an invitation to accept (Islam) before meeting them in fight. He wrote (in reply) to me that it was necessary in the early days of Islam. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at the water. He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. On that very day, he captured Juwairiya bint al-Harith. Nafi' said that this tradition was related to him by Abdullah b. Umar who (himself) was among the raiding troops.
1730.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Aun and the name of Juwairiya bint al-Harith was mentioned beyond any doubt.
1731.01 | It has been reported from Sulaiman b. Buraida through his father that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) appointed anyone as leader of an army or detachment he would especially exhort him to fear Allah and to be good to the Muslims who were with him. He would say:Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war, do not embezzle the spoils; do not break your pledge; and do not mutilate (the dead) bodies; do not kill the children. When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of the Muhajireen and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajireen. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muslims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils of war or Fai' except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers). If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them. When you lay siege to a fort and the besieged appeal to you for protection in the name of Allah and His Prophet, do not accord to them the guarantee of Allah and His Prophet, but accord to them your own guarantee and the guarantee of your companions for it is a lesser sin that the security given by you or your companions be disregarded than that the security granted in the name of Allah and His Prophet be violated. When you besiege a fort and the besieged want you to let them out in accordance with Allah's Command, do not let them come out in accordance with His Command, but do so at your (own) command, for you do not know whether or not you will be able to carry out Allah's behest with regard to them.

Abu Burda through his father through his grandfather that the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) sent him and Mu'adh (on a mission) to the Yemen, and said (by way of advising them):Show leniency (to the people) ; don't be hard upon them; give them glad tidings (of Divine favours in this world and the Hereafter) ; and do not create aversion.

So he marched on and approached a village at or about the time of the Asr prayers. He said to the sun: Thou art subserviant (to Allah) and so am I. O Allah, stop it for me a little. It was stopped for him until Allah granted him victory. The people gathered the spoils of war (at one place). A fire approached the spoils to devour them, but it did not devour them. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Some of you have been guilty of misappropriation. So one man from each tribe should swear fealty to me. The did so (putting their hands into his). The hand of one man stuck to his hand and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Your tribe is guilty of misappropriation. Let all the members of your tribe swear fealty to me one by one. They did so, when the hands of two or three persons got stuck with his hand. He said: You have misappropriated. So they took out gold equal in volume to the head of a cow.

When we encountered the enemy, (some of the Muslims turned back (in fear). I saw that a man from the polytheists overpowered one of the Muslims. I turned round and attacked him from behind giving a blow between his neck and shoulder. He turned towards me and grappled with me in such a way that I began to see death staring me in the face. Then death overtook him and left me alone. I joined 'Umar b. al-Khattab who was saying: What has happened to the people (that they are retreating)? I said: It is the Decree of Allah. Then the people returned. (The battle ended in a victory for the Muslims) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat down (to distribute the spoils of war). He said: One who has killed an enemy and can bring evidence to prove it will get his belongings. So I stood up and said: Who will give evidence for me? Then I sat down. Then he (the Holy Prophet) said like this. I stood up (again) and said: Who will bear witness for me? He (the Holy Prophet) made the same observation the third time, and I stood up (once again). Now the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What has happened to you, O Abu Qatada? Then I related the (whole) story, to him. At this, one of the people said: He has told the truth. Messenger of Allah 1 The belongings of the enemy killed by him are with me. Persuade him to forgo his right (in my favour). (Objecting to this proposal) Abu Bakr said: BY Allah, this will not happen. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) will not like to deprive one of the lions from among the lions of Allah who fight in the cause of Allah and His Messenger and give thee his share of the booty. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said: He (Abu Bakr) has told the truth, and so give the belongings to him (Abu Qatada). So he gave them to me. I sold the armour (which was a part of my share of the booty) and bought with the sale proceeds a garden in the street of Banu Salama. This was the first property I acquired after embracing Islam. In a version of the hadith narrated by Laith, the words uttered by Abu Bakr are:" No, never! He will not give it to a fox from the Quraish leaving aside a lion from the lions of Allah among...." And the hadith is closed with the words:" The first property I acquired."

I wished I were between stronger persons. One of them made a sign to me and. said: Uncle, do you recognise Abu Jahl? 1 said: Yes. What do you want to do with him, O my nephew? He said: I have been told that he abuses the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). By Allah, in Whose Hand is my life, if I see him (I will grapple with him) and will not leave him until one of us who is destined to die earlier is killed. The narrator said: I wondered at this. Then the other made a sign to me and said similar words. Soon after I saw Abu Jahl. He was moving about among men. I said to the two boys: Don't you see? He is the man you were inquiring about. (As soon as they heard this), they dashed towards him, struck him with their swords until he was killed. Then they returned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him (to this effect). He asked: Which of you has killed him? Each one of them said: I have killed him. He said: Have you wiped your swords? They said: No. He examined their swords and said: Both of you have killed him.

'Auf b Malik (the narrator) came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him (to this effect). The latter asked Khalid:What prevented you from giving the booty to him? Khalid said: I thought it was too much. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Hand it over to him. Now when Khalid by Auf, the latter pulled him by his cloak and said (by way of chafing him): Hasn't the same thing happened what I reported to you from the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him)? When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) heard it. he was angry (and said): Khalid, don't give him, Khalid, don't give him. Are you going to desert the commanders appointed by roe? Your similitude and theirs is like a person who took camels and sheep for grazing. He grazed them and when it was time for them to have a drink, he brought them to a pool. So they drank from it, drinking away its clear water and leaving the turbid water below So the clear water (i. e. the best reward) is for you and the turbid water (i e. blame) is for them.
1753.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Auf b. Malik al-Ashja'i who said:I joined the expedition that marched under Zaid b. Haritha to Muta, and I received reinformcement from the Yemen. (After this introduction), the narrator narrated the tradition that had gone before except that in his version Auf was reported to have said (to Khalid): Khalid, didn't you know that the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) had decided In favour of giving the booty (sized from an enemy) to one who killed him? He (Khalid) said: Yes. but I thought it was too much.
1754 | It has been reported by Salama b. al-Akwa':We fought the Battle of Hawazin along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). (One day) when we were having our breakfast with the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him), a man came riding a red camel. He made it kneel down, extracted a strip of leather from its girth and tethered the camel with it. Then he began to take food with the people and look (curiously around). We were in a poor condition as some of us were on foot (being without any riding animals). All of a sudden, he left us hurriedy, came to his camel, untethered it, made it kneel down, mounted it and urged the beast which ran off with him. A man on a brown rhe-camel chased him (taking him for a spy). Salama (the narrator) said: I followed on foot. I ran on until I was near the thigh of the she-camel. I advanced further until I was near the haunches of the camel. I advanced still further until I caught hold of the nosestring of the camel. I made it kneel down. As soon as it placed its knee on the ground, I drew my sword and struck at the head, of the rider who fell down. I brought the camel driving it along with the man's baggage and weapons. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came forward to meet me and the people were with him. He asked: Who has killed the man? The people said: Ibn Akwa'. He said: Everything of the man is for him (Ibn Akwa').
1755 | It has been narrated on the authority of Salama (b. al-Akwa') who said:We fought against the Fazara, and Abu Bakr was the commander over us. He had been appointed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When we were only at an hour's distance from the water of the enemy, Abu Bakr ordered us to attack. We made a halt during the last part of the night to rest and then we attacked from all sides and reached their watering-place where a battle was fought. Some of the enemies were killed and some were taken prisoners. I saw a group of persons that consisted of women and children. I was afraid lest they should reach the mountain before me, so I shot an arrow between them and the mountain. When they saw the arrow, they stopped. So I brought them, driving them along. Among them was a woman from Banu Fazara. She was wearing a leather coat. With her was her daughter who was one of the prettiest girls in Arabia. I drove them along until I brought them to Abu Bakr who bestowed that girl upon me as a prize. So we arrived in Medina. I had not yet disrobed her when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) met me in the street and said: Give me that girl, O Salama. I said: Messenger of Allah, she has fascinated me. I had not yet disrobed her. When on the next day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) again met me in the street, he said: O Salama, give me that girl, may God bless your father. I said: She is for you, Messenger of Allah! By Allah. I have not yet disrobed her. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent her to the people of Mecca, and surrendered her as ransom for a number of Muslims who had been kept as prisoners at Mecca.
1756 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:If you come to a township (which has surrendered without a formal war) and stay therein, you have a share (that will be in the form of an award) in (the properties obtained from) it. If a township disobeys Allah and His Messenger (and actually fights against the Muslims) one-fifth of the booty seized therefrom is for Allah and His Apostle and the rest is for you.
1757.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Umar, who said:The properties abandoned by Banu Nadir were the ones which Allah bestowed upon His Apostle for which no expedition was undertaken either with cavalry or camelry. These properties were particularly meant for the Prophet (ﷺ). He would meet the annual expenditure of his family from the income thereof, and would spend what remained for purchasing horses and weapons as preparation for Jihad.
1757.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri.
1757.03 | It is reported by Zuhri that this tradition was narrated to him by Malik b. Aus who said:Umar b. al-Khattab sent for me and I came to him when the day had advanced. I found him in his house sitting on his bare bed-stead, reclining on a leather pillow. He said (to me): Malik, some people of your tribe have hastened to me (with a request for help). I have ordered a little money for them. Take it and distribute it among them. I said: I wish you had ordered somebody else to do this job. He said: Malik, take it (and do what you have been told). At this moment (his man-servant) Yarfa' came in and said: Commander of the Faithful, what do you say about Uthman, Abd al-Rabman b. 'Auf, Zubair and Sa'd (who have come to seek an audience with you)? He said: Yes, and permitted them. so they entered. Then he (Yarfa') came again and said: What do you say about 'Ali and Abbas (who are present at the door)? He said: Yes, and permitted them to enter. Abbas said: Commander of the Faithful, decide (the dispute) between me and this sinful, treacherous, dishonest liar. The people (who were present) also said: Yes. Commander of the Faithful, do decide (the dispute) and have mercy on them. Malik b. Aus said: I could well imagine that they had sent them in advance for this purpose (by 'Ali and Abbas). 'Umar said: Wait and be patient. I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained, don't you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity"? They said: Yes. Then he turned to Abbas and 'Ali and said: I adjure you both by Allah by Whose order the heavens and earth are sustained, don't you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity"? They (too) said: Yes. (Then) Umar said: Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, had done to His Messenger (ﷺ) a special favour that He has not done to anyone else except him. He quoted the Qur'anic verse:" What Allah has bestowed upon His Apostle from (the properties) of the people of township is for Allah and His Messenger". The narrator said: I do not know whether he also recited the previous verse or not. Umar continued: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) distrbuted among you the properties abandoned by Banu Nadir. By Allah, he never preferred himself over you and never appropriated anything to your exclusion. (After a fair distribution in this way) this property was left over. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would meet from its income his annual expenditure, and what remained would be deposited in the Bait-ul-Mal. (Continuing further) he said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained. Do you know this? They said: Yes. Then he adjured Abbas and 'All as he had adjured the other persons and asked: Do you both know this? They said: Yes. He said: When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed away, Abu Bakr said:" I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)." Both of you came to demand your shares from the property (left behind by the Messenger of Allah). (Referring to Hadrat 'Abbas), he said: You demanded your share from the property of your nephew, and he (referring to 'Ali) demanded a share on behalf of his wife from the property of her father. Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said:" We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity." So both of you thought him to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that he was true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. When Abu Bakr passed away and (I have become) the successor of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him), you thought me to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that I am true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. I became the guardian of this property. Then you as well as he came to me. Both of you have come and your purpose is identical. You said: Entrust the property to us. I said: If you wish that I should entrust it to you, it will be on the condition that both of you will undertake to abide by a pledge made with Allah that you will use it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used it. So both of you got it. He said: Wasn't it like this? They said: Yes. He said: Then you have (again) come to me with the request that I should adjudge between you. No, by Allah. I will not give any other judgment except this until the arrival of the Doomsday. If you are unable to hold the property on this condition, return it to me.
1757.04 | The same hadith has been narrated by a different chain of transmitters with a slight variation in wording:'Umar b. al-Khattab sent for me and said: Some families from your tribe have come to me (then follows the foregoing hadith) by Malik with the difference that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would spend on his family for a year. And sometimes Ma'mar said: He would retain sustenance for his family for a year, and what was left of that he spent in the cause of Allah, the Majestic and Exalted.
1758 | It is narrated on the authority of 'A'isha who said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed away, his wives made up their minds to send 'Uthman b. 'Affan (as their spokesman) to Abu Bakr to demand from him their share from the legacy of the Prophet (ﷺ). (At this), A'isha said to them: Hasn't the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" We (Prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity"?
1759.01 | It is narrated on the authority of Urwa b. Zubair who narrated from A'isha that she informed him that Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), sent someone to Abu Bakr to demand from him her share of the legacy left by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from what Allah had bestowed upon him at Medina and Fadak and what was left from one-filth of the income (annually received) from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity." The household of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) will live on the income from these properties, but, by Allah, I will not change the charity of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from the condition in which it was in his own time. I will do the same with it as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upun him) himself used to do. So Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr for this reason. She forsook him and did not talk to him until the end of her life. She lived for six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When she died, her husband. 'Ali b. Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself. During the lifetime of Fatima, 'All received (special) regard from the people. After she had died, he felt estrangement in the faces of the people towards him. So he sought to make peace with Abu Bakr and offer his allegiance to him. He had not yet owed allegiance to him as Caliph during these months. He sent a person to Abu Bakr requesting him to visit him unaccompanied by anyone (disapproving the presence of Umar). 'Umar said to Abu Bakr: BY Allah, you will not visit them alone. Abu Bakr said: What will they do to me? By Allah, I will visit them. And he did pay them a visit alone. 'All recited Tashahhud (as it is done in the beginning of a religious sermon) ; then said: We recognise your moral excellence and what Allah has bestowed upon you. We do not envy the favour (i. e. the Catiphate) which Allah nas conferred upon you; but you have done it (assumed the position of Caliph) alone (without consulting us), and we thought we had a right (to be consulted) on account of our kinship with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He continued to talk to Abu Bakr (in this vein) until the latter's eyes welled up with tears. Then Abd Bakr spoke and said: By Allah, in Whose Hand is my life, the kinship of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is dearer to me than the kinship of my own people. As regards the dispute that has arisen between you and me about these properties, I have not deviated from the right course and I have not given up doing about them what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do. So 'Ali said to Abu Bakr: This aftetnoon is (fixed) for (swearing) allegiance (to you). So when Abu Bakr had finished his Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and recited Tashahhud, and described the status of 'Ali, his delay in swearing allegiance and the excuse which lie had offered to him (for this delay). (After this) he asked for God's forgiveness. Then 'Ali b. Abu Talib recited the Tashahhud. extolled the merits of Abu Bakr and (said that) his action was nott prompted by any jealousy of Abu Bakr on his part or his refusal to accept the high position which Allah had conferred upon him, (adding: ) But we were of the opinion that we should have a share in the government, but the matter had been decided without taking us into confidence, and this displeased us. (Hence the delay in offering allegiance. The Muslims were pleased with this (explanation) and they said: You have done the right thing. The Muslims were (again) favourably inclined to 'Ali since he adopted the proper course of action.
1759.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha that Fatima and 'Abbas approached Abu Bakr, soliciting transfer of the legacy of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to them. At that time, they were demanding his (Holy Prophet's) lands at Fadak and his share from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said to them:I have heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then he quoted the hadith having nearly the same meaning as the one which has been narrated by Uqail on the authority of al-Zuhri (and which his gone before) except that in his version he said: Then 'Ali stood up, extolled the merits of Abu Bakr mentioned his superiority, and his earlier acceptance of Islam. Then he walked to Abu Bakr and swore allegiance to him. (At this) people turned towards 'Ali and said: you have done the right thing. And they became favourably inclined to 'Ali after he had adopted the proper course of action.
1759.03 | It has been narrated by 'Urwa b Zubair on the authority of 'A'isha, wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), that Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), requested Abu Bakr, after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him), that he should set apart her share from what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had left from the properties that God had bestowed upon him. Abu Bakr said to her:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is Sadaqa (charity)." The narrator said: She (Fatima) lived six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and she used to demand from Abu Bakr her share from the legacy of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from Khaibar, Fadak and his charitable endowments at Medina. Abu Bakr refused to give her this, and said: I am not going to give up doing anything which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do. I am afraid that it I go against his instructions in any matter I shall deviate from the right course. So far as the charitable endowments at Medina were concerned, 'Umar handed them over to 'Ali and Abbas, but 'Ali got the better of him (and kept the property under his exclusive possession). And as far as Khaibar and Fadak were concerned 'Umar kept them with him, and said: These are the endowments of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (to the Umma). Their income was spent on the discharge of the responsibilities that devolved upon him on the emergencies he had to meet. And their management was to be in the hands of one who managed the affairs (of the Islamic State). The narrator said: They have been managed as such up to this day.
1760.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:My heirs cannot share even a dinar (from my legacy) ; what I leave behind after paving maintenance allowance to my wives and remuneration to my manager is (to go in) charity.
1760.02 | A similar hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Zinad through a different chain of transmitters.
1761 | It his been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is a charitable endowment."
1762.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) allowed two shares from the spoils to the horseman and one share to the footman.
1762.02 | The same tradition has been narrated on the authority of Ubaidullah by a different chain of transmitters who do not mention the words:" from the booty".
1763 | It has been narrated on the authority of `Umar b. al-Khattab who said:When it was the day on which the Battle of Badr was fought, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) cast a glance at the infidels, and they were one thousand while his own Companions were three hundred and nineteen. The Prophet (ﷺ) turned (his face) towards the Qibla. Then he stretched his hands and began his supplication to his Lord: "O Allah, accomplish for me what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, bring about what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed. Thou will not be worshipped on this earth." He continued his supplication to his Lord, stretching his hands, facing the Qibla, until his mantle slipped down from his shoulders. So Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his mantle and put it on his shoulders. Then he embraced him from behind and said: Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice you, and He will fulfill for you what He has promised you. So Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, revealed (the Qur'anic verse): "When ye appealed to your Lord for help, He responded to your call (saying): I will help you with one thousand angels coming in succession." So Allah helped him with angels. Abu Zumail said that the hadith was narrated to him by Ibn `Abbas who said: While on that day a Muslim was chasing a disbeliever who was going ahead of him, he heard over him the swishing of the whip and the voice of the rider saying: Go ahead, Haizum! He glanced at the polytheist who had (now) fallen down on his back. When he looked at him (carefully he found that) there was a scar on his nose and his face was torn as if it had been lashed with a whip, and had turned green with its poison. An Ansari came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and related this (event) to him. He said: You have told the truth. This was the help from the third heaven. The Muslims that day (i.e. the day of the Battle of Badr) killed seventy persons and captured seventy. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Abu Bakr and `Umar (Allah be pleased with them): What is your opinion about these captives? Abu Bakr said: They are our kith and kin. I think you should release them after getting from them a ransom. This will be a source of strength to us against the infidels. It is quite possible that Allah may guide them to Islam. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What is your opinion, Ibn Khattab? He said: Messenger of Allah, I do not hold the same opinion as Abu Bakr. I am of the opinion that you should hand them over to us so that we may cut off their heads. Hand over `Aqil to `Ali that he may cut off his head, and hand over such and such relative to me that I may cut off his head. They are leaders of the disbelievers and veterans among them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) approved the opinion of Abu Bakr and did not approve what I said. The next day when I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I found that both he and Abu Bakr were sitting shedding tears. I said: Messenger of Allah, why are you and your Companion shedding tears? Tell me the reason. For I will weep, or I will at least pretend to weep in sympathy with you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I weep for what has happened to your companions for taking ransom (from the prisoners). I was shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought to me as close as this tree. (He pointed to a tree close to him.) Then God revealed the verse: "It is not befitting for a prophet that he should take prisoners until the force of the disbelievers has been crushed..." to the end of the verse: "so eat ye the spoils of war, (it is) lawful and pure. So Allah made booty lawful for them."
1764.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira who said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent some horsemen to Najd. They captured a man. He was from the tribe of Banu Hanifa and was called Thumama b. Uthal. He was the chief of the people of Yamama. People bound him with one of the pillars of the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out to (see) him. He said: O Thumama, what do you think? He replied: Muhammad, I have good opinion of you. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you do me a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be pon him) lefthim (in this condition) for two days, (and came to him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If you do a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) left him until the next day when he (came to him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If you do me a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you want wealth ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Set Thumama free. He went to a palm-grove near the mosque and took a bath. Then he entered the mosque and said: I bear testimony (to the truth) that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His bondman and His messenger. O Muhammad, by Allah, there was no face on the earth more hateful to me than your face, but (now) your face has become to me the dearest of all faces. By Allah, there was no religion more hateful to me than your religion, but (now) your religion has become the dearest of all religions to me. By Allah, there was no city more hateful to me than your city, but (now) your city has become the dearest of all cities to me. Your horsemen captured me when I intended going for Umra. Now what is your opinion (in the matter)? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) announced good tidings to him and told him to go on 'Umra. When he reached Mecca, somebody said to him: Have you changed your religion? He said: No! I have rather embraced Islam with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). By Allah, you will not get a single grain of wheat from Yamama until it is permitted by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
1764.02 | The same tradition has been narrated by a different chain of transmitters with a slight difference in the wording.
1765 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira who said:We were (sitting) in the mosque when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us and said: (Let us) go to the Jews. We went out with him until we came to them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and called out to them (saying): O ye assembly of Jews, accept Islam (and) you will be safe. They said: Abu'l-Qasim, you have communicated (God's Message to us). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I want this (i. e. you should admit that God's Message has been communicated to you), accept Islam and you would be safe. They said: Abu'l-Qisim, you have communicated (Allah's Message). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I want this... - He said to them (the same words) the third time (and on getting the same reply) he added: You should know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I wish that I should expel you from this land Those of you who have any property with them should sell it, otherwise they should know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle (and they may have to go away leaving everything behind).
1766.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Umar that the Jews of Banu Nadir and Banu Quraiza fought against the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who expelled Banu Nadir, and allowed Quraiza to stay on, and granted favour to them until they too fought against him Then he killed their men, and distributed their women, children and properties among the Muslims, except that some of them had joined the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who granted them security. They embraced Islam. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned out all the Jews of Medina. Banu Qainuqa' (the tribe of 'Abdullah b. Salim) and the Jews of Banu Haritha and every other Jew who was in Medina.
1766.02 | A similar hadith has been transmitted by a different chain of narrators, but the hadith narrated by Ibn Juraij is more detailed and complete.
1767.01 | It has been narrated by 'Umar b. al-Khattib that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say:I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and will not leave any but Muslim.
1767.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zubair with the same chain of transmitters.
1768.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri who said:The people of Quraiza surrendered accepting the decision of Sa'd b. Mu'adh about them. Accordingly, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent for Sa'd who came to him riding a donkey. When he approached the mosque, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to the Ansar: Stand up to receive your chieftain. Then he said (to Sa'd): These people have surrendered accepting your decision. He (Sa'd) said: You will kill their fighters and capture their women and children. (Hearing this), the Prophet (ﷺ) said: You have adjudged by the command of God. The narrator is reported to have said: Perhaps he said: You have adjudged by the decision of a king. Ibn Muthanna (in his version of the tradition) has not mentioned the alternative words.
1768.02 | Through the same chain of transmitters Shu'ba has narrated the same tradition in which he says that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said (to Sa'd):You have adjudged according to the command of God. And once he said: you have adjudged by the decision of a king.
1769.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of A'isha who said:Sa'd was wounded on the day of the Battle of the Ditch. A man from the Quraish called Ibn al-Ariqah shot at him an arrow which pierced the artery in the middle of his forearm. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pitched a tent for him in the mosque and would inquire after him being in close proximity. When he returned from the Ditch and laid down his arms and took a bath, the angel Gabriel appeared to him and he was removing dust from his hair (as if he had just returned from the battle). The latter said: You have laid down arms. By God, we haven't (yet) laid them down. So march against them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked: Where? He pointed to Banu Quraiza. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) fought against them. They surrendered at the command of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but he referred the decision about them to Sa'd who said: I decide about them that those of them who can fight be killed, their women and children taken prisoners and their properties distributed (among the Muslims).
1769.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Hisham (who learnt it from his father) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said (to Sa'd):You have adjudged their case with the judgment of God. the Exalted and Glorified.
1769.03 | It has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha that Sa'd's wound became dry and was going to heal when he prayed:O God, surely Thou knowest that nothing is dearer to me than that I should fight for Thy cause against the people who disbeliever Your Messenger (ﷺ) and turned him out (from his native place). If anything yet remains to be decided from the war against the Quraish, spare my life so that I may fight against them in Thy cause. O Lord, I think Thou hast ended the war between us and them. If Thou hast done so, open my wound (so that it may discharge) and cause my death thereby. So the wound begin to bleed from the front part of his neck. The people were not scared except when the blood flowed towards them, and in the mosque along with Sa'd's tent was the tent of Banu Ghifar. They said: O people of the tent, what is it that is coming to us from you? Lo! it was Sa'd's wound that was bleeding and he died thereof.
1769.04 | This tradition has been narrated by Hishim through the same chain of transmitters with a little difference in the wording. He said:(His wound) began to bleed that very night and it continued to bleed until he died. He has made the addition that it was then that (a non-believing) poet said: Hark, O Sa'd, Sa'd of Banu Mu'adh, What have the Quraiaa and Nadir done? By thy life! Sa'd b. Mu'adh>br> Was steadfast on the morn they departed. You have left your cooking-pot empty, While the cooking-pot of the people is hot and boiling. Abu Hubab the nobleman has said, O Qainuqa', do not depart. They were weighty in their country just aa rocks are weighty in Maitan.
1770 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah who said:On the day he returned from the Battle of Ahzab, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made for us an announcement that nobody would say his Zuhr prayer but in the quarters of Banu Quraiza (Some) people, being afraid that the time for prayer would expire, said their prayers before reaching the street of Banu Quraiza. The others said: We will not say our prayer except where the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has ordered us to say it even if the time expires. When he learned of the difference in the view of the two groups of the people, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be tipon him) did not blame anyone from the two groups.
1771.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said:When the Muhajirs migrated from Mecca to Medina; they came (in a state that) they had not anything (i. e. money) in theirhands, while the Ansar possessed lands and date palms. They divided their properties with the Muhajirs. The Ansar divided and gave them on the condition that they would give half the fruit from the orchards every year, and the Muhajirs would recompense them by working with them and putting in labour. The mother of Anas b. Malik was called Umm Sulaim and she was also the mother of 'Abdullah b. Talha who was a brother of Anas from his mother's side. The mother of Anas had given the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) her date-palms. He bestowed them upon Umm Aiman, the slave-girl who had been freed by him and was the mother of Usama b. Zaid. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had finished the war with the people of Khaibar and returned to Medina, the Muhajirs returned to the Ansar all the gifts which they had given them out of the fruits. (Anas b. Malik said: ) The Messenger of. Allah (ﷺ) returned to my mother her date-palms and gave to Umm Aiman instead of them date-palms from his orchard. Ibn Shihab says that Umm Aiman was the mother of Usama b. Zaid who was the slave-girl of 'Abdullah b. 'Abd-ul-Muttalib and hailed from Abyssinia. When Amina gave birth to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) after the death of his father, Umm Aiman used to nurse him until he grew up. He (later on) freed her and married her to Zaid b. Haritha. She died five months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
1771.02 | It has been narrated by Anas that (after his migration to Medina) a person placed at the Prophet's (ﷺ) disposal some date-palms growing on his land until the lands of Quraiza and Nadir were conquered. Then he began to return to him whatever he had received. (In this connection) my people told me to approach the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and ask from him what his people had given him or a portion thereof, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had bestowed those trees upon Umm Aiman. So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he gave hem (back) to me. Umm Aiman (also) came (at this time). She put the cloth round my neck and said:No, by Allah, we will not give to, you what he has granted to me. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Umm Aiman, let him have them and for you are such and such trees instead. But she said: By Allah, there is no god besides Him. No, never! The Prophet (ﷺ) continued saying: (You will get) such and such. until he had granted her ten times or nearly ten times more (than the original gift).
1772.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mughaffal who said I found a bag containing fat on the day of the Battle of Khaibar. I caught hold of it and said:I will not give anything today from it to anybody. Then I turned round and saw that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was smiling (at my words).
1772.02 | This tradition has been transmitted by a different chain of narrators with a different wording, the last in the chain being the same narrator, (i. e. 'Abdullah b. Mughaffal), who said:A bag containing food and fat was thrown to us. I lept forward to catch it. Then I turned round and saw (to my surprise) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I felt ashamed of my act in his presence.
1772.03 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Shu'ba with a slight variation of words.
1773.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas who learnt the tradition personally from Abu Safyan. The latter said:I went out (on a mercantile venture) during the period (of truce) between me and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). While I was in Syria, the letter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was handed over to Hiraql (Ceasar), the Emperor of Rome (who was on a visit to Jerusalem at that time). The letter was brought by Dihya Kalbi who delivered it to the governor of Busra The governor passed it on to Hiraql, (On receiving the letter), he said: Is there anyone from the people of this man who thinks that he is a prophet. People said: Yes. So, I was called along with a few others from the Quraish. We were admitted to Hiraql and he seated usbefore him. He asked: Which of you has closer kinship with the man who thinks that he is a prophet? Abu Sufyan said: I. So they seated me in front of him and stated my companions behind me. Then, he called his interpreter and said to him: Tell them that I am going to ask this fellow (i. e. Abu Sufyan) about the man who thinks that he is a prophet. It he tells me a lie, then refute him. Abu Sufyan told (the narrator): By God, if there was not the fear that falsehood would be imputed to me I would have lied. (Then) Hiraqi said to his interpreter: Inquire from him about his ancestry, I said: He is of good ancestry among us. He asked: Has there been a king among his ancestors? I said: No. He asked: Did you accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood? I said: No. He asked: Who are his follower people of high status or low status? I said: (They are) of low status. He asked: Are they increasing in number or decreasing? I said. No. they are rather increasing. He asked: Does anyone give up his religion, being dissatisfied with it, after having embraced it? I said: No. He asked: Have you been at war with him? I said: Yes. He asked: How did you fare in that war? I said: The war between us and him has been wavering like a bucket, up at one turn and down at the other (i. e. the victory has been shared between us and him by turns). Sometimes he suffered loss at our hands and sometimes we suffered loss at his (hand). He asked: Has he (ever) violated his covenant? I said: No. but we have recently concluded a peace treaty with him for a petiod and we do not know what he is going to do about it. (Abu Sufyin said on oath that he could not interpolate in this dialogue anything from himself more than these words ) He asked: Did anyone make the proclamation (Of prophethood) before him? I said: No. He (now) said to his interpreter: Tell him, I asked him about his ancestry and he had replied that he had the best ancestry. This is the case with Prophets; they are the descendants of the noblest among their people (Addressing Abu Sufyan), he continued: I asked you if there had been a king among his ancestors. You said that there had been none. If there had been a king among his ancestors, I would have said that he was a man demanding his ancestral kingdom. I asked you about his followers whether they were people of high or low status, and you said that they were of rather low status. Such are the followers of the Prophets. I asked you whether you used to accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood, and you said that you did not. So I have understood that when he did not allow himself to tell a lie about the poeple, he would never go to the length of forging a falsehood about Allah. I asked you whether anyone renounced his religion being dissatisfied with it after he had embraced it, and you replied in the negative. Faith is like this when it enters the depth of the heart (it perpetuates them). I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You said they were increasing. Faith is like this until it reaches its consummation. I asked you whether you had been at war with him, and you replied that you had been and that the victory between you and him had been shared by turns, sometimes he suffering loss at your hand and sometimes you suffering lost at his. This is how the Prophets are tried before the final victory its theirs. I asked you whether he (ever) violated his covenant, and you said that he did not. This is how the Prophets behave. They never violate (their covenants). I asked you whether anyone before him had proclaimed the same thing, and you replied in the negative. I said: If anyone had made the same proclamation before, I would have thought that he was a man following what had been proclaimed before. (Then) he asked: What does he enjoin upon you? I said: He exhorts us to offer Salat, to pay Zakat, to show due regard to kinship and to practise chastity. He said: It what you have told about him is true, he is certainly a Prophet. I knew that he was to appear but I did not think that he would be from among you. If I knew that I would be able to reach him. I would love to meet him; and it I had been with him. I would have washed his feet (out of reverence). His dominion would certainly extend to this place which is under my feet. Then he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may pface be upon him) and read it. The letter ran as follows:" In the name of Allah, Most Gracious and Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Romans. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. After this, I extend to you the invitation to accept Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe. Accept Islam, God will give you double the reward. And if you turn away, upon you will be the sin of your subjects." O People of the Book, come to the word that is common between us that we should worship none other than Allah, should not ascribe any partner to Him and some of us should not take their fellows as Lords other than Allah. If they turn away, you should say that we testify to our being Muslims [iii. 64]." When he hid finished the reading of the letter, noise and confused clamour was raise around him, and he ordered us to leave. Accordingly, we left. (Addressing my companions) while we were coming out (of the place). I said: Ibn Abu Kabsha (referring sarcastically to the Holy Prophet) has come to wield a great power. Lo! (even) the king of the Romans is afraid of him. I continued to believe that the authority of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would triumph until God imbued me with (the spirit of) Islam.
1773.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Shihab with the same chain of transmitters but with the addition:" When Allah inflicted defeat on the armies of Persia, Caesar moved from Hims to Aelia (Bait al-Maqdis) for thanking Allah as He granted him victory." In this hadith these words occur:" From Muhammad, servant of Allah and His Messenger," and said:" The sin of your followers," and also said the words:" to the call of Islam".
1774.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) wrote to Chosroes (King of Persia), Caesar (Emperor of Rome), Negus (King of Abyssinia) and every (other) despot inviting them to Allah, the Exalted. And this Negus was not the one for whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said the funeral prayers.
1774.02 | The tradition has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik (the same narrator) through a different chain of transmitters, but this version does not mention:" And he was not the Negus for whom the Prophet (ﷺ) had said the funeral prayers."
1774.03 | It has been narrated on the authority of the same narrator through another chain of transmitters with the same difference in the wording.
1775.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of 'Abbas who said:I was in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the Day of Hunain. I and Abd Sufyan b. Harith b. 'Abd al-Muttalib stuck to the Messenaer of Allah (ﷺ) and we did not separate from him. And the Messenger of Allah (may place be upon him) was riding on his white mule which had been presented to him by Farwa b. Nufitha al-Judhami. When the Muslims had an encounter with the disbelievers, the Muslims fled, falling back, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to spur his mule towards the disbelievers. I was holding the bridle of the mule of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) checking it from going very fast, and Abu Sufyan was holding the stirrup of the (mule of the) Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), who said: Abbas, call out to the people of al-Samura. Abbas (who was a man with a loud voice) called out at the top of the voice: Where are the people of Samura? (Abbas said: ) And by God, when they heard my voice, they came back (to us) as cows come back to their calves, and said: We are present, we are present! 'Abbas said: They began to fight the infidels. Then there was a call to The Ansar. Those (who called out to them) shouted: O ye party of the Ansar! O party of the Ansar! Banu al-Harith b. al-Khazraj were the last to be called. Those (who called out to them) shouted: O Banu Al-Harith b. al-Khazraj! O BanU Harith b. al-Khazraj! And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who was riding on his mule looked at their fight with his neck stretched forward and he said: This is the time when the fight is raging hot. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took (some) pebbles and threw them in the face of the infidels. Then he said: By the Lord of Muhammad, the infidels are defeated. 'Abbas said: I went round and saw that the battle was in the same condition in which I had seen it. By Allah, it remained in the same condition until he threw the pebbles. I continued to watch until I found that their force had been spent out and they began to retreat.
1775.02 | A version of the tradition has been transmitted through another chain of narrators. In this version the words uttered by the Prophet (ﷺ) (after he had thrown the pebbles in the face of the enemy) are reported as:" By the Lord of the Ka'ba, they have been defeated." And there is at the end the addition of the words:" Until Allah defeated them" (and I imagine) as if I saw the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) chasing them on his mule.
1775.03 | 'Abbas reported:I was with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) on the Day of Hunain. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation that the hadith transmitted by Yonus and Ma'mar is more detailed and complete.
1776.01 | It has been narratedon the authority of Abu Ishaq who said:A man asked Bara' (b. 'Azib): Did you run away on the Day of Hunain. O, Abu Umira? He said: No, by Allah, The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not turn his back; (what actually happened was that) some young men from among his companions, who were hasty and who were either without any arms or did not have abundant arms, advanced and met a party of archers (who were so good shots) that their arrows never missed the mark. This party (of archers) belonged to Banu Hawazin and Banu Nadir. They shot at the advancing young men and their arrows were not likely to miss their targets. So these young men turned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while he was riding on his white mule and Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith b. 'Abd al-Muttalib was leading him. (At this) he got down from his mule, invoked God's help, and called out: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am the son of 'Abd al-Muttalib. Then he deployed his men into battle array.
1776.02 | It has been narrated (through a different chain of transmitters) by Abu Ishiq that a person said to Bara' (b. 'Azib):Abu Umara, did you flee on the Day of Hunain? He replied: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not retreat. (What actually happened was that some hasty young men who were either inadequately armed or were unarmed met a group of men from Banu Hawazin and Banu Nadir who happened to be (excellent) archers. The latter shot at them a volley of arrows that did not miss. The people turned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Abu Sufyan b. Harith was leading his mule. So he got down, prayed and invoked God's help. He said: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib. O God, descend Thy help. Bara' continued: When the battle grew fierce. we, by God. would seek protection by his side, and the bravest among us was he who confronted the onslaught and it was the Prophet (ﷺ).
1776.03 | It has been narrated through a still different chain of transmitters by the same narrator (i. e. Abu Ishaq) who said:I heard from Bara' who was asked by a man from the Qais tribe: Did you run away from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the Day of Hunain? Bara' said: But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not run away. On that day Banu Hawzzin took part in the battle as archers (on the side of the disbelievers). When we attacked them, they retreated and we fell upon the booty; (they rallied) and advanced towards us with arrows. (At that time) I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) riding on his white mule and Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith was holding its bridle. He (the Messenger of Allah was saying: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am a descendant of 'Abd al-Muttalib.
1776.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Bara' with another chain of transmitters, but this hadith is short as compared with other ahadith which are more detailed.
1777 | This tradition has been narrated on the authority of Salama who said:We fought by the side of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at Hunain. When we encountered the enemy, I advanced and ascended a hillock. A man from the enemy side turned towards me and I shot him with an arrow. He (ducked and) hid himself from me. I could not understand what he did, but (all of a sudden) I saw that a group of people appeared from the other hillock. They and the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) met in combat, but the Companions of the Prophet turned back and I too turned back defeated. I had two mantles, one of which I was wrapping round the waist (covering the lower part of my body) and the other I was putting around my shoulders. My waist-wrapper got loose and I held the two mantles together. (In this downcast condition) I passed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who was riding on his white mule. He said: The son of Akwa' finds himself to be utterly perplexed. Wher. the Companions gathered round him from all sides. the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got down from his mule. picked up a handful of dust from the ground, threw it into their (enemy) faces and said: May these faces be deformed 1 There was no one among the enemy whose eyes were not filled with the dust from this handful. So they turned back fleeing. and Allah the Exalted and Glorious defeated them, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) distributed their booty among the Muslims.
1778 | It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Amr who said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) besieged the people of Ta'if, but did get victory over them. He said: God willing, we shall return. His Companions said: Shall we depart without having conquered it? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: (All right) make a raid in the morning. They did so. and were wounded (with the arrows showered upon them). So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We shall depart tomorrow. (The narrator says): (Now) this (announcement) pleased them, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) laughed at (their waywardness).
1779 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that when (the news of) the advance of Abu Sufyan (at the head of a force) reached him. the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) held consultations with his Companions. The narrator said:Abu Bakr spoke (expressing his own views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him. Then spoke 'Umar (expressing his views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him (too). Then Sa'd b. 'Ubada stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, you want us (to speak). By God in Whose control is my life, if you order us to plunge our horses into the sea, we would do so. If you order us to goad our horses to the most distant place like Bark al-Ghimad, we would do so. The narrator said: Now the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called upon the people (for the encounter). So they set out and encamped at Badr. (Soon) the water-carriers of the Quraish arrived. Among them was a black slave belonging to Banu al-Hajjaj. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) caught him and interrogated him about Abu Sufyan and his companions. He said: I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl, Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him. Then he said: All right, I will tell you about Abu Sufyan. They would stop beating him and then ask him (again) about Abu Sufyan. He would again say', I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl. 'Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him likewise. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was standing in prayer. When he saw this he finished his prayer and said: By Allah in Whose control is my life, you beat him when he is telling you the truth, and you let him go when he tells you a lie. The narrator said: Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is the place where so and so would be killed. He placed his hand on the earth (saying) here and here; (and) none of them fell away from the place which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had indicated by placing his hand on the earth.
1780.01 | It has been narrated by 'Abdullah b. Rabah from Abu Huraira, who said:Many deputations came to Mu'awiya. This was in the month of Ramadan. We would prepare food for one another. Abu Huraira was one of those who frequently invited us to his house. I said: Should I not prepare food and invite them to my place? So I ordered meals to be prepared Then I met Abu Huraira in the evening and said: (You will have) your meals with me tonight. He said: You have forestalled me. I said: Yes, and invited them. (When they had finished with the meals) Abu Huraira said: Should I not tell yon a tradition from your traditions, O ye assembly of the Ansar? He then gave an account of the Conquest of Mecca and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) advanced until he reached Mecca. He deputed Zubair on his right flank and Khalid on the left, and he despatched Abu Ubaida with the force that had no armour. They advanced to the interior of the valley. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in the midst of a large contingent of fighters. He saw me and said: Abu Huraira. I said: I am here at your call, Messenger of Allah I He said: Let no one come to me except the Ansar, so call to me the Ansar (only). Abu Huraira continued: So they gathered round him. The Quraish also gathered their ruffians and their (lowly) followers, and said: We send these forward. If they get anything, we shall be with them (to share it), and if misfortune befalls them, we shall pay (as compensation) whatever we are asked for. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said (to the Ansar): You see the ruffians and the (lowly) followers of the Quraish. And he indicated by (striking) one of his hands over the other that they should be killed and said: Meet me at as-Safa. Then we went on (and) if any one of us wanted that a certain person should be killed, he was killed, and none could offer any resistance. Abu Huraira continued: Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger of Allah, the blood of the Quraish has become very cheap. There will be no Quraish from this day on. Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Who enters the house of Abu Sufyan, he will be safe. Some of the Ansar whispered among themselves: (After all), love for his city and tenderness towards his relations have overpowered him. Abu Huraira said: (At this moment) revelation came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and when he was going to receive the Revelation, we understood it, and when he was (actually) receiving it, none of us would dare raise his eyes to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) until the revelation came to an end. When the revelation came to an end, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: O ye Assembly of the Ansar! They said: Here we are at your disposal, Messenger of Allah. He said: You were saying that love for his city and tenderness towards his people have overpowered this man. They said: So it was. He said: No, never. I am a bondman of God and His Messenger. I migrated towards God and towards you. I will live with you and will die with you. So, they (the Ansar) turned towards him in tears and they were saying: By Allah, we said what we said because of our tenacious attachment to Allah and His Messenger. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Surely, Allah and His Messenger testify to your assertions and accept your apology. The narrator continued: People turned to the house of Abu Sufyan and people locked their doors. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) proceeded until he approached the (Black) Stone. He kissed it and circumambulated the Ka'ba. He reached near an idol by the side of the Ka'ba which was worshipped by the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had a bow in his hand, and he was holding it from a corner. When he came near the idol, he began to pierce its eyes with the bow and (while doing so) was saying: Truth has been established and falsehood has perished. When he had finished the circumambulation, he came to Safa', ascended it to a height from where he could see the Ka'ba, raised his hands (in prayer) and began to praise Allah and prayed what he wanted to pray.
1780.02 | The tradition has been narrated by a different chain of transmitters with the following additions:(i) Then be (the Messenger of Allah) said with his hands one upon the other: Kill them (who stand in your way).... (ii) They (the Ansar) replied: We said so, Messenger of Allah! He said: What is my name? I am but Allah's bondman and His Messenger.
1780.03 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Rabah who said:We came to Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan as a deputation and Abu Huraira was among us. Each of us would prepare food for his companions turn by turn for a day. (Accordingly) when it was my turn I said: Abu Huraira, it is my turn today. So they came to my place. The food was not yet ready, so I said to Abu Huraira: I wish you could narrate to us a tradition from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) until the food was ready. (Complying with my request) Abu Huraira said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the day of the Conquest of Mecca. He appointed Khalid b. Walid as commander of the right flank, Zubair as commander of the left flank, and Abu 'Ubaida as commander of the foot-soldiers (who were to advance) to the interior of the valley. He (then) said: Abu Huraira, call the Ansar to me. So I called out to them and they came hurriedly. He said: O ye Assembly of the Ansaar, do you see the ruffians of the Quraish? They said: Yes. He said: See, when you meet them tomorrow, wipe them out. He hinted at this with his hand, placing his right hand on his left and said: You will meet us at as-Safa'. (Abu Huraira continued): Whoever was seen by them that day was put to death. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ascended the mount of as-Safa'. The Ansar also came there and surrounded the mount. Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger ot Allah, the Quraish have perished. No member of the Quraish tribe will survive this day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who enters the house of Abu Safyin will be safe, who lays down arms will be safe, who locks his door will be safe. (some of) the Ansar said: (After all) the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. At this, Divine inspiration descended upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: You were saying that the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. Do you know what my name is? I am Muhammad, the bondman of God and His Messenger. (He repeated this thrice.) I left my native place for the take of Allah and joined you. So I will live with you and die with you. Now the Ansar said: By God, we said (that) only out of our greed for Allah and His Messenger. He said: Allah and His Apostle testify to you and accept your apology.
1781.01 | It has been narrated by Ibn Abdullah who said:The Prophet (ﷺ) entered Mecca. There were three hundred and sixty idols around the Ka'ba. He began to thrust them with the stick that was in his hand saying:" Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Lo! falsehood was destined to vanish" (xvii. 8). Truth has arrived, and falsehood can neither create anything from the beginning nor can It restore to life
1781.02 | This tradition has been narrated by Ibn Abu Najah through a different chain of transmitters up to the word:Zahaqa, (This version) does not contain the second verse and substitutes Sanam for Nusub (both the words mean" idol" or" image" that is worshipped).
1782.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Muti' who heard from his father and said:I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say on the day of the Conquest of Mecca: No Quraishite will be killed hound hand and foot from this day until the Day of judgment.
1782.02 | The same tradition has been narrated on the authority of Zakriyya through the same chain of transmitters with the following addition:" No rebellious Quraishite with al-Asi as his name embraced Islam that day except Muti. His name-was al-Asi, but the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) changed his name to Muti.
1783.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of al-Bara' b. 'Azib who said:'Ali b. Abu Talib penned the treaty between the Prophet (ﷺ) and the polytheists on the Day of Hudaibiya. He wrote: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has settled. They (the polytheists) said: Do not write words" the Messenger of Allah". If we knew that you were the Messenger of Allah, we would not fight against you. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to 'Ali: Strike out these words. He (Ali) said: I am not going to strike them out. So the Prophet (ﷺ) struck them out with his own hand. The narrator said that the conditions upon which the two sides had agreed included that the Muslims would enter Mecca (next year) and would stay there for three days, and that they would not enter bearing arms except in their sheaths or bolsters.
1783.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Ishaq, who heard Bars' b. Azib say:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made peace with the people of Hudaibiya, 'Ali drew up the agreement between them, and so he wrote: Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah. (This is followed by the same wording as we have in the previous tradition except the omission of the words: This is what he has settled.)
1783.03 | It has been narrated on the authority of Bara' who said:When the Prophet (ﷺ) was checked from going to the Ka'ba, the people of Mecca made peace with him'on the condition that he would (be allowed to) enter Mecca (next year) and stay there for three days, that he would not enter (the city) except with swords in their sheaths and arms encased in their covers, that he would not take eway with him anyone from its dwellers, nor would he prevent anyone from those with him to stay on in Mecca (if he so desired). He said to 'Ali: Write down the terms settled between us. (So 'Ali wrote): In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful. This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has settled (with the Meccans), The polytheists said to him: If we knew that thou art the Messenger of of Allah, we would follow you. But write: Muhammad b. 'Abdullah. So he told 'Ali to strike out these words. 'Ali said: No, by Allah, I will not strike them out. The Messenger of Allah (may Peace be upon him) said: Show me their place (on the parchment). So he ('Ali) showed him their place and he (the Holy Prophet) struck them out; and 'Ali wrote: Ibn 'Abdullah. (According to the terms of the treaty, next year) the Prophet (ﷺ) stayed there for three days When it was the third day, they said to 'Ali: This is the last day according to the terms of your companion. So tell him to leave. 'Ali informed the Prophet (ﷺ) accordingly. He said: Yes, and left (the city). Ibn Janab in his version of the tradition used:" we would swear allegiance to you" instead of" we would follow you".
1784 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that the Quraish made peace with the Prophet (ﷺ). Among them was Suhail b. Amr. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to 'Ali:Write" In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful." Suhail said: As for" Bismillah," we do not know what is meant by" Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim" (In the name of Allah most Gracious and most Merciful). But write what we understand, i. e. Bi ismika allahumma (in thy name. O Allah). Then, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Write:" From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah." They said: If we knew that thou welt the Messenger of Allah, we would follow you. Therefore, write your name and the name of your father. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Write" From Muhammad b. 'Abdullah." They laid the condition on the Prophet (ﷺ) that anyone who joined them from the Muslims, the Meccans would not return him, and anyone who joined you (the Muslims) from them, you would send him back to them. The Companions said: Messenger of Allah, should we write this? He said: Yes. One who goes away from us to join them-may Allah keep him away! and one who comes to join us from them (and is sent back) Allah will provide him relief and a way of escape.
1785.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Wa'il who said:Sahal b. Hunaif stood up on the Day of Siffin and said: O ye people, blame yourselves (for want of discretion) ; we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the Day of Hudaibiya. If we had thought it fit to fight, we could fight. This was in the truce between the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the polytheists. Umar b. Khattab came, approached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, aren't we fighting for truth and they for falsehood? He replied: By all means. He asked: Are not those killed from our side in Paradise and those killed. from their side in the Fire? He replied: Yes. He said: Then why should we put a blot upon our religion and return, while Allah has not decided the issue between them and ourselves? He said: Son of Khattab, I am the Messenger of Allah. Allah will never ruin me. (The narrator said): Umar went away, but he could not contain himself with rage. So he approached Abu Bakr and said: 'Abu Bakr, aren't we fighting for truth and they for falsehood? He replied: Yes. He asked: Aren't those killed from our side in Paradise and those killed from their side in the Fire? He replied: Why not? He (then) said: Why should we then disgrace our religion and return while God has not yet decided the issue between them and ourselves? Abu Bakr said: Son of Khattab, verily, he is the Messenger of Allah, and Allah will never ruin him. (The narrator continued): At this (a Sura of) the Qur'an (giving glad tidings of the victory) was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He sent for Umar and made him read it. He asked: Is (this truce) a victory? He (the Messenger of Allah) replied: Yes. At this Umar was pleased, and returned.
1785.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Shaqiq who said:I heard Sahl b. Hunaif say at Siffin: O ye people, find fault with your (own) discretion. By Allah, on the Day of Abu Jandal (i. e. the day of Hudaibiya), I thought to myself that, if I could, I would reverse the order of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (the terms of the truce being unpalatable). By Allah, we have never hung our swords on our shoulders in any situation whatsoever except when they made easy for us to realise the goal envisaged by us, but this battle of yours (seems to be an exception). Ibn Numair (in his version) did not mention the words:" In any situation whatsoever"
1785.03 | The same tradition has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters on the authority of A'mash. This version contains the words:Ila amrin yofzi'una instead of Ila amrin na'rifuhu.
1785.04 | It has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters on the authority of Abu Wa'il who said:I heard Sahl b. Hunaif say at Siffin: Blame (the hollowness) of your views about your religion. I thought to myself on the day of Abu Jandal that if I could turn down the order of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would. The situation was so difficult that if we mended it at one place, it was rent at another.
1786.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said:When they (Companions of the Holy Prophet) were overwhelmed with grief and distress on his return from Hudaibiya where he had slaughtered his sacrificial beasts (not being allowed to proceed to Mecca), the Qur'anic verse: Inna fatahna... laka fathan mobinan to fauzan 'aziman, was revealed to him. (At this) he said: On me has descended a verse that is dearer to me than the whole world.
1786.02 | This tradition has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters.
1787 | It has been reported on the authority of Hudbaifa b. al-Yaman who said:Nothing prevented me from being present at! he Battle of Badr except this incident. I came out with my father Husail (to participate in the Battle), but we were caught by the disbelievers of Quraish. They said: (Do) you intend to go to Muhammad? We said: We do not intend to go to him, but we wish to go (back) to Medina. So they took from us a covenant in the name of God that we would turn back to Medina and would not fight on the side of Muhammad (ﷺ). So, we came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and related the incident to him. He said: Both, of you proceed (to Medina) ; we will fulfil the covenant made with them and seek God's help against them.
1788 | It has been narrated by Ibrahim al-Taimi on the authority of his father who said:We were sitting in the company of Hudhaifa. A man said: If I were in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would have fought by his side and would have striven hard for his causes. Hudhaifa said: You might have done that, (but you should not make a flourish of your enthusiasm). I was with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the night of the Battle of Abzib and we were gripped by a violent wind and severe cold. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be him) said: Hark, the man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We all kept quiet and none of us responed to him. (Again) he said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We kept quiet and none of us responded to him. He again said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgtuent by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted) Then he said: Get up Hudhaifa, bring me the news of the enemy. When he called me by name I had no alternative but to get up. He said: Go and bring me information about the enemy, and do nothing that may provoke them against me. When I left him, I felt warm as if I were walking in a heated bath untill I reached them. I saw Abu Sufyan warming his back against fire I put an arrow in the middle of the bow. intending to shoot at him, when I recalled the words of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)" Do not provoke them against me." Had I shot at him, I would have hit him. But I returned and (felt warm as if) I were walking in a heated bath (hammam). Presenting myself before him, I gave him information about the enemy. When I had done so, I began to feel cold, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrapped me in a blanket that he had in excess to his own requirement and with which he used to cover himself while saying his prayers. So I continued to sleep until it was morning. When it was morning he said: Get up, O heavy sleeper.
1789 | It has been reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that (when the enemy got the upper hand) on the day of the Battle of Uhud, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was left with only seven men from the ansar and two men from the Quraish. When the enemy advanced towards him and overwhelmed him, he said:Whoso turns them away from us will attain Paradise or will be my Companion in Paradise. A man from the Ansar came forward and fought (the enemy) until he was killed. The enemy advanced and overwhelmed him again and he repeated the words: Whoso turns them away, from us will attain Paradise or will be my Companion in Paradise. A man from the Arsar came forward and fought until he was killed. This state continued until the seven Ansar were killed (one after the other). Now, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to his two Companions: We have not done justice to our Companions.
1790.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abd-ul-'Aziz b. Abu Hazim, who learnt from his father (Abu Hazim). The latter heard it from Sahl b. Sa'd who was asked about the injury which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got on the day of the Battle of Uhud. He said:The face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was injured, his front teeth were damaged and his helmet was crushed. Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), was washing the blood (from his head), and 'Ali b. Abu Talib was pouring water on it from a shield. When Fatima saw that the bleeding had increased on account of (pouring) water (on the wound), she took a piece of mat and burnt it until it was reduced to ashes. She put the ashes on the wound and the bleeding stopped.
1790.02 | It has been reported on the authority of Abu Hazim who heard from Sahl b. Sa'd. The latter was asked about the injury of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said:By God, I know the person who washed the wound of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), who poured water on it and with what the wound was treated. Then Sahl narrated the same tradition as has been narrated by 'Abd al-'Azlz except that he added the words:" And his face was injured" and replaced the word" Hushimat" by" Kusirat" (i. e. it was broken).
1790.03 | The same tradition has been narrated on the authority of Sahl b. Sa'd through a different chain of transmitters with a slight difference in the wording.
1791 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had his front teeth damaged on the day of the Battle of Uhud, and got a wound on his head. He was wiping the blood (from his face) and was saying:How will these people attain salvation who have wounded their Prophet and broken his tooth while he called them towards God? At this time, God, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed the Verse:" Thou hast no authority" (iii. 127).
1792.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah who said:It appeared to me as if I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (and heard him) relate the story of a Prophet who had been beaten by his people, was wiping the blood from his face and was saying. My Lord, forgive my people, for they do not know.
1792.02 | A version of the tradition with a slightly different wording has been narrated by another chain of transmitters.
1793 | It has been narrated by Hammam b. Munabbih who said:This is what has been related to us by Abu Huraira from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). (With this introduction) he narrated a number of traditions. One of these was that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Great is the wrath of Allah upon a people who have done this to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he was at that time pointing to his front teeth. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) also said: Great is the wrath of Allah upon a person who has been killed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the way of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious.
1794.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Mas'ud who said:While the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was saying his prayer near the Ka'ba and Abu Jahl with his companions was sitting (near by), Abu Jahl said, referring to the she-camel that had been slaughtered the previous day: Who will rise to fetch the foetus of the she-camel of so and so, and place it between the shoulders of Muhammad when he goes down in prostration (a posture in prayer). The one most accursed among the people got up, brought the foetus and, when the Prophet (ﷺ) went down in prostration, placed it between his shoulders. Then they laughed at him and some of them leaned upon the others with laughter. And I stood looking. If I had the power, I would have thrown it away from the back of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Prophet (ﷺ) had bent down his head in prostration and did not raise it, until a man went (to his house) and informed (his daughter) Fatima, who was a young girl (at that time) (about this ugly incident). She came and removed (the filthy thing) from him. Then she turned towards them rebuking them (the mischief-mongers). When the Prophet (ﷺ) had finished his prayer, he invoked God's imprecations upon them in a loud voice. When he prayed, he prayed thrice, and when he asked for God's blessings, he asked thrice. Then he said thrice: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the Quraish. When they heard his voice, laughter vanished from them and they feared his malediction. Then he said: O God, it is for Thee to deal with Abu Jahl b. Hisham, 'Utba b. Rabi'a, Shaiba b. Rabi'a. Walid b. Uqba, Umayya b. Khalaf, Uqba b. Abu Mu'ait (and he mentioned the name of the seventh person. which I did not remember). By One Who sent Muhammad with truth, I saw (all) those he had named lying slain on the Day of Badr. Their dead bodies were dragged to be thrown into a pit near the battlefield. Abu Ishiq had said that the name of Walid b. 'Uqba has been wrongly mentioned in this tradition.
1794.02 | It has been narrated by Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) who said:When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was lying postrate in prayer and around him were some people from the Quraish, 'Uqba b. Abu Mu'ait brought the foetus of a she-camel and threw it on the back of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He did not raise his head until Fatima arrived, removed it from his back and cured him who had done that (ugly act). He said: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the chiefs of the Quraish. Abu Jahl b. Hisham, 'Utba b. Rabi'a. Uqba b. Abu Mu'ait, Shaiba b. Rabi'a, Umayya b. Khalaf or Ubayy b. Khalaf (Shu'ba, one of the narrator of this tradition is in doubt about the exact person). I saw that all were slain in the Battle of Badr and their dead bodies were thrown into a well, except that of Umayya or Ubayy which was cut into pieces and was thrown into the well.
1794.03 | Abu Ishiq has narrated a similar tradition through a different chain of transmitters and has added:He (the Messenger of Allah) loved to repeat the supplication thrice. He was saying: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the Quraish (repeating these words thrice). And among the Quraish, he mentioned (the names of) al-Walid b. 'Utba and Umayya b. Khalaf. (The narrator says there is no doubt about the names of these persons but he has forgotten the name of the seventh man).
1794.04 | It has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah that, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned his face towards the Ka'ba and invoked God's imprecations upon six men of the Quraish, amorig whom were Abu Jahl. Umayya b. Khalaf, Utba b. Rabi'a, Shaiba b. Rabi'a and 'Uqba b. Abu Mu'ait I swear by God that I saw them lying slain in the battlefield of Badr. It being a hot day, their complexion had changed (showing signs of decay).
1795 | It has been narrated on the authority of `A'isha, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), who said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him):Messenger of Allah, has there come upon you a day more terrible than the day of Uhud. He said: I have experienced from thy people and the hardest treatment I met from them was what I received from them on the day of `Aqaba. I betook myself to Ibn `Abd Yalil b. `Abd Kulal with the purpose of inviting him to Islam, but he did not respond to me as I desired. So I departed with signs of (deep) distress on my face. I did not recover until I reached Qarn al-Tha`alib. Where I raised my head, lo! near me was a cloud which had cast its shadow on me. I looked and lo! there was in it the angel Jibril who called out to me and said: God, the Honoured and Glorious, has heard what thy people have said to thee, and how they have reacted to thy call. And He has sent to thee the angel in charge of the mountains so that thou mayest order him what thou wishest (him to do) with regard to them. The angel in charge of the mountains (then) called out to me, greeted me and said: Muhammad, God has listened to what thy people have said to thee. I am the angel in charge of the mountains, and thy Lord has sent me to thee so that thou mayest order me what thou wishest. If thou wishest that I should bring together the two mountains that stand opposite to each other at the extremities of Mecca to crush them in between, (I would do that). But the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said to him: I rather hope that God will produce from their descendants such persons as will worship Allah, the One, and will not ascribe partners to Him.
1796.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Jundub b. Sufyan who said:A finger of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was wounded in one of the encounters He said: Thou art just a little finger which has bled, and what thou hast experienced is in the cause of Allah.
1796.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Aswad b. Qais who said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in a cave (or raid) when his finger was hurt.
1797.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Aswad b. Qais who heard Jundub saying that Gabriel delayed his visit to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) The polytheists began to say that Muhammad has been forsaken. At this Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, revealed:" Wa'dd hd wa'l-laili iza saja, ma wadda'ka Rabbuka wa' ma qala" [By the glorious morning light, and by the night when it is still: thy Lord has not forsaken thee, nor is He displeased].
1797.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Aswad b. Qais who said:I heard Jundub b. Sufyan say: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fell ill and did not wake up for two or three nights (for prayers) A woman came to him and said: Muhammad, I hope that your satan has left you. I haven't seen him approach you for two or three nights. The narrator says: At this, Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, revealed:" By the Glorious......"
1797.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Aswad b. Qais with the same chain of transmitters.
1798.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Usama b. Zaid that the Prophet (ﷺ) rode a donkey. It had on it a saddle under which was a mattress made at Fadak (a place near Medina). Behind him he seated Usama. He was going to the street of Banu Harith al-Khazraj to inquire after the health of Sa'd b. Ubada This happened before the Battle of Badr. (He proceeded) until he passed by a mixed company of people in which were Muslims, polytheists, idol worshippers and the Jews and among them were 'Abdullah b. Ubayy and 'Abdullah b. Rawaha. When the dust raised by the hoofs of the animal spread over the company, 'Abdullah b. Ubayy covered his nose with his mantle and said:Do not scatter the dust over us (Not minding this remark), the Prophet (ﷺ) greeted them, stopped, got down from his animal, invited them to Allah, and recited to them the Qur'an. 'Abdullah b. Ubayy said: O man, if what you say is the truth, the best thing for you would be not to bother us with it in our assemblies. Get back to your place. Whoso comes to you from us, tell him (all) this. Abdullah b. Rawaha said: Come to us in our gatherings, for we love (to hear) it. The narrator says: (At this), the Muslims, the polytheists and the Jews began to rebuke one another until they were determined to come to blows. The Prophet (ﷺ) continued to pacify them. (When they were pacified), he rode his animal and came to Sa'd b. 'Ubida. He said: Sa'd, haven't you heard what Abu Hubab (meaning 'Abdullah b. Ubayy) has said? He has said so and so. Sa'd said: Messenger of Allah, forgive and pardon. God has granted you a sublime position, (but so far as he is concerned) the people of this settlement had-decided to make him their king by making him wear a crown and a turban (in token thereof), but God has circumvented this by the truth He has granted you. This has made him jealous and his jealousy (must have) prompted the behaviour that you have witnessed. So, the Prophet (may peace upon him) forgave him.
1798.02 | A similar tradition has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters by Ibn Shihab with the addition of the words:" Before Abdullah (b. Ubayy) became a Muslim."
1799 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that it was said to the Prophet (ﷺ):Would that you approached Abdullah b. Ubayy (to persuade him to accept Islam). The Prophet (ﷺ) (accordingly) went to him, riding a donkey, and (a party of) Muslims also went (with him). On the way they had to walk over a piece of land affected with salinity. When the Prophet (ﷺ) approached him, he said: Do not come near me. By Allah, the obnoxious smell of your donkey has offended me. (As a rejoinder to this remark), a man from the Ansar said: By God, the smell of the donkey of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is better than your smell. (At this), a man from the tribe of 'Abdullah got furious. Then people from both sides got furious and exchanged blows with sticks, hands and shoes. (The narrator says) that (after this scuffle) we learnt that (the Qur'anic verse):" It two parties of the Believers have a quarrel, make ye peace between them" (xlix. 9) was revealed about these fighting parties.
1800.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said (after the encounter at Badr):Who will ascertain for us what has happened to Abu Jahl? Ibn Mas'ud went (to gather this information). He found that the two sons of 'Afra' had struck him and he lay cold at the point of death. He caught him by his beard and said: Art thou Abu Jahl? He said: is there anybody superior to the person you have killed, or (he said) his people have killed him. Ibn Mas'ud says that, according to Abu Mijlaz, Abu Jahl said: Alas! a person other than a farmer would have killed me.
1800.02 | A similar tradition has been transmitted by a different chain of narrators, on the same authority with a slight difference In the wording.
1801 | It has been narrated on the authority of Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Who will kill Ka'b b. Ashraf? He has maligned Allah, the Exalted, and His Messenger. Muhammad b. Maslama said: Messenger of Allah, do you wish that I should kill him? He said: Yes. He said: Permit me to talk (to him in the way I deem fit). He said: Talk (as you like). So, Muhammad b. Maslama came to Ka'b and talked to him, referred to the old friendship between them and said: This man (i. e. the Holy Prophet) has made up his mind to collect charity (from us) and this has put us to a great hardship. When be heard this, Ka'b said: By God, you will be put to more trouble by him. Muhammad b. Maslama said: No doubt, now we have become his followers and we do not like to forsake him until we see what turn his affairs will take. I want that you should give me a loan. He said: What will you mortgage? He said: What do you want? He said: Pledge me your women. He said: You are the most handsome of the Arabs; should we pledge our women to you? He said: Pledge me your children. He said: The son of one of us may abuse us saying that he was pledged for two wasqs of dates, but we can pledge you (cur) weapons. He said: All right. Then Muhammad b. Maslama promised that he would come to him with Harith, Abu 'Abs b. Jabr and Abbad b. Bishr. So they came and called upon him at night. He came down to them. Sufyan says that all the narrators except 'Amr have stated that his wife said: I hear a voice which sounds like the voice of murder. He said: It is only Muhammad b. Maslama and his foster-brother, Abu Na'ila. When a gentleman is called at night even it to be pierced with a spear, he should respond to the call. Muhammad said to his companions: As he comes down, I will extend my hands towards his head and when I hold him fast, you should do your job. So when he came down and he was holding his cloak under his arm, they said to him: We sense from you a very fine smell. He said: Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most scented of the women of Arabia. He said: Allow me to smell (the scent on your head). He said: Yes, you may smell. So he caught it and smelt. Then he said: Allow me to do so (once again). He then held his head fast and said to his companions: Do your job. And they killed him.
1365.07 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raided Khaibar. One morning we offered prayers in the darkness of early dawn (near Khaibar). Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mounted (his horse). Abu Talha mounted his and I mounted behind Abu Talha on the same horse. The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) rode through the streets of Khaibar and (I rode so close to him) that my knee touched the thigh of the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ). The wrapper got aside from his thigh, and I could see its whiteness. When he entered the town, he said:God is Great. Khaibar shall face destruction. When we descend in the city-square of a people, it is a bad day for them who have been warned (and have not taken heed). He said these words thrice. The people of the town had just come out from (their houses) to go about their jobs. They said (in surprise): Muhammad has come. We captured Khaibar by force.
1365.08 | It has been narrated (through another chain of transmitters) on the authority of the same narrator (i. e. Anas) who said:I was riding behind Abu Talha on the day of the Battle of Khaibar (and we were riding so close to the Prophet that) my foot would touch his We encountered the people at sunrise when they had come out with their axes, spades and strings driving their cattle along. They shouted (in surprise): Muhammad has come along with his force! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Khaibar shall face destruction. Behold! when we descend in the city-square of a people, it is a bad day for those who have been warned (but have not taken heed). Allah, the Glorious and Majestic, inflicted defeat upon them.
1365.09 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Anas b. Malik with a slight variation of words.
1802.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Salama b. al-Akwa' who said:We marched upon Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We journeyed during the night. One of the people said to (my brother) 'Amir b. al-Akwa': Won't you recite to us some of your verses? Amir was a poet. So he began to chant his verses to urge the camels, reciting: O God, if Thou hadst not guided us We would have neither been guided rightly nor practised charity, Nor offered prayers. We wish to lay down our lives for Thee; so forgive Thou our lapses, And keep us steadfast when we encounter (our enemies). Bestow upon us peace and tranquillity. Behold, when with a cry they called upon us to help. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who is this driver (of the camels)? They said: It is 'Amir. He said: God will show mercy to him. A man said: Martyrdom is reserved for him. Messenger of Allah, would that you had allowed us to benefit ourselves from his life. (The narrator says): We reached Khaibar and besieged them, and (we continued the siege) until extreme hunger afflicted us. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Behold, God has conquered it for you. When it was evening of the day on which the city was conquered. the Muslims lit many fires. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What are these fires? And what are they cooking? They said: They are cooking meat. He asked. Which meat? They said: That of domestic asses. He said: Let them throw it away and break the pots (in which it is being cooked). A man said: Or should they throw it away and wash the pots? He said: They may do that. When the people drew themselves up in battle array 'Amir caught hold of his sword that was rather short He drove a Jew before him to strike him with it. (As he struck him), his sword recoiled and struck his own knee, and 'Amir died of the wound. When the people returned (after the conquest of Kliaibar) and he (Salama) had caught hold of my hand, and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that I was silent (and dejected) ; he said: What's the matter with thee? I said to him: My father and my mother be thy ransom, people presume that 'Amir's sacrifice has been in vain. He asked: Who has said that? I said: So and so and Usaid b. Hudair al-Ansari. He said: Who has said that has lied. For him (for 'Amir) there is a double reward. (He indicated this by putting two of his fingers together.) He was a devotee of God and a warrior fighting for His cause. There will be hardly any Arab who can fight as bravely as he did. Qutaiba has differed in a few words.
1802.02 | It has been reported on the authority of Salama b. Akwa' who said:On the day of the Battle of Khaibar my brother fought a fierce fight by the side of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). His sword rebounded and killed him. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon hill) talked about his death and doubted (whether it was martyrdom). (They said): (He is) a man killed by his own weapon, and expressed doubt about his affair. Salama said: When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned from Khaibar, I said: Messenger of Allah, permit me that I may recite to you some rajaz verses. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) permitted him. 'Umar b. Khattab said: I know what you will recite. I recited: By God, if God had guided us not, We would hive neither been guided aright nor practised charity, Nor offered prayers. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What you have said is true, 'I (continued): And descend on us peace and tranquillity And keep us steadfast if we encounter (with our enemies) And the polytheists have rebelled against us. When I finished my rajaz, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who composed these verses? I said: They were composed by my brother. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: May God show mercy to him! I said: By God, some people are reluctant to invoke God's mercy on him (because) they say he is a man who died by his own sword. (Hearing this) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He died as God's devotee and warrior. Ibn Shihab has said: I asked one of the sons of Salama (b. Akwa') about (the death of 'Amir). He related to me a similar tradition except that he said: When I said some people were reluctant invoke God's blessings on him, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be, upon him said: They lied. ('Amir) died as God's devotee and warrior (in the cause of Allah). For him there is a double reward, and he pointed out this by putting his two fingers together.
1803.01 | It has been reported on the authority of Barra' who said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was carrying the earth with us on the Day of Ahzab and the whiteness of his belly had been covered with earth. (While engaged in this toil) he was reciting: By God, if Thou hadst not guided us We would have neither been guided aright nor practised charity, Nor offered prayers. Descend on us peace and tranquillity. Behold I these people (the Meccans) refused to follow us. According to another version, he recited: The chieftains (of the tribes) refused to follow us When they contemplated mischief, we rejected it. And with this (verse) he would raise his voice.
1803.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Ishaq who said:I heard from Bara' a similar tradition except that he said:" These people (the Meccans) rebelled against us."
1804 | It has been reported on the authority of Sahl b. Sa'd who said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us while we were digging the ditch and were carrying the earth on our shoulders. (Seeing our condition), he said: O God, there is no life but the life of the Hereafter. So forgive Thou the Muhajirs and the Ansar.
1805.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:O God, there is no life, but the life of the Hereafter, So forgive Thou the Ansar and the Muhajirs.
1805.02 | According to another version of the tradition, reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) is reported to have said:O God, there is no life but the life of the Hereafter, So grant honour to the Ansar and the Muhajirs.
1805.03 | According to still another version of the tradition narrated by the same authority, and handed down through a different chain of transmitters, it has been reported that they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) were reciting rajaz verses and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was (reciting) with them. And they were chanting:O God, there is no good but the good of the Hereafter. So help Thou the Ansar and the Muhajirs. Shaiban substituted" So forgive Thou" for" So help Thou".
1805.04 | It has been narrated (through a still difterent chain of transmitters) by Anas that the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) were chanting on the day of the Battle of the Ditch:We are those who have sworn allegiance to Muhammad (And made a covenant with him) to follow Islam as long as we live. Hammad is not sure whether Anas said:" Ala'l-Islam" or," Ala'l-Jihad". And the Prophet (ﷺ) was chanting: O God, the real good is the good of the Hereafter, So forgive Thou the Ansar and the Muhajirs.
1806 | It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Abu 'Ubaid who said that he heard Salama b. al-Akwa' say:I went out before the Adhan for the morning prayer had been delivered. The milch she-camels of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) were grazing at Dhu Qarad. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Auf's slave met me and said: The milch she-camels of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had been taken away. I said: Who has taken them away? He said: (the people belonging to the tribe of) Ghatafan. I cried thrice: Help! I made the whole city between the two lavas hear my cry. Then I ran straight in their pursuit until I overtook them at Dhu Qarad where they were just going to water their animals. I, being an archer, began to shoot them with my arrows and was saying: I am the son of al-Akwa'. And today is the day when the cowards will meet their doom. I continued to chant until I rescued the milch she-camels from them, and snatched from them thirty mantles. Now, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and some other people came along. I said: Prophet of Allah, I have prevented them from water while they were thirsty. So you should send a force (to punish them). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ibn al-Akwa', you have taken (what, you have taken). Now let them go. Then we returned and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made me mount behind him on his she-camel until we entered Medina.
1807.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Salama. He heard the tradition from his father who said:We arrived at Hudaibiya with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we were fourteen hundred in number. There were fifty goats for them which could not be watered (by the small quantity of water in the local well). So, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat on the brink of the well. Either he prayed or spat into the well The water welled up. We drank and watered (the beasts as well). Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called us to take the vow of allegiance, as he was sitting at the base of a tree. I was the first man to take the vow. Then other people took the vow. When half the number of people had done so, he said to me: You take the vow, Salama. I said: I was one of those who took the vow in the first instance. He said: (You may do) again. Then the Messenger. of Allah (ﷺ) saw that I was without weapons. He gave me a big or a small shield. Then he continued to administer vows to the people until it was the last batch of them. He said (to me): Won't you swear allegiance, Salama? I said: Messenger of Allah, I took the oath with the first batch of the people and then again when you were in the middle of the people. He said: (Doesn't matter), you may (do so) again. So I took the oath of allegiance thrice. Then he said to me: Salama, where is the shield which I gave to thee? I said: Messenger of Allah, my uncle 'Amir met me and he was without any weapons. So I gave the shield to him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) laughed and said: You are like a person of the days gone by who said: O God. I seek a friend who is dearer to me than myself. (When all Companions had sworn allegiance to the Holy Prophet), the polytheists sent messages of peace, until people could move from our camp to that of the Meccans and vice versa. Finally, the peace treaty was concluded. I was a dependant of Talha b. Ubaidullah. I watered his horse, rubbed its back. I served Talha (doing odd jobs for him) and partook from his food. I had left my family and my property as an emigrant in the cause of Allah and His Messenger (may peace be uron him). When we and the people of Mecca had concluded a peace treaty and the people of one side began to mix with those of the other, I came to a tree, swept away its thorns and lay down (for rest) at its base; (while I lay there), four of the polytheists from the Meccans came to me and began to talk ill of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I got enraged with them and moved to another tree. They hung their weapons (to the branches of the tree) and lay down (for rest). (While they lay there), somebody from the lower part of the valley cried out: Run up, O Muhajirs! Ibn Zunaim has been murdered. I drew my sword and attacked these four while they were asleep. I seized their arms and collected them up in my hand, and said: By the Being Who has conferred honour upon Muhammad, none of you shall raise his head, else I will smite his face. (Then) I came driving them along to the Prophet (ﷺ). (At the same time). my uncle Amir came (to him) with a man from" Abalat called Mikraz. Amir was dragging him on a horse with a thick covering on its back along with seventy polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) cast a glance at them and said: Let them go (so that) they may prove guilty of breach of trust more than once (before we take action against them). So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forgave them. On this occasion. God revealed the Qur'anic verse:" It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had granted you a victory over them" (xlviii. 24). Then we moved returning to Medina, and halted at a place where there was a mountain between us and Banu Lihyan who were polytheists. The Messenaer of Allah (ﷺ) asked God's forgiveness for one who ascended the mountain at night to act as a scout for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Compinions. I ascended (that mountain) twice or thrice that night. (At last) we reached Medina. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent his camels with his slave, Rabah, and I was with him. I (also) went to the pasture with the horse of Talha along with the camels. When the day dawned, Abd al-Rahman al-Fazari made a raid and drove away all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and killed the man who looked after them. I said: Rabah, ride this horse, take it to Talha b. 'Ubaidullah and Inform the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that the polytheists have made away with his camels. Then I stood upon a hillock and turning my face to Medina, shouted thrice: Come to our help I Then I set out in pursuit of the raiders, shooting at them with arrows and chanting a (self-eulogatory) verse in the Iambic metre: I am the son of al-Akwa' And today is the day of defeat for the mean. I would overtake a man from them, shoot at him an arrow which, piercing through the saddle, would reach his shoulder. and I would say: Take it, chanting at the same time the verse And I am the son of al-Akwa' And tody is the day of defeat for the mean. By God, I continued shooting at them and hamstringing their animals. Whenever a horseman turned upon me, I would come to a tree and (hid myself) sitting at its base. Then I would shoot at him and hamstring his horse. (At last) they entered a narrow mountain gorge. I ascended that mountain and held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued to chase them in this way until I got all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) released and no camel was left with them. They left me; then I followed them shooting at them (continually) until they dropped more than thirty mantles and thirty lances. lightening their burden. On everything they dropped, I put a mark with the help of (a piece of) stone so that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions might recognise them (that it was booty left by the enemy). (They went on) until They came to a narrow valley when so and so, son of Badr al-Fazari joined them. They (now) sat down to take their breakfast and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Al-Fazari said: Who is that fellow I am seeing? They said: This fellow has harassed us. By God, he has not left us since dusk and has been (continually) shooting at us until he has snatched everything from our hands. He said: Four of you should make a dash at him (and kill him). (Accordingly), four of them ascended the mountain coming towards me. When it became possible for me to talk to them, I said: Do you recognise me? They said: No. Who are thou? I said: I am Salama, son of al-Akwa'. By the Being Who has honoured the countenance of Muhammad (ﷺ) I can kill any of you I like but none of you will be able to kill me. One of them said: I think (he is right). So they returned. I did not move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), who came riding through the trees. Lo! the foremost among them was Akhram al-Asadi. Behind him was Abu Qatada al-Ansari and behind him was al-Miqdad b. al-Aswad al-Kindi. I caught hold of the rein of Akhram's horse (Seeing this). they (the raiders) fled. I said (to Akhram): Akhram, guard yourself against them until Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his Companions join you. He said: ) Salama, if you believe In Allah and the Day of Judgment and (if) you kaow that Paradise is a reality and Hell is a reality, you should not stand between me and martyrdom. so I let him go. Akhram and Abd al-Rahman (Fazari) met in combat. Akhram hamstrung Abd al-Rahman's horse and the latter struck him with his lance and killed him. Abd al-Rabman turned about riding Akhram's horse. Abu Qatada, a horse-man of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), met 'Abd al-Rahman (in combat), smote him with his lance and killed him. By the Being Who honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace oe upon him), I followed them running on my feet (so fast) that I couldn't see behind me the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ), nor any dust raised by their horses. (I followed them) until before sunset they reached a valley which had a spring of water, which was called Dhu Qarad, so that they could have a drink, for they were thirsty. They saw me running towards them. I turned them out of the valley before they could drink a drop of its water. They left the valley and ran down a slope. I ran (behind them), overtook a man from them, shot him with an arrow through the shoulder blade and said: Take this. I am the son of al-Akwa'; and today is the day of annihilation for the people who are mean. The fellow (who was wounded) said: May his mother weep over him! Are you the Akwa' who has been chasing us since morning? I said: Yes, O enemy of thyself, the same Akwa'. They left two horses dead tired on the hillock and I came dragging them along to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I met 'Amir who had with him a container having milk diluted with water and a container having water. I performed ablution with the water and drank the milk. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while he was at (the spring of) water from which I had driven them away. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had captured those camels and everything else I had captured and all the lances and mantles I had snatched from the polytheists and Bilal had slaughtered a she-camel from the camels I had seized from the people, and was roasting its liver and hump for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I said: Messenger of Allah, let me select from our people one hundred men and I will follow the marauders and I will finish them all so that nobody is left to convey the news (of their destruction to their people). (At these words of mine), the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) laughed so much that his molar teeth could be seen in the light of the fire, and he said: Salama, do you think you can do this? I said: Yes, by the Being Who has honoured you. He said: Now they have reached the land of Ghatafan where they are being feted. (At this time) a man from the Ghatafan came along and said: So and so slaughtered a camel for them. When they were exposing its skin, they saw dust (being raised far off). They said: They (Akwa' and his companions) have come. So. they went away fleeing. When it was morning, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Our best horseman today is Abu Qatada and our best footman today is Salama. Then he gave me two shares of the booty-the share meant for the horseman and the share meant for the footman, and combined both of them for me. Intending to return to Medina, he made me mount behind him on his she-camel named al-Adba'. While we were travelling, a man from the Ansar who could not be beaten in a race said: Is there anyone who could compete (with me) in race to Medina? Is there any competitor? He continued repeating this. When I heard his talk, I said: Don't you show consideration to a dignified person and don't you have awe for a noble man? He said: No, unless he be the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be thy ransom, let me get down so that I may beat this man (in the race). He said: It you wish, (you may). I said (to the man): I am coming to thee, I then turned my feet. sprang up and tan and gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again followed his heel and again gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again dashed until I joined him and gave a blow between his shoulders. I said: You have been overtaken, by God. He said: I think so. Thus, I reached Medina ahead of him. By God, we had stayed there only three nights when we set out to Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). (On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the following rajaz verses for the people: By God, if Thou hadst not guided us aright, We would have neither practised charity nor offered prayers. (O God! ) We cannot do without Thy favours; Keep us steadfast when we encounter the enemy, And descend tranquillity upon us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who is this? 'Amir said: it is 'Amir. He said: May thy God forgive thee! The narrator said: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked forgiveness for a particular person, he was sure to embrace martyrdom. Umar b. Khattab who was riding on his camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to benefit from Amir. Salama continued: When we reached Khaibar, its king named Marhab advanced brandishing his sword and chanting: Khaibar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like) A fully armed, and well-tried warrior. When the war comes spreading its flames. My uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying: Khaibar certainly knows that I am 'Amir, A fully armed veteran who plunges into battles. They exchanged blows. Marbab's sword struck the shield of 'Amir who bent forward to attack his opponent from below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery: in his forearm which caused his death. Salama said: I came out and heard some people among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) saying: Amir's deed has been wasted; he has killed himself. So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah. Amir's deed has been wasted. The Messenger (ﷺ) said: Who passed this remark? I said: Some of your Companions. He said: He who has passed that remark has told a lie, for 'Amir there is a double reward. Then he sent me to 'Ali who had sore eyes, and said: I will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger or whom Allah and His Messenger love. So I went to 'Ali, brought him beading him along and he had sore eyes, and I took him to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), who applied his saliva to his eyes and he got well. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave him the banner (and 'Ali went to meet Marhab in a single combat). The latter advanced chanting: Khaibar knows certainly that I am Marhab, A fully armed and well-tried valorous warrior (hero) When war comes spreading its flames. 'Ali chanted in reply: I am the one whose mother named him Haidar, (And am) like a lion of the forest with a terror-striking countenance. I give my opponents the measure of sandara in exchange for sa' (i. e. return thir attack with one that is much more fierce). The narrator said: 'Ali struck at the head of Mirhab and killed him, so the victory (capture of Khaibar) was due to him. This long tradition has also been handed down Through a different chain of transmitters.
1807.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of 'Ikrama b. Ammar.
1808 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that eighty Persons from the inhabitants of Mecca swooped down upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from the mountain of Tan'im. They were armed and wanted to attack the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions unawares. He (the Holy Prophet) captured them but spared their lives. So, God, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed the verses:" It is He Who restrained your hands from them and their hands from you in the valley of Mecca after He had given you a victory over them."
1809.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that, on the Day of Hunain. Umm Sulaim took out a dagger she had in her possession. Abiu Talha saw her and said:Messenger of Allah, this is Umm Sulaim. She is holding a dagger. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked (her): What for are you holding this dagger? She said: I took it up so that I may tear open the belly of a polytheist who comes near me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to smile (at these words). She said: Messenger of Allah, kill all those people-other than us-whom thou hast declared to be free (on the day of the Conquest of Mecca). (They embraced Islam because) they were defeated at your hands (and as such their Islam is not dependable). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Umm Sulaim. God is sufficient (against the mischief of the polytheists) and He will be kind to us (so you need not carry this dagger).
1810 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) allowed Umm Sulaim and some other women of the Ansar to accompany him when he went to war; they would give water (to the soldiers) and would treat the wounded.
1811 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said:On the Day of Uhud some of the people, being defeated, left the Prophet (ﷺ), but Abu Talha stood before him covering him with a shield. Abu Talha was a powerful archer who broke two or three bows that day. When a man would pass by carrying a quiver containing arrows, he would say: Spare them for Abu Talha. Whenever the Prophet (ﷺ) raised his head to look at the people, Abu Talha would say: Prophet of Allah, may my father and my mother be thy ransom, do not raise your head lest you be struck by an arrow shot by the enemy. My neck is before your neck. The narrator said: I saw `A'isha bint Abu Bakr and Umm Sulaim. Both of them had tucked up their garments, so I could see the anklets on their feet. They were carrying water-skins on their backs and would pour water into the mouths of the people. They would then go back (to the well), would fill them again and would return to pour water into the mouths of the soldiers. (On this day), Abu Talha's sword dropped down from his hands twice or thrice because of drowsiness.
1812.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Hurmuz that Najda wrote to Ibn Abbas inquiring of him five things. Ibn Abbas said:If I had not the fear of committing (sin) for concealing the knowledge I would not have written to him. Najda wrote to him saying (after praising the Almighty and invoking blessings on the Prophet): Tell me whether the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took women to participate with him in Jihad; (if he did), whether he allotted them a regular share from the booty; whether he killed the children of (the enemy in the war), how long an orphan would be entitled to consideration as such, and for whom the Khums (fifth part of the booty) was booty. Ibn Abbas wrote to him: You have written asking me whether the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took women with him to participate in Jihad. He did take them to the battle and sometimes he fought along with them. They would treat the wounded and were given a reward from the booty, but he did not assign any regular share for them. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not kill the children of the enemy, so you should not kill the children. Also you have written to me asking me when the orphanhood of an orphan comes to an end. By my life, if a man has become bearded but is still incapable of getting his due from others or fulfilling his obligation towards them, (he is yet an orphan to be treated as such), but when he can look after his interests like grown-up people, he is no longer an orphan. And you have written to me inquiring about Khums as to whom it is meant for. (In this connection) we (the kinsmen of the Messenger of Allah) used to say: It is for us, but those people (i.e. Banu Umayya) have denied it to us.
1812.02 | This tradition has been narrated by the game authority (Yazid b. Hurmus) through a different chain of transmitters with the following difference in the elucidation of one of the points raised by Najda in his letter to Ibn Abas:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used not to kill the children, so thou shouldst not kill them unless you could know what Khadir had known about the child he killed, or you could distinguish between a child who would grow up to he a believer (and a child who would grow up to be a non-believer), so that you killed the (prospective) non-believer and left the (prospective) believer aside.
1812.03 | It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Hurmuz who said:Najda b. 'Amir al-Haruri wrote to Ibn Abbas asking him about the slave and the woman as to whether they would get a share from the booty (it they participated in Jihad) ; about the killing of (enemy) children (in war) ; about the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to an end; about kinsmen (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. He said to Yazid: Write to him. (If he were not likely to fall into folly, I would not have written to him.) Write: You have written asking about the woman and the slave whether they would get a share of the booty if they participated in Jihad. (You should know that) there is nothing of the sort for them except that they will be given a prize. And you have written asking me about the killing of the enemy children in war. (You should understand that) the Messenger of Allah (may peare be upon him) did not kill them. and thou shouldst not kill them unless thou knew what the companion of Moses (i. e. Khadir) knew about the boy he had killed. And you have written asking me about the orphan as to when the period of his orphanhood comes to an end, so that the sobriquet of" orphan" is dropped from him. (In this regard, you should know that) the sobriquet" orphan" will not be dropped from him until he attains maturity of body and mind. And you have written asking me about the close relatives (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. We think that it is we, but our people have denied us this (position and its concomitant privileges).
1812.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Hurmuz through another chain of transmitters.
1812.05 | It has been narrated on the anthority of Yazid b. Hurmuz who said:Najda wrote to Ibn Abbas. I was sitting in the company of Ibn 'Abbas when he read his letter and wrote its reply. Ibn Abbas said: Were it not for preventing him from falling into wickedness. I would not have replied to his letter, may he never be joyful. He wrote in reply to him referring to the share of the close relatives (of the Holy Prophet) (from the booty) whom God has mentioned. (I have to tell you that) we thought we were the close relatives of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but our people have refused to recognise us as such. You have asked about the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to an end. (I have to say that) when he reaches the age of marriage, attains maturity of mind, and his property is returned to him, then he is no longer an orphan. You have inquired whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upo him) used to kill anyone from the children of the polytheists in the war. (You should know that) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used not to kill any one of their children, and you (too) should not kill any one of them, except when you knew about them what Khadir had known about the boy whom he killed. And you have inquired whether there is a fixed share of the booty for women and slaves when they participate in a battle. (I have to tell you that) there is no fixed share for them except that they will be given some reward from the spoils of war.

We covered our feet with rags. so this expedition was called Dhat-ur-Riqa' (i. e. the expedition of rags) because we bandaged our feet with rags (on that day). Abu Burda said: Abu Musa narrated this tradition, and then disliked repeating it as he did not want to give any publicity to what he did in a noble cause Abu Usama said: Narrators other than Abu Buraida have added to the version of the words:" God will reward it."

When he reached Harrat-ul-Wabara (a place four miles from Medina) a man met him who was known for his valour and courage. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) were pleased to see him. He said: I have come so that I may follow you and get a share from the booty. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: Do you believe in Allah and His Apostle? He said: No. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Go back, I will not seek help from a Mushrik (polytheist). He went on until we reached Shajara, where the man met him again. He asked him the same question again and the man gave him the same answer. He said: Go back. Im will not seek help from a Mushrik. The man returned and overtook him at Baida'?

He said: I am hopeful (of God's mercy) as well as afraid (of His wrath) People said: Appoint anyone as your successor. He said: Should I carry the burden of conducting your affairs in my life as well as in my death? (So far as Caliphate is concerned) I wish I could acquit myself (before the Almighty) in a way that there is neither anything to my credit nor anything to my discredit. If I would appoint my successor, (I would because) one better than me did so. (He meant Abu Bakr.) If I would leave You alone, (I would do so because) one better than me, i. e. the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), did so.

I kept quiet until the next morning, still I did not talk to him, and I felt as if I were carryint, a mountain on my right hand. At last I came to him and entered his apartment. (Seeing me) he began to ask me about the condition of the people, and I informed him (about them). Then I said to him: I heard something from the people and took an oath that I will communicate it to you. They presume that you are not going to nominate a successor. If a grazer of camels and sheep that you had appointed comes back to you leaving the cattle, you will (certainly) think that the cattle are lost. To look after the people is more serious and grave. (The dying Caliph) was moved at my words. He bent his head in a thoughtful mood for some time and raised it to me and said: God will doubtlessly protect His religion. If I do not nominate a successor (I have a precedent before me), for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not nominate his successor. And if I nominate one (I have a precedent), for Abu Bakr did nominate. The narrator (Ibn Umar) said: By God. when he mentioned the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr, I (at once) understood that he would not place anyone at a par with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and would not nominate anyone.

He said (to me): Abu Musa (or 'Abdullah b. Qais), what do you say (about the request they have made)? I said: By God Who sent thee on thy mission with truth, they did not disclose to me what they had in their minds, and I did not know that they would ask for a position. The narrator says (while recalling this hadith): I visualise as if I were looking at the miswak of the Prophet (ﷺ) between his lips. He (the Holy Prophet) said: We shall not or shall never appoint to the public offices (in our State) those who with to have them, but you may go, Abu Musa (or Abdullah b. Qais) (to take up your assignment). He sent him to Yemen as governor. then he sent Mu'adh b. jabal in his wake (to help him in the discharge of duties). When Mu'adh reached the camp of Abu Musa, the latter (received him and) said: Please get yourself down; and he spread for him a mattress, while there was a man bound hand and foot as a prisoner. Mu'adh said: Who is this? Abu Musa said: He was a Jew. He embraced Islam. Then he reverted to his false religion and became a Jew. Mu'adh said: I won't sit until he is killed according to the decree of Allah and His Apostle (ﷺ) (in this case). Abu Musa said: Be seated. It will be done. He said: I won't sit unless he is killed in accordance with the decree of Allah and His Apostle (ﷺ). He repeated these words thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered him (to be killed) and he was kilied. Then the two talked of standing in prayer at night. One of them, i. e. Mu'adh, said: I sleep (for a part of the night) and stand in prayer (for a part) and I hope that I shall get the same reward for steeping as I shall get for standing (in prayer).

'Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Behold! the Dispensers of justice will be seated on the pulpits of light beside God, on the right side of the Merciful, Exalted and GlorioUS.

I said: I am from the people of Egypt. She said: What was the behaviour of your governor towards you in this war of yours? I said: We did not experience anything bad from him. If the camel of a man from us died, he would bestow on him a camel. If any one of us lost his slave, he would give him a slave. If anybody was in need of the basic necessities of life, he would provide them with provisions. She said: Behold! the treatment that was meted out to my brother, Muhammad b. Abu Bakr, does not prevent me from telling you what I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

I shouldn't find that any of you should come on the Day of Judgment with a bleating ewe mounted on his neck, and he should say to me:" Messenger of Allah, help me," and I should say: I have no authority to help you; I conveyed to you. I shouldn't find that one of you should come on the Day of Judgment with a Person crying loudly mounted on his neck, and he should say to me:" Messenger of Allah, help me," and I should say: I have no authority to help you; I conveyed to you. I shouldn't find that any one of you should come on the Day of Judgment with fluttering clothes wrapped round his neck and he should say to me:" Messenger of Allah, help me," and I should say: I have no authority to help you; I conveyed to you. I shouldn't find that any of you should come on the Day of Judgment with a heap of gold and silver placed on his neck and he should say to me:" Messenger of Allah, help me." and I should say: I have no authority to help you; I already conveyed to you (the warning from the Almighty).

Why didn't he remain in the house of his father or the house of his mother so that he could observe whether gifts were presented to him or not. By the Being in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, any one of you will not take anything from it but will bring it on the Day of Judgment, carrying on his neck a camel that will be growling, or a cow that will be bellowing or an ewe that will be bleating.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You should have remained in the house of your father and your mother, until your gift came to you if you spoke the truth; then he addressed us. He praised God and extolled Him, and afterwards said: I appoint a man from you to a responsible post sharing with him authority that God has entrusted to me, and he comes to me saying: This wealth is for you (i.e. for the public treasury) and this is a gift presented to me. Why did he not remain in the house of his father and his mother and his gift came to him, if he was truthful? By God, any one of you will not take anything from (the public funds) without any justification, but will meet his Lord carrying it on himself on the Day of judgment. I will recognise any one of you meeting Allah and carrying a growling camel, or a cow bellowing or a goat bleating. Then he raised his hands so high that whiteness of his armpits could be seen. Then he said: O my Lord, I have conveyed (Thy Commandments). The narrator says: My eyes saw (the Prophet standing in that pose) and my ears heard (what he said).

'Amira al-Kindi who said:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Whosoever from you is appointed by us to a position of authority and he conceals from us a needle or something smaller than that, it would be misappropriation (of public funds) and will (have to) produce it on the Day of Judgment. The narrator says: A dark-complexioned man from the Ansar stood up - I can visualise him still - and said: Messenger of Allah, take back from me your assignment. He said: What has happened to you? The man said: I have heard you say so and so. He said: I say that (even) now: Whosoever from you is appointed by us to a position of authority, he should bring everything, big or small, and whatever he is given therefrom he should take, and he should restrain himself from taking that which is forbidden.

(Now) Abdullah said: I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey. We halted at a place. Some of us began to set right their tents, others began to compete with one another in shooting, and others began to graze their beasts, when an announcer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) announced that the people should gather together for prayer, so we gathered around the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: It was the duty of every Prophet that has gone before me to guide his followers to what he knew was good for them and warn them against what he knew was bad for them; but this Umma of yours has its days of peace and (security) in the beginning of its career, and in the last phase of its existence it will be afflicted with trials and with things disagreeable to you. (In this phase of the Umma), there will be tremendous trials one after the other, each making the previous one dwindle into insignificance. When they would be afflicted with a trial, the believer would say: This is going to bring about my destruction. When at (the trial) is over, they would be afflicted with another trial, and the believer would say: This surely is going to be my end. Whoever wishes to be delivered from the fire and enter the garden should die with faith in Allah and the Last Day and should treat the people as he wishes to be treated by them. He who swears allegiance to a Caliph should give him the piedge of his hand and the sincerity of his heart (i. e. submit to him both outwardly as well as inwardly). He should obey him to the best of his capacity. It another man comes forward (as a claimant to Caliphate), disputing his authority, they (the Muslims) should behead the latter. The narrator says: I came close to him ('Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As) and said to him: Can you say on oath that you heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He pointed with his hands to his ears and his heart and said: My ears heard it and my mind retained it. I said to him: This cousin of yours, Mu'awiya, orders us to unjustly consume our wealth among ourselves and to kill one another, while Allah says:" O ye who believe, do not consume your wealth among yourselves unjustly, unless it be trade based on mutual agreement, and do not kill yourselves. Verily, God is Merciful to you" (iv. 29). The narrator says that (hearing this) Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-As kept quiet for a while and then said: Obey him in so far as he is obedient to God; and diqobey him in matters involving disobedience to God.

Then he asked again-it was the second time or the third time-when Ash'ath b. Qais (finding that the Prophet was unnecessarily being pressed for answer) pulled him aside and said: Listen to them and obey them, for on them shall he their burden and on you shall be your burden.

I asked: Will there be a good time again after that bad time? He said: Yes, but therein will be a hidden evil. I asked: What will be the evil hidden therein? He said: (That time will witness the rise of) the people who will adopt ways other than mine and seek guidance other than mine. You will know good points as well as bad points. I asked: Will there be a bad time after this good one? He said: Yes. (A time will come) when there will be people standing and inviting at the gates of Hell. Whoso responds to their call they will throw them into the fire. I said: Messenger of Allah, describe them for us. He said: All right. They will be a people having the same complexion as ours and speaking our language. I said: Messenger of Allah, what do you suggest if I happen to live in that time? He said: You should stick to the main body of the Muslims and their leader. I said: If they have no (such thing as the) main body and have no leader?

Islamic period) through which we are now living Will there be a bad time after this good time? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. I said: Will there be a good time after this bad time? He said: Yes. I said: Will there be a bad time after good time? He said: Yes. I said: How? Whereupon he said: There will be leaders who will not be led by my guidance and who will not adopt my ways? There will be among them men who will have the hearts of devils in the bodies of human beings. I said: What should I do. Messenger of Allah, if I (happen) to live in that time? He replied: You will listen to the Amir and carry out his orders; even if your back is flogged and your wealth is snatched, you should listen and obey.

I have come to you to tell you a tradition I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I heard him say: One who withdraws his band from obedience (to the Amir) will find no argument (in his defence) when he stands before Allah on the Day of Judgment, and one who dies without having bound himself by an oath of allegiance (to an Amir) will die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahillyya.
1851.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Umar that he visited Ibn Muti', and related from the Prophet (ﷺ) the tradition that has gone before.
1851.03 | The same tradition has been transmitted by a different chain of narrators.
1852.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of 'Arfaja who said:I have heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Different evils will make their appearance in the near future. Anyone who tries to disrupt the affairs of this Umma while they are united you should strike him with the sword whoever he be. (If remonstrance does not prevail with him and he does not desist from his disruptive activities, he is to be killed.)
1852.02 | In another version of the tradition narrated on the same authority through a different chains of transmitters we have the words:" Kill him."
1852.03 | It has been narrated (through a still different chain of transmitters) on the Same authority (i. e. 'Arfaja) who said similarly-but adding:" Kill all of them." I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: When you are holding to one single man as your leader, you should kill who seeks to undermine your solidarity or disrupt your unity.
1853 | It has been narrated on the authority of Aba Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:When oath of allegiance has been taken for two caliphs, kill the one for whom the oath was taken later.
1854.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Umm Salama that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:In the near future there will be Amirs and you will like their good deeds and dislike their bad deeds. One who sees through their bad deeds (and tries to prevent their repetition by his band or through his speech), is absolved from blame, but one who hates their bad deeds (in the heart of his heart, being unable to prevent their recurrence by his hand or his tongue), is (also) fafe ( so far as God's wrath is concerned). But one who approves of their bad deeds and imitates them is spiritually ruined. People asked (the Holy Prophet): Shouldn't we fight against them? He replied: No, as long as they say their prayers.
1854.02 | It has been narrated (through a different chain of tmnamitters) on the authority of Umm Salama (wife of the Holy Prophet) that he said:Amirs will be appointed over you, and you will find them doing good as well as bad deeds. One who hates their bad deeds is absolved from blame. One who disapproves of their bad deeds is (also) safe (so far as Divine wrath is concerned). But one who approves of their bad deeds and imitates them (is doomed). People asked: Messenger of Allah, shouldn't we fight against them? He replied: No, as long as they say their prayer. (" Hating and disapproving" refers to liking and disliking from the heart.)
1854.03 | Another version of the tradition narrated on the same authority attributes the same words to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) except that it replaces kariha with ankhara and vice versa.
1854.04 | Another version omits a portion at the end of the tradition-a portion which begins with man radiya wa taba and ends with the last word of the tradition.
1855.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of 'Auf b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:The best of your rulers are those whom you love and who love you, who invoke God's blessings upon you and you invoke His blessings upon them. And the worst of your rulers are those whom you hate and who hate you and whom you curse and who curse you. It was asked (by those present): Shouldn't we overthrow them with the help of the sword? He said: No, as long as they establish prayer among you. If you then find anything detestable in them. You should hate their administration, but do not withdraw yourselves from their obedience.
1855.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Auf b. Malik al-Ashja'i who said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say:The best of your rulers are those whom you love and who love you, upon whom you invoke God's blessings and who invoke His blessing upon you. And the worst of your rulers are those whom you hate and who hate you, who curse you and whom you curse. (Those present) said: Shouldn't we overthrow them at this? He said: No, as long as they establish prayer among you. No, as long as they establish prayer among you. Mind you! One who has a governor appointed over him and he finds that the governor indulges in an act of disobedience to God, he should condemn the governor's act, in disobedience to God, but should not withdraw himself from his obedience. Ibn Jabir said: Ruzaiq narrated to me this hadith. I asked him: Abu Miqdam, have you heard it from Muslim b. Qaraza or did he describe it to you and he heard it from 'Auf (b. Malik) and he transmitted this tradition of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? Upon this Ruzaiq sat upon his knees and facing the Qibla said: By Allah, besides Whom there is no other God, I heard it from Muslim b. Qaraza and he said that te had heard it from Auf (b. Malik) and he said that he had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

Ibn Juraij said that he was informed by Abu Zabair who heard Jabir b. Abdullah say: The Prophet (ﷺ) prayed over the well at Hudaibiya (as a result of which its scanty water rose up and increased so as to be sufficient for the 1400 or 1500 men who had encamped at the place).

1863.01 | It has been reported on the authority of Mujashi' b. Mas'ud as-Sulami who said:I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) to offer him my pledge of migration.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Go on doing good deeds (across the seas), for surely God will not leave any of your deeds unrewarded.
1865.02 | This tradition has been handed down through a different chain of transmitter with the addition of the following words at the end:" Do you milk them on the day they arrive at the water? He replied: Yes."
1866.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ).

Whoso from the believing women accepted these conditions and agreed to abide by them were considered to have offered themselves for swearing fealty. When they had (formally) declared their resolve to do so, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) would say to them: You may go. I have confirmed your fealty. By God, the hand of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never touched the hand of a woman. He would take the oath of fealty from them by oral declaration. By God, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never took any vow from women except that which God had ordered him to take, and his palm never touched the palm of a woman.

'Abd al-'Aziz who was then Caliph, and narrated this tradition to him. He said: Surely, this is the demarcation between a minor and a major. So he wrote to his governors that they should pay subsistence allowance to one who was fifteen years old, but should treat those of lesser age among children.

If a person gets wounded in the way of Allah, he will come on the Day of Judgment with his wound in the same condition as it was when it was first inflicted; its colour being the colour of blood but its smell will be the smell of musk. By, the Being in Whose Hand is Muhammad's life, if it were not to be too hard upon the Muslime. I would not lag behind any expedition which is going to fight in the cause of Allah. But I do not have abundant means to provide them (the Mujahids) with riding beasts, nor have they (i. e. all of them) abundant means (to provide themselves with all the means of Jihad) so that they could he left behind.

Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:" Nobody who dies and has something good for him with Allah will (ever like to) return to this world even though he were offered the whole world and all that is in its (as an inducement), except the martyr who desires to return and be killed in the world for the (great) merit of martyrdom that he has seen.

When the question was asked for the third time, he said: One who goes out for Jihad is like a person who keeps fasts, stands in prayer (constantly), (obeying) Allah's (behests contained in) the verses (of the Qur'an), and does not exhibit any lassitude in fasting and prayer until the Mujahid returns from Jihad in the way of Allah, the Exalted.

Another said: Jihad in the way of Allah is better than what you have said. 'Umar reprimanded them and said: Don't raise your voices near the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on Friday. When prayer was over, I entered (the apartment of the Holy Prophet) and asked his verdict about the matter in which they had differed. (It was upon this that) Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, revealed the Qur'anic verse:" Do you make the giving of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to (the service of those) who believe in Allah and the Last Day and strive hard in the cause of Allah. They are not equal in the sight of God. And Allah guides not the wrongdoing people" (ix. 20).

He (Abu Sa`id) wondered at it and said: Messenger of Allah, repeat it for me. He (the Messenger of Allah) did that and said: There is another act which elevates the position of a man in Paradise to a grade one hundred (higher), and the elevation between one grade and the other is equal to the height of the heaven from the earth.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Yes, in case you are killed in the way of Allah and you were patient and sincere and you always fought facing the enemy, never turming your back upon him. Then he added: What have you said (now)? (Wishing to have further assurance from him for his satisfaction), he asked (again): Do you think if I am killed in the way of Allah, all my sins will be obliterated from me? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Yes, it you were patient and sincere and always fought facing the enemy and never turning your back upon him, (all your lapses would be forgiven) except debt. Gabriel has told me this.
1885.02 | The tradition has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters on the authority of Abu Qatada who said:A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while he was on the pulpit and said: Do you think if I am killed in the way of Allah...

1885.03 | Another version of the tradition differently transmitted begins with the words:" A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was sitting on the pulpit.... He said: What do you find if I strike with the sword?" (The rest of the tradition is the same as the previous one.)

Nay, they are alive, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord.." (iii. 169). He said: We asked the meaning of the verse (from the Holy Prophet) who said: The souls, of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds who have their nests in chandeliers hung from the throne of the Almighty. They eat the fruits of Paradise from wherever they like and then nestle in these chandeliers. Once their Lord cast a glance at them and said: Do ye want anything? They said: What more shall we desire? We eat the fruit of Paradise from wherever we like. Their Lord asked them the same question thrice. When they saw that they will continue to be asked and not left (without answering the question). they said: O Lord, we wish that Thou mayest return our souls to our bodies so that we may be slain in Thy way once again. When He (Allah) saw that they had no need, they were left (to their joy in heaven).
1888.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Sa'id Khudri that a man came to the Prophet (may peace he upon him) and said:Who is the best of men? He replied: A man who fights in the way of Allah spending his wealth and staking his life. The man then asked: Who is next to him (in excellence)? He said: Next to him is a believer who lives in a mountain gorge worshipping hid Lord and sparing men from his mischief.
1888.02 | It has been narrated (through a diferent chain of transmetters) on the same authority (i. e. Abu Sa'id Khadri) who said:A man asked: Messenger of Allah, which of men is the best?

He said: Next to him is a man who lives an isolated life in a mountain gorge, worshipping his Lord and sparing men from his mischief.
1888.03 | A version of the tradition narrated on the authority of Ibn Shihab has a little differently worded ending. i. e." A man in a mountain valley." but did not mention" next to him a man who...."
1889.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Of the men he lives the best life who holds the reins of his horse (ever ready to march) in the way of Allah, flies on its back whenever he hears a fearful shriek, or a call for help, flies to it seeking death at places where it can be expected. (Next to him) is a man who lives with his sheep at a hill-top or in a valley, says his prayers regularly, gives Zakat and worships his Lord until death comes to him. There is no better person among men except these two.
1889.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Huraira with a slight variation of wording.
1889.03 | Two more versions of the tradition narrated by 'Abdullah b. Badr and Abu Huraira, respectively, have been handed down through different chains of transmitters with negligible difference in the wording.
1890.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:God laughs at the two men both of whom will enter Paradise (though) one of them kills the other. They said: Messenger of Allah, how is it? He said: One of them fights in the way of Allah, the Almighty and Exalted. and dies a martyr. Then God turns in mercy to the murderer who embraces Islam, fights in the way of Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, and dies a martyr.
1890.02 | The same tradition has been narrated on the authority of Abu Zinad (with the same chain of transmitters).
1890.03 | It has been reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:God laughs at the two men one of whom kills the other; both of them will enter Paradise. They (the Companions) said: How, Messenger of Allah? He said: One is slain (in the way of Allah) and enters Paradise. Then God forgives the other and guides him to Islam; then he fights in the way of Allah and dies a martyr.

1892.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari who said A man brought a muzzled she-camel and said:It is (offered) in the way of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: For this you will have seven hundred she-camels on the Day of Judgment all of which will be muzzled.
1892.02 | A similar tradition has been narrated on the authority of al-A'mash.
1893.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari who said:A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: My riding beast has been killed, so give me some animal to ride upon. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have none with me. A man said: Messenger of Allah, I can guide him to one who will provide him with a riding beast. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: One who guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer.
1893.02 | The above tradition has been handed down through a different chain of transmitters.
1894 | It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that a young man from Aslam tribe said:Messenger of Allah, I wish to fight (in the way of Allah) but I don't have anything to equip myself with for fighting. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Go to so and so, for he had equipped himself (for fighting) but he fell ill. So, he (the young man) went to him and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sends you his greetings and says that you should give me the equipage that you have provided yourself with. The man said (to his wife or maidservant): So and so, give him the equipage I have collected for myself and do not withhold anything from him. Do not withhold anything from him so that you may be blessed therein.
1895.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Zaid b. Khalid al-Juhani that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Anybody who equips a warrior (going to fight) in the way of Allah (is like one who actually) fights. And anybody who looks well after his family in his absence (is also like one who actually) fights.
1895.02 | The above tradition has been narrated on the authority of Khalid al- Juhani who said:The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who equips a warrior in the way of Allah (is like one who dctually fights) aud he who looks after the family of a warrior in the way of Allah in fact participated in the battle.
1896.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Sa'id Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent a force to Banu Lihyan (who are from Banu Hudhail, and said:One man from every two and the reward (will be divided) between the two.

1896.04 | It has been narrated (through a still different chain of transmitters) on the authority of Abu Sa'id Khudrl that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) despatched a force to Banu Lihyan.

1897.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Sulaimin b. Buraida who learnt the tradition from his father. The latter said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:The sanctity of the wives of Mujahids is like the sanctity of their mothers for those who sit at home (i. e do not go out for Jihad). Anyone who stays behind looking after the family of a Mujahid and betrays his trust will be made to stand on the Day of judgment before the Mujahid who will take away from his meritorious deeds whatever he likes. So what do you think (will he leave anything)?
1897.02 | This tradition has been narrated by the same authority through different chain of transmitters.
1897.03 | A version of the tradition narrated on the authority of 'Alqama b. Murthad has a differently worded end:It will be said to the Mujahid: Take from his noble deeds whatever you like. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned to us and asked: What do you think (will he leave anything)? - (i. e. he will take away everything).
1898.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Ishaq, that he heard Bara' talking about the Qur'anic verse:" Those who sit (at home) from among the believers and those who go out for Jihad in the way of Allah are not aqual" (iv. 95). (He said that) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered Zaid (to write the verse). He brought a shoulder-blade (of a slaughtered camel) and inscribed it (the verse) thereon. The son of Umm Maktum complained of his blindness to the Prophet (ﷺ). (At this) descended the revelation:" Those of the believers who sit (at home) without any trouble (illness, incapacity, disability)" (iv. 95). The tradition has been handed down through two other chains of transmitters.
1898.02 | It has been narrated on the authority of Bara' who said:When the Qur'anic verse:" Those who sit (at home) from among mu'min" (iv. 94) was revealed, the son of Umm Maktum spoke to him (the Holy Prophet). (At this). the words:" other than those who have a trouble (illness)" were revealed.
1899 | It has been reported on the authority of Jabir that a man said:Messenger of Allah, where shall I be if I am killed? He replied: In Paradise. The man threw away the dates he had in his hand and fought until he was killed (i. e. he did not wait until he could finish the dates). In the version of the tradition narrated by Suwaid we have the words:" A man said to the Prophet (ﷺ). on the day of Uhud......"
1900 | It has been reported on the authority of Bara! ' who stated:A man from Banu Nabit (one of the Ansar tribes) came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I testify that there is no god except Allah and that thou art His bondman and Messenger. Then he went forward and fought until he was killed. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He has done a little but shall be given a great reward.
1901 | It has been reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent Busaisah as a scout to see what the caravan of Abu Sufyan was doing. He came (back and met the Prophet in his house) where there was nobody except myself and the Messenger of Allah. I do not remember whether he (Hadrat Anas) made an exception of some wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) or not and told him the news of the caravan. (Having heard the news), the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out (hurriedly), spoke to the people and said: We are in need (of men) ; whoever has an animal to ride upon ready with him should ride with us. People began to ask him permission for bringing their riding animals which were grazing on the hillocks near Medina. He said: No. (I want) only those who have their riding animals ready. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions proceeded towards Badr and reached there forestalling the polytheists (of Mecca). When the polytheists (also) reached there, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: None of you should step forward to (do) anything unless I am ahead of him. The polytheists (now) advanced (towards us), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said. Get up to enter Paradise which is equal in width to the heavens and the earth. 'Umair b. al- Humam al-Ansari said: Messenger of Allah, is Paradise equal in extent to the heavens and the earth? He said: Yes. 'Umair said: My goodness! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked him: What prompted you to utter these words (i. e. my goodness! ')? He said: Messenger of Allah, nothing but the desire that I be among its residents. He said: Thou art (surely) amona its residents. He took out dates from his bag and began to eat them. Then he said: If I were to live until I have eaten all these dates of mine, it would be a long life. (The narrator said): He threw away all the dates he had with him. Then he fought the enemies until he was killed.
1902 | The tradition has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Qais. He heard it from his father who, while facing the enemy, reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Surely, the gates of Paradise are under the shadows of the swords. A man in a shabby condition got up and said; Abu Musa, did you hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say this? He said: Yes. (The narrator said): He returned to his friends and said: I greet you (a farewell greeting). Then he broke the sheath of his sword, threw it away, advanced with his (naked) sword towards the enemy and fought (them) with it until he was slain.
677.11 | It has been reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that some people came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said to him:Send with us some men who may teach us the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Accordingjy, he sent seventy men from the Ansar. They were called the Reciters and among them was my maternal uncle. Haram. They used to recite the Qur'an, discuss and ponder over its meaning at night. In the day they brought water and poured it (in pitchers) in the mosque, collected wood and sold it, and with the sale proceeds bought food for the people of the Suffa and the needy. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent the Reciters with these people, but these (treacherous people) fell upon them and killed thern before they reached their destination (While dying), they said: O Allah, convey from us the news to our Prophet that we have met Thee (in a way) that we are pleased with Thee and Thou art pleased with us. (The narrator said): A man attacked Haram (maternal uncle of Anas) ) from behind and smote him with a spear which pierced him. (While dying), Haram said: By the Lord of the Ka'ba, I have met with success. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to his Companions: Your brethren have been slain grid they were saying: O Allah, convey from us to our Prophet the news that we have met Thee in a way that we are pleased with Thee and Thou art pleased with us.
1903 | It has been Deported on the authority of Anas who said:My uncle and I have been named after him was not present with the Messenger of Allah (mav peace be upon him) on the Day of Badr. He felt distressed about it. He would say: I have missed the first battle fought by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and if God now gives me an opportunity to see a battlefield with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), God will see what I do therein. He was afraid to say more than this (lest he be unable to keep his word with God). He was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the Day of Uhud. He met Sa'd b. Mu'adh (who was retreating). Anas said to him: O Abu 'Amr, where (are you going)? Woe (to thee)! I find the smell of Paradise beside the Uhud mountain. (Reprimanding Sa'd in these words) he went forward and fought thein (the enemy) until he was killed. (The narrator says). More than eighty wounds inflicted with swords, spears and arrows were found on his body. His sister, my aunt, ar-Rubayyi', daughter of Nadr, said: I could not recognise my brother's body (it was so badly mutilated) except from his finger-tips. (It was on this occasion that) the Qur'anic verse:" Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with God. Of them some have completed their vow (to the extreme), and some still wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least" (xxxiii. 23). The narrator said that the verse had been revealed about him (Anas b. Nadr) and his Companions.
1904.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Musa Ash'ari that a desert Arab came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said:Messenger of Allah, one man fights fgr the spoils of war; another fights that he may be remembered, and another fights that he may see his (high) position (achieved as a result of his valour in fighting). Which of these is fighting in the cause of God? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who fights so that the word of Allah is exalted is fighting in the way of Allah.
1904.02 | It has been narrated (through another chain of transmitters) on the authority of Abu Musa who said. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked which of the men fights in the way of Allah:(one who fights) for displaying his valour; (a man who) fights out of his family pride and (a man who) fights for the sake of show, who amongst these fights in the way of Allah? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who fights that the word of Allah be exalted fights in the way of Allah.
1904.03 | It has been narrated (through yet another chain of transmitters) on the same authority, i. e. Abu Musa, who said:We, came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, one of us hho fights to display his valour... (followed by the same words as we have in the previous tradition).
1904.04 | It has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters on the same authority, i. e. Abu Musa Ash'ari, that a man asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about fighting in the way of Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, a man who fights out of rage or out of family pride. He raised his head towards him-and he did so because the man was standing and said:Who fights that the word of Allah be exalted fights in the way of Allah.
1905.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Sulaiman b. Yasar who said:People dispersed from around Abu Huraira, and Natil, who was from the Syrians. said to him: O Shaikh, relate (to us) a tradition you have heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: Yes. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: The first of men (whose case) will be decided on the Day of Judgment will be a man who died as a martyr. He shall be brought (before the Judgment Seat). Allah will make him recount His blessings (i. e. the blessings which He had bestowed upon him) and he will recount them (and admit having enjoyed them in his life). (Then) will Allah say: What did you do (to requite these blessings)? He will say: I fought for Thee until I died as a martyr. Allah will say: You have told a lie. You fought that you might be called a" brave warrior". And you were called so. (Then) orders will be passed against him and he will be dragged with his face downward and cast into Hell. Then will be brought forward a man who acquired knowledge and imparted it (to others) and recited the Qur'an. He will be brought And Allah will make him recount His blessings and he will recount them (and admit having enjoyed them in his lifetime). Then will Allah ask: What did you do (to requite these blessings)? He will say: I acquired knowledge and disseminated it and recited the Qur'an seeking Thy pleasure. Allah will say: You have told a lie. You acquired knowledge so that you might be called" a scholar," and you recited the Qur'an so that it might be said:" He is a Qari" and such has been said. Then orders will be passed against him and he shall be dragged with his face downward and cast into the Fire. Then will be brought a man whom Allah had made abundantly rich and had granted every kind of wealth. He will be brought and Allah will make him recount His blessings and he will recount them and (admit having enjoyed them in his lifetime). Allah will (then) ask: What have you done (to requite these blessings)? He will say: I spent money in every cause in which Thou wished that it should be spent. Allah will say: You are lying. You did (so) that it might be said about (You):" He is a generous fellow" and so it was said. Then will Allah pass orders and he will be dragged with his face downward and thrown into Hell.

She said: Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah that He may include me among these warriors. He prayed for her. Then he placed his head (down) and dozed off (again). He woke up laughing, as before. (She said) I said: Messenger of Allah, what makes you laugh? He replied: A people from my Umma were presented to me. They were fighters in Allah's way. (He described them in the same words as he had described the first warriors.) She said: Messenger of Allah, pray to God that He may include me among these warriors.

1913.01 | It has been narrated on the authority of Salman who said:I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Keeping watch for a day and a night is better (in point of reward) than fasting for a whole month and standing in prayer every night.

He said: One who is slain in the way of Allah is a martyr; one who dies in the way of Allah, is a martyr; one who dies of plague is a martyr; one who dies of cholera is a martyr.

But if you find another dog besides it, and you fear that that dog (the second one) had caught it (the game) along with that (your dog) and killed it. then don't eat; for you recited the name of Allah on your dog and did not recite that on the other one (which joined your dog incidentally).

We came near that and we found that it was a beast, called al-'Anbar (spermaceti whale). Abu 'Ubaida said. It is dead. He then said: No (but it does not matter), we have been sent by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the path of Allah and you are hard pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you eat that.

That is why it was called the Detachment of the Leaves. The ocean cast out for us an animal which was called al-'Anbar (whale). We ate of that for half of the month and rubbed its fat on our (bodies) until our bodies became stout. Abu 'Ubaida caught hold of one of its ribs and fixed that up. He then cast a glance at the tallest man of the army and the highest of the camels. and then made him ride over that, and that-tnan passed beneath it (the rib), and many a man could sit in its eye-socket, and we extracted many pitchers of fat from the cavity of its eye. We had small bags containing dates with us (before finding the whale). 'Ubaida gave every person amongst us a handful of dates (and when the provision ran short), he then gave each one of us one date. And when that (stock) was exhausted, we felt its loss.

Had it been forbidden (haram), it could not be eaten on the table of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
1948 | Yazid b. al-Asamm reported:A newly wedded person of Medina invited us to a wedding feast, and he served us thirteen lizards. There were those who ate it and those who abandoned it. I met Ibn 'Abbas the next day, and informed him (about this) in the presence of many persons. Some of them said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had observed: I neither eat it nor forbid (anyone) from eating it, nor declare it to be unlawful. Thereupon Ibn 'Abbas said: Sad it is what you say! Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) has not been sent, but (to declare in clear words) the lawful and the unlawful (things). We were once with Allah's Messenger (may peace be. upon him) as he was with Maimuna, and there were with him al-Fadl b. 'Abbas, Khalid b. Walid and some women (also) when a tray of food containing flesh was presented to him. As Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) was about to eat that, Maimuna said: It is the flesh of the lizard. He withdrew his hand saying: That is the flesh which I never eat; but he said to them (those who were present there): You may eat. Al-Fadl ate out of that, so did Khalid b Walid, and the women. Maimuna (however) said: I do not eat anything but that which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) eats.
1949 | Abu Zubair reported that he heard Jabir b. 'Abdullah saying that there was presented to Allah's Messenger (the flesh) of the lizard, but he refused to eat that, saying:I do not know; perhaps it (lizard) might (be one of those natives of) the distant past whose (forms) had beer, distorted.

Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, has (made it a source) of benefit for more than one (persons). It is a common diet of the shepherds. Had it been with me, I would have eaten that.
1951.01 | Abu Sa'id reported that a person said:Messenger of Allah, we live in a land abounding in lizards, so what do you command or what verdict you give (about eating of it)? Thereupon he said: It was mentioned to me that a people from among Bani Isra'il were distorted (so there is a likelihood that those people might have been distorted in the shape of lizards). So he neither commanded (us to eat that) nor forbade (us). Abu Sa'id said: After some time Umar said: Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, has made it (a source of) benefit for more than one (person), for it is the common diet of shepherds. Had it been with me, I would have eaten that. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) disliked it.
1951.02 | Abu Sa'id reported that an Arab of the desert came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:I live in a low land abounding in lizards, and these are the common diet of my family, but he (the Holy Prophet) did not make any reply.

(It was repeated thrice ) Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called him out at the third time saying: O man of the desert, verily Allah cursed or showed wrath to a tribe of Bani Isra'il and distorted them to beasts which move on the earth. I do not know, perhaps this (lizard) may be one of them. So I do not eat it, nor do I prohibit the eating of it.

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Offer again your sacrifice. He said: Messenger of Allah, I have a small milch goat of less than one year, and that is better than two dry goats (from which only) meat (can be acquired).

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is the thing in which you have made haste for your family. He said: I have a goat with me better than two goats. Thereupon he said: Sacrifice it for that is the best.
1961.05 | Al-Bara' b. 'Azib reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said:The first (act) with which we started our day (the day of 'Id-ul Adha) was that we offered prayer.

And he who slaughtered the (animal on that day before the 'Id prayer), for him (the slaughtering of animal was directed to the acquiring of) meat for his family, and there is nothing of the sort of sacrifice in it. It was Abu Burda b. Niyar who had slaughtered (the animal before the 'Id prayer). He said: I have a small lamb, of less than one year, but better than that of more than a year.

I have nothing with me but a goat of less than six months. Shu'ba (one of the narrators) said: I think he (al-Bara' b. 'Azib also) said: And it is better than a goat of one year. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Make it a substitute for that (and sacrifice it), but it will not suffice for anyone (as a sacrifice) after you.

'Abd al-Muttalib was busy in drinking in that house in the company of a singing girl who was singing to him. She said:Hamza, get up for slaughtering the fat she-camels.

When I made up my mind to consummate my marriage with Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I prevailed upon a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa' to go along with me so that we might bring Idhkhir wishing to sell that to the goldsmiths and thus I should be able to arrange my wedding feast. While I was arranging the equipments. i. e. litters, sacks and ropes, my two she-camels were sitting down at the side of the apartment of a person of the Ansar. I collected (the different articles of equipment) and found to my surprise that their humps had been chopped off and their haunches had been cut off and their livers had been taken out. I could not help weeping when I saw that plight of theirs. I said: Who has done that? They said: Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib has done this. and he is in this house dead drunk in the company of some of the Ansair with asinging girl singing before him and his companions. She said in her song: O Hamza. get up and attack these falty she-camels. Thereupon Hamza stood up with a sword (in his hand) and cut off their humps and ripped their haunches and tore out their livers. 'Ali said: I went away until I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and there was with him Zaid b. Haritha. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recognised from my face what I had experienced, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: What has happened to you? I said: Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I have never seen (such an unfortunate day) as this day. Hamza has committed aggression to my she-camels, and has cut off their humps. and ripped their haunches, and he is in a house in the company of some drunkards. (Hearing this) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for his mantle and, putting it on him, he proceeded, and I and Zaid b. Haritha followed him, until he came to the door (of the house) in which there was Hamza. He (the Holy Prophet) sought permission which they granted him. and they were all drunk. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) began to reprimand Hamza for what he had done. Hamza's eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and then looked towards his knees. and then lifted his eyes and cast a glance at his waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then Hamza said: Are you anything but the slaves of my father? Alah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to know that he was intoxicated, and he thus turned upon his heels, and came out, and we also came out along with him.

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Do not remove your earthen pot from the hearth and do not bake the bread from the kneaded flour until I come. So I came and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and he was ahead of the people; and I came to my wife and she said (to me): You will be humbled. I said: I did what you had asked me to do. She (his wife) said: I brought out the kneaded flour and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) put some saliva of his in that and blessed It. He then put saliva in the earthen pot and blessed it and then said. Call another baker who can bake with you. and bring out the soup from it, but do not remove it from the hearth, and the guests were one thousand. (Jabir said): I take an oath by Allah that all of them ate (the food to their fill) until they left it and went away and our earthen pot was brimming over as before, and so was the case with our flour, or as Dahhak (another narrator) said: It (the flour) was in the same condition and loaves had been prepared from that.
2040.01 | Anas b. Malik reported that Abu Talha said to Umm Sulaim:I felt some feebleness in the voice of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and perceived that it was due to hunger; so have you anything with you? She said: Yes. She brought out barley loaves, then took out a head-covering of hers, in a part of which she wrapped those loaves and then put them beneath my mantle and covered me with a part of it. She then sent me to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I set forth and found Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sitting in the mosque in the company of some persons. I stood near them, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Has Abu Talha sent you? I said, Yes. He said: Is it for a feast? I said. Yes. Thereupon Allah's messenger (ﷺ) said to'those who were with him to get up He went forth and so I did before them, until I came to Abu Talha and informed him. Abu Talba said: Umm Sulaim, here comes Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with people and we do not have enough (food) to feed them. She said: Allah and His Messenger know best. Abu Talha went out (to receive him) Until he met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came forward along with him until they both (Allah's Messenger, along with Abu Talha) came in. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Umm Sulaim. bring forth that which you have with you. She brought the bread. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded that the bread be broken into small pieces, and when Umm Sulaim had squeezed a small waterskin and put seasoning on it, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited something regarding it what Allah wished him to say. He then said: Allow ten (guests to come in and have their meals). He permitted them; they ate until they had their fill. They then went out. He (the Holy Prophet) again said: Permit ten (more) and he (the host gave permission to them. They ate until they had enough. Then they went out. he again said: Permit ten (more) until all the people had eaten to their fill, and they were seventy or eighty persons.
2040.02 | Anas b. Malik reported:Abu Talha sent me to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in order to invite him (for meal). She had prepared a meal. So I came and found Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with some people. He looked at me, and I felt shy and said: Accept the invitation of Abu Talha. He (the Holy Prophet) asked the people to get up. Thereupon Abu Talha said: Allah's Messenger, I have prepared something for you. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) touched (the food) and invoked blessings upon it, and then said: Let ten persons from my Companions enter (the house). He then said: Eat, and (in the meanwhile) brought out something from between his fingers for them. They then began to eat until they had their fill and then went out. He then asked ten more men (to have the meal) and they ate to their fill, and the ten persons went on getting in (and eating the food) and then getting out until none was left amongst them who had not got in and eaten to his fill. He then collected (the remaining part of the food) and it (the quantity of the food) was the same (as it had been prior to the serving of guests).
2040.03 | Anas b Malik reported:Abu Talha sent me to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ; the rest of the hadith is the same, but 'there is a slight variation of wording that he said at the end (The Holy Prophet) took what was left (of the food) and collected it and then invoked blessings upon it and it returned to its original state. He (the Holy Prophet) then said Take this.
2040.04 | Anas b. Malik reported:Abu Talha ordered Umm Sulaim to prepare a meal specially for Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). He then sent me to him (to the Holy Prophet) ; the rest of the hadith is the same (but there is a slight variation of wording):" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) placed his hand and mentioned the name of Allah upon that, and then said: Admit ten men. He (Abu Talha) admitted them and they got in. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Eat while mentioning the name of Allah upon it (the meal). They ate until eighty persons had taken the food. Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had his meal and so the members of the household, and still they left some food."
2040.05 | Anas b. Malik reported this incident pertaining to the feast given by Abu Talha to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) with the addition of these words:" Abu Talha stood at the door (to welcome the honourable guest) until Allah's Messenger (may peacec be upon him) came there, He (Abu Talha) said to him: Allah's Messenger, the thing (we intend to offer you as a meal) is small in quantity. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Bring that, for Allah will soon bless it (and increase it).

He came to Umm Sulaim and said: I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) lying down upon the belly in the mosque, and I think he is hungry.

Malik, but there was left some. thing which we presented to our neighbours.
2040.08 | Anas b. Malik reported:I visited Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) one day and found him sitting in the company of his Companions and talking to them, and he had tied his belly with a bandage. Usama said: I am in doubt whether there was stone on that (his belly) or not. I asked some of his Companions why Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had bandaged his belly. They said: (He has done that to relieve) his hunger. I went to Abu Talha, the husband of Umm Sulaim, the daughter of Milhan, and said to him: Father, I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having bandaged his belly. I asked some of his Companions (the reason of it) and they said that it was due to hunger. Abu Talha came to mv mother and said: Is there anything? She said: Yes, I have some pieces of bread with me and some dates. If Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) comes to us alone we can feed him to his fill, but if someone comes along with him this would be insufficient for them. The rest of the hadith is the same.

One night, Abu Ayyub Ansari got up and said (to himself): (How unfortunate it is) that we walk above the head of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), so they went aside and spent the night in a nook and then told Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) about it whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: The lower storey is more comfortable (for me). but he (Abu Ayyub Ansari) said: We (would not live) over the roof under which you live. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) shifted to the upper storey, whereas Abu Ayyub Ansari shifted to the lower storey; and he (Abu Ayyub Ansari) used to prepare food for Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) ; and when it was brought (back) to him he asked (to locate) the part, where his fingers had touched (the food), and he followed his fingers on that part where his fingers (those of the Holy Prophet) had touched it. (One day) he prepared food which contained garlic, and when it was returned to him he asked (to locate) the part which the fingers of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had touched. It was said to him that he had not eaten (the food). He (Abd Ayyub Ansari) was distressed and went up to him (to the Holy Prophet) and said: Is it forbidden? But Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: No, (it is not forbidden), but I do not like it. and he (Abu Ayyub Ansari) said: I also do not like what you do not like or which you did not like.

He sent (message) to one of his wives (to procure food for him). but she said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth, thrre is nothing with me (to serve him) but only water. He (the Holy Prophet) then sent the (same) message to another, and she gave the same reply, until all of them gave the same reply: By Him Who has sent thee with the Truth, there is nothing with me but only water, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah would show mercy to him who will entertain this guest tonight. A person from the Ansar stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, I (am ready to entertain). He took him to his house and said to his wife: Is there anything with you (to serve the gdest)? She said: No, but only a subsistence for our children. He said: Distract their attention with something, and when the guest enters extinguish the lamp and give him the impression that we are eating. So they sat down. and the guest had his meal. When it was morning he went to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) who said: Allah was well pleased with what you both did for your guest this night.
2054.02 | Abu Huraira reported that a guest spent the night with a person from the Ansar who had nothing with him but food (sufficient) for his own self and his children. He said to his wife:(Lull) the children to sleep, and put out the lamp, and serve the guest with what you have with you. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:" Those who prefer the needy to their own selves in spite of the fact that they are themselves in pressing need" (Lix. 9).
2054.03 | Abu Huraira reported that a man came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so that he should entertain him as a guest, but he had nothing with which he could entertain him. He, therefore, asked if there was any person who would entertain him (assuring the audience) that Allah would show mercy to him. A person from the Ansar who was called Abu Talha stood up and he took him to his house. The rest of the hadith is the same and mention is (also) made in that about the revelation of the verse as narrated by Waki'.
2055.01 | Miqdad reported:I and two of my companions were so much afflicted by hunger that we had lost our power of seeing and hearing. We presented ourselves (as guests) to the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), but none amongst them would entertain us. So we came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), and he took us to his residence and there were three goats. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Milk these for us. So we milked them and every person amongst us drank his share and we set aside the share of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). (It was his habit) to come during the night and greet (the people present there) in a manner that would not wake up one in sleep but make one who was awake hear it. He would then go to the mosque and say prayer, then go to the milk and drink it. Miqdad added: One night the Satan came to me when I had taken my share, and he said: Muhammad has gone to the Ansar, who would offer him hospitality and he would get what is with them, and he has no need for this draught (of milk). So I took (that milk) and drank it, and when it had penetrated deeply in my stomach and I was certain that there was no way out (but to digest it), the Satan aroused (my sense of) remorse and said: Woe be to thee! what have you done? You have taken the drink reserved for Muhammad! When he would come and he would not find it, he would curse you, and you would be ruined, and thus there would go (waste) this world and the Hereafter (for) you. There was a sheet over me; as I placed (pulled) it upon my feet, my head was uncovered and as I placed it upon my head, my feet were uncovered, and I could not sleep, but my two companions had gone to sleep for they had not done what I had done. There came Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), and he greeted as he used to greet (by saying as-Salamu 'Alaikum). He then came to the mosque and observed prayer and then came to his drink (milk) and uncovered it, but did not find anything in it. He raised his head towards the sky, and I said (to myself) that he (the Holy Prophet) was going to invoke curse upon me and I would be thus ruined; but he (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah, feed him who fed me and give drink to him who provided me drink. I held tight the sheet upon myself (and when he had supplicated), I took hold of the knife and went to the goats (possessed by the Holy Prophet) so that I may slauhter one for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which was the fattest amongst them, and in fact all of them were milch goats; then I took hold of the vessel which belonged to the family of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in which they used to milk and drink therefrom, and milked them in that until it swelled up with foam. I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he said: Have you taken your share of the milk during the night? I said: Drink it. and he drank it; he then handed over (the vessel) to me and I said: Allah's Messenger, drink it, and he drank it and handed over (the vessel) to me again, I then perceived that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had been satiated and I had got his blessings. I burst into laughter (so much) so that I fell upon the ground, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Miqdad, it must be one of your mischiefs. I said: Allah's Messenger, this affair of mind is like this and this. and I have done so. Thereupon. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: This is nothing but a mercy from Allah. Why is it that you did not give me an opportunity so that we should have awakened our two friends and they would have got their share (of the milk)? I said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth. I do not mind whatever you give (to them), and whatever the (other) people happen to get, when I had got it along with you from among the people.
2055.02 | This hadith has been reported on the authority of Mughira with the same chain of transmitters.
2056 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr reported:We were one hundred and thirty (persons) with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Does any one of You possess food? There was a person with (us) who had a sa' of flour or something about that, and it was kneaded. Then a tall polytheist with dishevelled hair came driving his flock of sheep. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Would you like to sell it (any one of these goats) or offer it as a gift or a present? He said: No, (I am not prepared to offer as a gift), but I would sell it. He (the Holy Prophet) bought a sheep from him, and it was slaughtered and its meat was prepared, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded that its liver should be roasted. He (the narrator) said: By Allah, none among one hundred and thirty persons was left whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not given a part out of her liver; if anyone was present he gave it to him. but if he was absent it was set aside for him. And he (the Holy Prophet) filled two bowls (one with soup and the other with mutton) and we all ate out of them to our hearts' content, but (still) some part was (left) in (those) two bowls, and I placed it on the camel- (or words to the same effect).
2057.01 | 'Abd al-Rabman b. Abu Bakr reported that the people of Suffa were very poor. Once the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said (to his Companions):He who amongst you has food for two persons should take three (guests with him). and he who has with him food for four persons should take five or six (guests with him for entertaining them). It was (in accordance with these instructions of the Holy Prophet) that Abu Bakr brought three persons, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) brought ten persons (as guests to their respective houses). Abu Bakr had brought three persons (he himself, and myself), my father and my mother (along with therm). He (the narrator) said: I do not know whether he also said: My wife and one servant who was common between our house and that of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr had had his evening meal with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). He stayed here until night prayer had been offered. He then came back (to the house of Allah's Apostle) and stayed there until Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) felt drowsy and (Abu Bakr) then came (back to his own house) when (a considerable) part of the night had been over, as Allah had desired. His wife said to him: What held you back from your guests? He said: Oh! have you not served them the evening meal (by this time)? She said: It was in fact served to them. but they refused to eat until you came. He ('Abd al-Rahman) said: I slunk away and bid myself. He (Abu Bakr) said: O, you stupid fellow, and he reprimanded me, and said to the guests: Eat, though it may not be pleasant now. He said: By Allah. I will never eat it He ('Abd al-Rahman) said: By Allah. we did not take a morsel when from beneath that (there appeared) more until they had eaten to their fill, and lo! it was more than what it was before. Abu Bakr saw that and found that it was so or more than that. He said to his wife: Sister of Band Firis, what is th-is? She said: By the coolness of my eyes. it is in excess by three times over the previous one. Then Abu Bakr ate saying: That was from the Satan (viz. his vow for not eating the food). He then took a morsel out of that and then took it (the rest) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and it was kept there until morning, and during (those days) there was a covenant between us and some other people, and the period of covenant was over, and we had appointed twelve officials with every person amongst them. It is Allah only Who knows as to how many people were there with each of them. He sent (this food to them) and all of them ate out of it.
2057.02 | 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abd Bakr reported:There came to our house some guests. It was a common practice with my father to (go) and talk to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) during the night. While going he said: 'Abd al-Rahman, entertain the guests. When it was evening we served the food to them, but they refused saying: So long as the owner of the house does not come and join us, we would not take the meal. I said to them: He ('Abd Bakr) is a stern person, and if you would not do that (if you do not take the food). I fear, I may be harmed by him, but they refused. As he (my father) came, the first thing he asked was: Have you served the guests? They (the peopleof the household) said: We have not served them sofar. He said: Did I not command 'Abd al-Rahman (to do this)? He ('Abd al-Rahman) said: I slunk away and kept myself away by that time. He again said: O stupid fellow, I ask you on oath that In case you hear my voice you come to me. I came and said: By Allah, there is no fault of mine. These are your guests; you may ask them. I provided them with food but they refused to eat until you came. He said to them: Why is it that you did not accept our food? By Allah, I shall not even take food tonight (as you have not taken). They said: By Allah, we would not take until you join us. Thereupon he Abu Bakr) said: I have never seen a more unfortunate night than this. Woe be to thee! that you do not accept from us food prepared for you. He again said: What I did first (that is the taking of vow for not eating the food) was prompted by the Satan. Bring the food. The food was brought, and he ate by reciting the name of Allah and they also ate, and when it was morning he came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, their oath (that of the guests) came to be true, but mine was not true, and after that he informed him of the whole incident. He said: Your oath came to be the most true and you are the best of them. He (the narrator) said. I do not know whether he made an atonement for it.

I said to him: From whom (did you hear it)? They said: 'Amir b. Sa'd has narrated it. So I came to him. They said that he was not present there. So I met his brother Ibrahim b. Sa'd and asked him. He said: I bear testimony to the fact that Usama narrated it to Sa'd saying: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying that it is a God-sent punishment from the calamity or from the remnant of the calamity with which people were afflicted before you.

They informed him that a scourge had broken out in Syria. Ibn 'Abbas further reported that 'Umar said: Call to me tile earliest emigrants. So I called them. He (Hadrat 'Umar) sought their advice, and they told him that the scourge had broker, out in Syria. There was a difference of opinion (whether they should proceed further or go back to their homes in such a situation). Some of them said: You ('Umar) have set forth for a task, and, therefore, we would not advise you to go back, whereas some of them said: You have along with you the remnants (of the sacred galaxy) of men and (the blessed) Companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), so we would not advise you to go forth towards this calamity (with such eminent persons and thus expose them deliberately to a danger). He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: You can now go away. He said: Call to me the Ansar. So I called them to him, and he consulted them, and they trod the same path as was trodden by the Muhajirin, and they differed in their opinions as they had differed. He said: Now, you can go. He again said: Call to me the old persons of the Quraish who had migrated before the Victory (that is the Victory of Mecca), so I called them (and Hadrat 'Umar consulted them) and not even two persons differed (from the opinion held by the earlier delegates). They said: Our opinion is that you better go back along with the people and do not make them go to this scourge, So 'Umar made announcement to the people: In the morning I would be on the back of my side. So they (set forth in the morning), whereupon Abu 'Ubaida b. Jarrah said: Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree? Thereupon 'Umar said: Had it been someone else to say this besides you! 'Umar (in fact) did not approve of his opposing (this decision) and he said: Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree (to the) Divine Decree. You should think if there had been camels for you and you happened to get down in a valley having two sides, one of them covered with verdure and the other being barren, would you not (be doing) according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in verdure? And in case you graze them in the barren land (even then you would be grazing them) according to the Divine Decree. There happened to come 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf and he had been absent in connection with some of his needs. He said: I have with me a knowledge of it, that I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: If you hear of its presence (the presence of plague) in a land, don't enter it, but if it spreads in the land where you are, don't fly from it. Thereupon 'Umar b. Khattab praised Allah and then went back?

Abu Dhubab (and he was the first cousin of Abu Huraira) said: Abu Huraira, I used to hear from you that you narrated to us along with this hadith and the other one also (there is no transitive disease), but now you observe silence about it. You used to say that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: There is no transitive disease. Abu Huraira denied having any knowledge of that, but he said that the sick camel should not be taken to the healthy one. Harith, however, did not agree with him, which irritated Abu Huraira and he said to him some words in the Abyssinian language. He said to Harith: Do you know what I said to you? He said: No. Abu Huraira said: I simply denied having said it. Abu Salama sad: By my life, Abu Huraira in fact used to report Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said: There is no transitive disease. I do not know whether Abu Huraira has forgotten it or he deemed it an abrogated statement in the light of the other one.

Ibn 'Abbas reported:A person from the Ansar who was amongst the Companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reported to me: As we were sitting during the night with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), a meteor shot gave a dazzling light. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: What did you say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shot (of meteor)? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: (These meteors) are shot neither at the death of anyone nor on the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues Command when He decides to do a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of heaven who are near to them until this glory of God reaches them who are in the heaven of this world. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches the heaven of the world. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages to overhear and he carries it to his friends. And when the Angels see the jinn they attack them with meteors. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.

I looked towards it and found a snake. I jumped up in order to kill it, but he (Abu Sa'id Khudri) made a gesture that I should sit down. So I sat down and as he finished (the prayer) he pointed to a room in the house and said: Do you see this room? I said: Yes. He said: There was a young man amongst us who had been newly wedded. We went with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (to participate in the Battle) of Trench when a young man in the midday used to seek permission from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to return to his family. One day he sought permission from him and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (after granting him the permission) said to him: Carry your weapons with you for I fear the tribe of Quraiza (may harm you).

He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out having fixed it in the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died first, the snake or the young man. We came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and made a mention to him and said: Supplicate to Allah that that (man) may be brought back to life. Thereupon he said: Ask forgiveness for your companion and then said: There are in Medina jinns who have accepted Islam, so when you see any one of them, pronounce a warning to it for three days, and if they appear before you after that, then kill it for that is a devil.

Abu Bakr said: Allah's Messenger, may my father be sacrificed for you, by Allah, allow me to interpret it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Well, give its interpretation. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: The canopy signifies the canopy of Islam and that what trickles out of it in the form of butter and honey is the Holy Qur'an and its sweetness and softness and what the people get hold of it in their palms implies major portion of the Qur'an or the small portion; and so far as the rope joining the sky with the earth is concerned, it is the Truth by which you stood (in the worldly life) and by which Allah would raise you (to Heaven). Then the person after you would take hold of it and he would also climb up with the help of it. Then another person would take hold of it and climb up with the help of it. Then another person would take hold of it and it would be broken; then it would be rejoined for him and he would climb up with the help of it. Allah's Messenger, may my father be taken as a ransom for you, tell me whether I have interpreted it correctly or I have made an error. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: You have interpreted a part of it correctly and you have erred in interpreting a part of it.

Rafi` that there was brought to us the fresh dates of Ibn Tab. I interpreted it as the sublimity for us in the world and good ending in the Hereafter and that our religion is good.
2271 | Abdullah b. `Umar reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:I saw in a dream that I was using miswak and two persons contended to get it from me, one being older than the other one. I gave the miswak to the younger one. It was said to me to give that to the older one and I gave it to the older one.
2272 | Abu Musa reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:I dreamt (while asleep) that I was about to migrate from Mecca to a land abounding in palm trees and I guessed that it would be Yamama or Hajar, but it was the city of Yathrib (the old name of Medina), and I saw in this dream of mine that I was brandishing a sword and its upper end was broken and this is what fell (in the form of misfortune to the believers on the Day of Uhud). I brandished (the sword) for the second time and it became all right and this is what came to be true when Allah granted us victory and solidarity of the believers. And I saw therein cows also and Allah is the Doer of good. These meant the group from amongst the believers on the Day of Uhud and the goodness which Allah brought after that and the reward of attestation of his Truth which Allah brought to us after the Day of Badr.
2273 | Ibn `Abbas reported that Musailima al-Kadhdhab (the greater liar) (who claimed prophethood after the death of the Holy Prophet) came during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) to Medina and said:If Muhammad assigns his caliphate to me after him I would follow him, and there came along with him a large body of persons of his tribe, and there came to him Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) along with Thabit b. Qais b. Shammas and the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) had a piece of wood in his hand until he came in front of Musailima in the company of his companions and said: If you were to ask even this (wood), I would never give it to you. I am not going to do anything against the will of God in your case, and if you turn away (from what I say) Allah will destroy you. And I find you in the same state which I was shown (in the dream) and here is Thabit and he would answer you on my behalf. He (the Holy Prophet) then went back. Ibn `Abbas said: I asked the (meaning of the) words of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ): "You are the same what I was made to see about you in my dream." and Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: While I was sleeping I saw in my hands two gold bangles. This had a disturbing effect upon me and I was given a suggestion in the sleep that I should blow over them, so I blew over them and they were no more. And I interpreted these (two bangles) as the two great liars who would appear after me and the one amongst them was Al-`Anasi the inhabitant of San`a' and the other one Musailima the inhabitant of Yamama.
2274.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:While I was sleeping, the treasures of the earth were presented to me and I was made to wear in my hands two gold bangles. I felt a sort of burden upon me and I was disturbed and it was suggested to me that I should blow over them, so I blew and both of them disappeared. I interpreted them as two great liars who would appear at any time, one is the inhabitant of San`a' and the other is that of Yamama.

2279.02 | Anas b. Malik reported:I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) during the time of the afternoon prayer and the people asking for water for performing ablution which they did not find. (A small quantity) of water was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he placed his hand in that vessel and commanded people to perform ablution. I saw water spouting from his fingers and the people performing ablution until the last amongst them performed it.
2279.03 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and his Companions were at a place known as az-Zaura' (az-Zaurd' is a place in the bazar of Medina near the mosque) that he called for a vessel containing water. He put his hand in that. And there began to spout (water) between his fingers and all the Companions performed ablution. Qatada, one of the narrators in the chain of narrators, said:Abu Hamza (the kunya of Hadrat Anas b. Malik), how many people were they? He said: They were about three hundred.
2279.04 | Anas reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) was at az-Zaura' and a vessel containing water was brought to him in which his finger could not be completely dipped or completely covered; the rest of the hadith is the same.
2280 | Jabir reported that Umm Malik used to send clarified butter in a small skin to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Her sons would come to her and ask for seasoning when they had nothing with them (in the form of condiments) and she would go to that (skin) in which she offered (clarified butter) to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), and she would find in that clarified butter and it kept providing her with seasoning for her household until she had (completely) squeezed it. She came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and (informed him about it). Thereupon, he (the Holy Prophet) said:Did you squeeze it? She said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If you had left it in that very state, it would have kept on provid- ing you (the clarified butter) on end.
2281 | Jabir reported that a person came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and asked for food. And he gave him half a wasq of barley, and the person and his wife and their guests kept on making use of it (as a food) until he weighed it (in order to find out the actual quantity, and it was no more). He came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) (and informed him about it). He said:Had you not weighed it, you would be eating out of it and it would have remained intact for you.
706.03 | Mu'adh b. Jabal reported that he went along with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) in the expedition of Tabuk and he (the Holy Prophet) combined the prayers. He offered the noon and afternoon prayers together and the sunset and night prayers together and on the other day he deferred the prayers; he then came out and offered the noon and afternoon prayers together. He then went in and (later on) came out and then after that offered the sunset and night prayers together and then said:God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you should not come to that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not touch its water until I come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain ahead of us. It was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked them whether they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) scolded them, and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took it again in that (fountain) and there gushed forth abundant water from that fountain, until all the people drank to their fill. He then said: Mu'adh, it is likely that if you live long that you see what is here filled with gardens.
1392.02 | Abu Humaid as-Sa'idi reported:We went out with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the expedition to Tabuk and we came to a wadi where there was a garden belonging to a woman. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said. Make an assessment (of the price of its fruit). And Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also made an assessment and it was ten wasqs. He asked that lady (to calculate the amount) until they would, God willing, come back to her. So we proceeded on until we came to Tabuk and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The violent storm will overtake you during the night, so none amongst you should stand up and he who has a camel with him should hobble it firmly. A violent storm blew and a person who had stood up was carried away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy. Then the messenger of the son of al 'Alma', the ruler of Aila, came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with a letter and a gift of a white mule. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wrote him (the reply) and presented him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the Wadi al-Qura. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked that lady about her garden and the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I am going to depart, and he who amongst you wishes may depart with me but he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the journey until we came to the outskirts of Medina. (It was at this time) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: This is Taba, this is Uhud, that is a mountain which loves us and we love it, and then said: The best amongst the houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa'ida, and there is goodness in all the houses of the Ansar. Said b. Ubada came to us and Abu Usaid said to him: Did you not see that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has declared the houses of the Ansar good and he has kept us at the end. Said met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.
1392.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Amr b. Yahya with the same chain of transmitters up to the words:There is good in all the houses of the Ansar, and there is no mention of the subsequent event pertaining to Sa'd b. 'Ubada.
843.03 | Jabir b. Abdullah reported:We went along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on an expedition towards Najd and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) found us in a valley abounding in thorny trees. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stayed for rest under a tree and he suspended his sword by one of its branches under which he was taking rest. The persons scattered in the valley and they also began to take rest under the shade of trees, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: A person came to me while I was asleep and he took hold of the sword. I woke up and found him standing upon my head and I had hardly become alert (and saw) that the sword was in his hand. And he said: Who can protect you from me? I said: Allah. He again said: Who can protect you from me? I said: Allah. He put his sword in the sheath (and you can see) this man sitting here. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not in any way touch him.
843.04 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah al-Ansiri, who was one amongst the Companions of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), reported that he went on an expedition along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) towards Najd and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stayed there, and when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came back he also came back along with him.

2282 | Abu Musa reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:The similitude of that guidance and knowledge with which Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has sent me is that of rain falling upon the earth. There is a good piece of land which receives the rainfall (eagerly) and as a result of it there is grown in it herbage and grass abundantly. Then there is a land hard and barren which retains water and the people derive benefit from it and they drink it and make the animals drink. Then there is another land which is barren. Neither water is retained in it, nor is the grass grown in it. And that is the similitude of the first one who develops the understanding of the religion of Allah and it becomes a source of benefit to him with which Allah sent me. (The second one is that) who acquires the knowledge of religion and imparts it to others. (Then the other type is) one who does not pay attention to (the revealed knowledge) and thus does not accept guidance of Allah with which I have been sent.
2283 | Abu Musa reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The similitude of mine and of that with which Allah sent me is that of a person who came to us and said: O people, I have seen an army with my eyes and I am a plain warner (and issue you warning) that you should immediately manage to find an escape. A group of people from amongst them paying heed (to his warning) fled to a place of protection and a group amongst them belied him and the morning overtook them in their houses and the army attacked them and killed them and they were routed. And that is the similitude of the one who obeyed me, followed with which I had been sent and the similitude of the other is of one who disobeyed and belied me and the Truth with which I have been sent.
2284.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The similitude of mine and that of my Umma is that of a person who lit fire and there began to fall into it insects and moths. And I am there to hold you back, but you plunge into it.
2284.02 | The above hadith was likewise narrated with another chain of transmitters.
2284.03 | Hammam b. Munabbih reported:Abu Huraira reported us some ahadith from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) amongst many, (and) one is this that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: A person lit fire and when the atmosphere was aglow, moths and insects began to fall into the fire, but I am there to hold them back, but they are plunging into it despite my efforts, and he further added: That is your example and mine. I am there to hold you back from fire and to save you from it, but you are plunging into it despite my efforts.
2285 | Jabir b. Abdullah reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying. My example and your example is that of a person who lit the fire and insects and moths began to fall in it and he would be making efforts to take them out, and I am going to hold you back from fire, but you are slipping from my hand.
2286.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The similitude of mine and that of the Apostles (before me) is that of a person who constructed a building and he built it fine and well and the people went round it saying: Never have we seen a building more imposing than this. but for one brick, and I am that brick (with which you give the finishing touch to the building).
2286.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The similitude of mine and that of the Apostles before me is that of a person who built a house quite imposing and beautiful and he made it complete but for one brick in one of its corners. People began to walk round it, and the building pleased them and they would say: But for this brick your building would have been perfect. Muhammad (ﷺ) said: And I am that final brick.
2286.03 | Abu Hurairh reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The similitude of mine and that of the Apostles before me is that of a person who built a house quite imposing and beautiful, but for one brick in one of its corners. People would go round it, appreciating the building, but saying: Why has the brick not been fixed here? He said: I am that brick and I am the last of the Apostles.
2286.04 | Abu Sa'id reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The similitude of mine and that of the Apostles; the rest of the hadith is the same.
2287.01 | Jabir reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The similitude of mine and that of the Apostles is like that of a person who built a house and he completed it and made it perfect but for the space of a brick. People entered therein and they were surprised at it and said: Had there been a brick (it would have been complete in all respects). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I am that place where the brick (completing the building is to be placed), and I have come to finalise the chain of Apostles.
2287.02 | This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.
2288 | Abu Musa reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:When Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, intends to show mercy to an Umma from amongst His servants He calls back His Apostle to his eternal home and makes him a harbinger and recompense in the world to come; and when He intends to cause destruction to an Umma, He punishes it while its Apostle is alive and He destroys it as he (the Apostle) witnesses it and he cools his eyes by destruction as they had belied him and disobeyed his command.
2289.01 | Jundab reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: I shall be there at the Cistern before you.

2290 | Sahl (b. Sa'd) reported:I heard Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying: I shall go to the Cistern before you and he who comes would drink and he who drinks would never feel thirsty, and there would come to me people whom I would know and who would know me. Then there would be intervention between me and them. Abu Hazim said that Nu'man b. Abu 'Ayyash heard it and I narrated to them this hadith, and said: Is it this that you heard Sahl saying? He said: Yes, and I bear witness to the fact that I heard it from Abu Sa'id Khudri also, but he made this addition that he (the Holy Prophet) would say: They are my followers, and it would be said to him: You do not know what they did after you and I will say to them: Woe to him who changes (his religion) after me.
2291.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Sa'id Khudri through another chain of transmitters.
2292 | `Abdullah b. `Amr al-`As, reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:My Cistern (is as wide and broad that it requires) a month's journey (to go round it) all, and its sides are equal and its water is whiter than silver, and its odour is more fragrant than the fragrance of musk, and its jugs (placed around it) are like stars in the sky; and he who would drink from it would never feel thirsty after that. Asma', daughter of Abu Bakr said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I would be on the Cistern so that I would be seeing those who would be coming to me from you, but some people would be detained (before reaching me). I would say: My Lord, they are my followers and belong to my Ummah, and it would be said to me: Do you know what they did after you? By Allah, they did not do good after you, and they turned back upon their heels. He (the narrator) said: lbn Abu Mulaika used to say (in supplication): O Allah, I seek refuge with Thee that we should turn back upon our heels or put to any trial about our religion.
2294 | 'A'isha reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say in the company of his Companions: I would be on the Cistern waiting for those who would be coming to me from amongst you. By Allah, some persons would be prevented from coming to me, and I would say: My Lord, they are my followers and people of my Umma. And He would say,: You don't know what they did after you; they had been constantly turning back on their heels (from their religion).
2295.01 | Umm Salama, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), said I used to hear from people making a mention of the Cistern, but I did not hear about it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). One day while a girl was combing me I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say:" O people." I said to that girl: Keep away from me. She said: He (the Holy Prophet) has addressed the men only and he has not invited the attention of the women. I said: I am amongst the people also (and have thus every right to listen to the things pertaining to religion). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I shall be your harbinger on the Cistern; therefore, be cautious lest one of you should come (to me) and may be driven away like a stray camel. I would ask the reasons, and it would be said to me: You don't know what innovations they made after you. And I would then also say: Be away.
2295.02 | Umm Salama reported that she heard Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) saying this as he was sitting on the pulpit and she was getting her hair combed. (He uttered these words):" O people." And she said to one who was combing: Leave my head; the rest of the hadith is the same.
2296.01 | Uqba b. 'Amir reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) one day went out and he offered prayer over the martyrs of Uhud just as prayer is offered over the dead. He then came back and sat on pulpit and said:I shall be present there (at the Cistern) before you. I shall be your witness and, by Allah, I perceive as if I am seeing with my own eyes my Cistern at this very state and I have been given the keys of the treasures of the earth or the keys of the earth and, by Allah, I am not afraid concerning you that you would associate anything (with Allah after me), but I am afraid that you would be vying with one another (for the possession of) the treasures of the earth.
2296.02 | Uqba b. 'Amir reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Allah's Messenger offered prayer over those who had fallen matyrs at Uhud. He then climbed the pulpit as if someone is saying good-bye to the living and the dead, and then said: I shall be there as your predecesor on the Cistern before you, and it is as wide as the distance between Aila and Juhfa (Aila is at the top of the gulf of 'Aqaba). I am not afraid that you would associate anything with Allah after me, but I am afraid that you may be (allured) by the world and (vie) with one another (in possessing material wealth) and begin killing one another, and you would be destroyed as were destroyed those who had gone before you. 'Uqba said that that was the last occasion that he saw Allah's Massenger on the pulpit.
2297.01 | 'Abdullah reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying; I shall be there at the Cistern before you, and I shall have to contend for some people, but I shall have to yield.

2300 | Abu Dharr said:Allah's Messenger, what about the vessels of that Cistern? He said: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, the vessels would outnumber the stars in the sky and its planets shining on a dark cloudless night. These would be the vessels of Paradise. He who drinks out of it (the Cistern) would never feel thirsty. There would flow in it two spouts from Paradise and he who would drink out of it would not feel thirsty; and the distance between its (two corners) is that between 'Amman and Aila, and its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey.

The Ansari was enraged and said: Allah's Messenger, (you have given this decision) for he is the son of your father's sister. The face of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) underwent a change, and then said: Zubair, water (your date-palms), then hold it until it rises up to the walls. Zubair said: I think, by Allah, that this verse:" Nay, by the Lord, they will not (really) (believe) until they make thee a judge of what is in dispute among them, and find in this no dislike of what thou decidest and submit with full submission" (iv. 65).

And if you were to know you would have wept more and laughed less. He (the narrator) said: There was nothing more burdensome for the Companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) than this. They covered their heads and the sound of weeping was heard from them. Then there stood up 'Umar and he said: We are well pleased with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our code of life and with Muhammad as our Apostle, and it was at that time that a person stood up and he said: Who is my father? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Your father is so and so; and there was revealed the verse:" O you who believe, do not ask about matters which, if they were to be made manifest to you (in terms of law), might cause to you harm" (v. 101).

By Allah, I shall not move from this place so long as I do not inform you about that which you ask. Anas b. Malik said: People began to shed tears profusely when they heard this from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said it repeatedly: You ask me. Thereupon 'Abdullah b. Hudhafa stood up and said: Allah's Messenger, who is my father? He said: Your father is Hudhafa, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said repeatedly: Ask me, and (it was at this juncture that 'Umar knelt down and said): We are well pleased with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our code of life and with Muhammad as the Messenger (of Allah). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept quiet so long as 'Umar spoke. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: (The Doom) is near; by Him, in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, there was presented to me the Paradise and Hell in the nook of this enclosure, and I did not see good and evil like that of the present day. Ibn Shihab reported: Ubaidullah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba told me that the mother of 'Abdullah b. Hudhafa told 'Abdullah b. Hudhafa: I have never heard of a son more disobedient than you. Do you feel yourself immune from the fact that your mother committed a sin which the women in the pre-Islamic period committed and then you disgrace her in the eyes of the people? 'Abdullah b. Hudhafa said: If my fatherhood were to be attributed to a black slave I would have connected myself with him.

Then a person in the mosque broke the ice and they used to dispute with him by attributing his fatherhood to another man than his own father. He said: Allah's Apostle, who is my father? He said: Your father is Hudhafa. Then 'Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) dared say something and said: We are well pleased with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our code of life and with Muhammad as our Messenger, seeking refuge with Allah from the evil of Turmoil. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Never did I see the good and evil as today. Paradise and Hell were given a visible shape before me (in this worldly life) and I saw both of them near this well.

They said: They are grafting, i. e. they combine the male with the female (tree) and thus they yield more fruit. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I do not find it to be of any use. The people were informed about it and they abandoned this practice. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (was later) on informed (that the yield had dwindled), whereupon he said: If there is any use of it, then they should do it, for it was just a personal opinion of mine, and do not go after my personal opinion; but when I say to you anything on behalf of Allah, then do accept it, for I do not attribute lie to Allah, the Exalted and Glorious.
2362 | Rafi' b. Khadij reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to Medina and the people had been grafting the trees. He said:What are you doing? They said: We are grafting them, whereupon he said: It may perhaps be good for you if you do not do that, so they abandoned this practice (and the date-palms) began to yield less fruit. They made a mention of it (to the Holy Prophet), whereupon he said: I am a human being, so when I command you about a thing pertaining to religion, do accept it, and when I command you about a thing out of my personal opinion, keep it in mind that I am a human being. 'Ikrima reported that he said something like this.

He had come in a land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with Sara. She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these people were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell them that you are my sister and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): 'There comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess', so he (the king) sent someone (towards her) and she was brought to him, and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in prayer. When she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: 'Supplicate to Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you.' She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly than on the first occasion. He said the same thing to her again, and she again did that (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: 'Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by Allah I shall do no harm to you.' She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: 'You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn them out from my land,' and he gave Hajar as a gift to her. She returned (along with Hajar) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: 'How have you returned?' She said: 'With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that debauch and he gave me a maid-servant.' Abu Huraira said: 'O sons of the rain of the sky, she is your mother.'
339.02 | Hammam b. Munabbih reported that Abu Huraira reported many ahadith from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and one, of them speaks that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is reported to have said:Banu Isra'il used to take bath (together) naked and thus saw private parts of one another, but Moses (peace be upon him) used to take bath alone (in privacy), and they said: By Allah, nothing prevents Moses to take bath along with us; but scrotal hernia. One day when he (Moses) was taking bath (alone) he placed his clothes upon a stone, but the stone began to move along with his clothes. Moses raced after it saying: My garment, stone; until (some of the people) of Banu Isra'il looked at the private parts of Moses, and they said: By Allah, there is no trouble with Moses. The stone stopped after he (Moses) had been seen. He took hold of his garments and struck the stone. Abu Huraira said: I swear by Allah that there were six or seven scars on the stone because of the striking of stone by Moses (peace be upon him).
339.03 | Abu Huraira reported that Moses was a modest person. He was never seen naked and Banu Isra'iI said:(He was afraid to expose his private part) because he had been suffering from scrotal hernia. He (one day) took bath in water and placed his garments upon a stone. The stone began to move on quickly. He followed that and struck it with the help of a stone (saying): O stone, my garment; O stone, my garments, O stone; until it stopped near the big gathering of Isrii'll, and this verse was revealed (pertaining to the incident):" O you who believe, be not Iike those who maligned Moses, but Allah cleared him of what they said, and he was worthy of regard with Allah" (xxxiii. 69).
2372.01 | Abu Huraira reported that the Angel of Death was sent to Moses (peace be upon him) to inform of his Lord's summons. When he came, he (Moses) boxed him and his eye was knocked out. He (the Angel of Death) came back to the Lord and said:You sent me to a servant. who did not want to die. Allah restored his eye to its proper place (and revived his eyesight), and then said: Go back to him and tell him that if he wants life he must place his hand on the back of an ox, and he would be granted as many years of life as the number of hair covered by his hand. He (Moses) said: My Lord what would happen then He said: Then you must court death. He said: Let it be now. And he supplicated Allah to bring him close to the sacred land. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: If I were there, I would have shown you his grave beside the road at the red mound.
2372.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said that the Angel of Death came to Moses and said:Respond (to the call) of Allah (i. e. be prepared for death). Moses (peace be upon him) gave a blow at the eye of the Angel of Death and knocked it out. The Angel went back to Allah (the Exalted) and said: You sent me to your servant who does not like to die and he knocked out my eye. Allah restored his eye to its proper place (and revived his eyesight) and said: Go to My servant and say: Do you want life? And in case you want life, keep your hand on the body of the ox and you would live such number of years as the (number of) hair your hand covers. He (Moses) said: What, then? He said: Then you would die, whereupon he (Moses) said: Then why not now? (He then prayed): Allah, cause me to die close to the sacred land. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Had I been near that place I would have shown his grave by the side of the path at the red mound.

He (the Jew) said: By Allah, Who chose Moses (peace be upon him) among mankind. A person from the Ansar heard it and gave a blow at his face saying: (You have the audacity) to say: By Him Who chose Moses amongst mankind, whereas Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is living amongst us. The Jew went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Abu'l-Qasim, I am a Dhimmi and (thus need your protection) by a covenant, and added: Such and such person has given a blow upon my face. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Why did you give a blow on his face? He said: Allah's Messenger, this man said: By Him Who chose Moses (peace be upon him) amongst mankind, whereas you are living amongst us. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) became angry and signs of anger could be seen on his face, and then said: Don't make distinction amongst the Prophets of Allah. When the horn will be blown and whatever is in the heavens and the earth would swoon but he whom Allah grants exception, then another horn will be blown and I would be the first amongst those who would recover and Moses (peace be upon him) would be catching hold of the Throne and I do not know whether it is a compensation for that when he swooned on the Day of Tur or he would be resurrected before me and I do not say that anyone is more excellent than Yunus son of Matta (peace he upon him).

The Jew went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and told him about his affair and the affair of the Muslim. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Don't make me superior to Moses for mankind will swoon and I would be the first to recover from it and Moses would be at that time seizing the side of the Throne and I do not know (whether) he would swoon and would recover before me or Allah would make an exception for him.
2373.04 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:A person from amongst the Muslims and a person from amongst the Jews fell into dispute and reviled each other. The rest of the hadith is the same.

2378 | Abu Huraira reported:It was said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as to who was the most worthy of respect amongst people. He said: The most God-conscious amongst you They said: It is not this that we are asking about, whereupon he said: Then he is Yusuf, the Apostle of Aliah and the son of Allah's Apostle, Ya'qub, who was also the son of Allah's Apostle, the friend of Allah (Ibrahim) They said: This is not what we are asking you. He said: You mean the tribes of Arabia? Those who are good in pre-Islamic days are good in Islam (after embracing Islam) when they get an understanding of it.
2379 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Zakariyya (peace be upon him) was a carpenter.
2380.01 | Sa'id b. Jubair reported:I said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses (peace be upon him), the Apostle of Bani Isra'il, was not the same who accompanied Khadir, whereupon he said: The enemy of Allah tells a lie. I heard Ubayy b. Ka'b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Isra'il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha'). Joshua b. Nun and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha') until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his young companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don't you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fish and nothing made me forget it but Satan that I could not remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra'il? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah's knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of them talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them. They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between me and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa'id b. Jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.
2380.02 | Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn 'Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Isra'il. He said:Sa'id, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact.
2380.03 | Ubayy b. Ka'b narrated to us that he had heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it'? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us. They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-'Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa 'Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Isra'il. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don't ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold'of one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,... up to the last verse.

There happened to pass Ubayy b. Ka'b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said:Abu Tufail, come to us. There has been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah's meesenger (ﷺ) making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah's Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra'il, there came to him a person and he said to him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah revealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wished him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don't you see that as we had reached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except that Yunus (the narrator) said that he followed the traces of fish in the ocean.

By Allah, I hoped that Allah would keep you and your two associates together. I had often heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: I came and there came too Abu Bakr and 'Umar; I entered and there entered too Abu Bakr and 'Umar; I went out and there went out too Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and I hope and think that Allah will keep you along with them.

Then Umar (addressing the women) said: O ye enemies of yourselves, do you fear me and fear not the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? They said: Yes, you are harsh and strict as compared to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Thereupon, Allah's Messenger (maypeace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if satan would encounter you in the way he would certainly take a different way from that of yours.

He was a hypocrite and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said prayer over him that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed the verse:" And never pray over any one of them that has died and never should you stand by his grave" (ix. 84).

Then Umar sought permission and it was given to him in that very state and, after having his need fulfilled, he went back. And 'Uthman reported:Then I sought permission from him and he got up and raid to A'isha: Wrap yourself well with your cloth, then I got my need fulfilled and came back. And A'isha said: Allah's Messenger, why is it that I did not see you feeling any anxiety in case of dressing properly in the presence of Abu Bakr and 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) as you showed in case of 'Uthman. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Verily Uthman is a person who is very modest and I was afraid that if I permitted him to enter in this very state he would not inform me of his need.

He said: I went away and, lo, it was 'Umar. I opened it for him and gave him the glad tidings of Paradise. Then still another man asked for the door to be opened, and thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Open it and give him the glad tidings of Paradise after a trial would afflict him. I went and, lo, it was 'Uthman b. 'Affan. 1 opened the door and gave him the glad tidings of Paradise and informed him (what the Prophet had said). Thereupon he said: O Allah, grant me steadfastness. Allah is one Whose help is to be sought.

2403.03 | Abu Musa Ash'ari reported that he performed ablution in his house and then came out saying:I would remain with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the whole day long. He came to the mosque, and asked about Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). They (his Companions) said: He has gone in this direction. He (Abu Musa Ash'ari) said: I followed his steps asking about him until I came to Bi'r Aris (it is a well in the suburb of Medina). I sat by its wooden door until Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had relieved himself and then performed ablution. I went to him and he was sitting with his shanks uncovered hp to the knees and his legs dangl- ing in that well. I offered him salutations. I then came back and sat at the door as if I had been a chamberlain at the door of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that day. There came Abu Bakr and knocked the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Abu Bakr. I said: Wait, please. I went and said: Allah's Messenger, here is Abu Bakr seeking permission. Thereupon he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings of Paradise. I came and I said to Abu Bakr to get in (and also told him) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was giving him the glad tidings of Paradise. Abu Bakr got in and sat on the right side of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and dangled his feet in the well as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done, and he uncovered his shanks. I then returned and sat there and I had left my brother as he had been performing ablution and he was to meet me and I said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such he would intend goodness for his brother and He would bring him. I was thinking this that a person stirred the door. I said: Who is it. He said: This is Umar b., Khattab. I said: Wait. Then I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), greeted him and said: Here is 'Umar seeking your. permission to get in. Thereupon he said: Let him come in and give him glad tid- ings of Paradise. I came to Umar and said: There is permission for you and glad tidings for you from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for Paradise. He got in and sat on the left side of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with his feet dangling in the well. I then returned and sat and said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such (that is for his brother), He would bring him. And I was contemplat- ing over it that a man stirred the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Uthman b. Affan. I said: Wait, please. I then came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed him. and he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings (and inform) him of the turmoil which he shall have to face. I came and said: Get in, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gives you the glad tidings of Paradise along with the trial which you shall have to face. He got in and saw the elevated plan round the well fully occupied. He sat on the other side. Sharik said that Sa'id b. al-Musayyib reported: I drew a conclusion from it that their groves would be (in this very state, the graves of Hadrat Abu Bakr, 'Umar Faruq by the tide of the Prophet [may peace be upon him] and the grave of Hadrat 'Uthman away from their graves).
2403.04 | Abu Musa. reported:I set out with the intention (of meeting) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and came to know that he had gone to the gardens (in the suburb of Medina). I followed him and found him in a garden sitting upon an elevated place round the well with his shanks uncovered which had been dangling in the well. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation that there is no mention of the words of Sa'id: all drew a conclusion from it pertaining to their graves."
2403.05 | Sa'id b. al-Musayyib reported Abu Musa Ash'ari having said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set out one day to the suburbs of Medina for reliev- ing himself. I followed his steps. The rest of the hadith is the same. Ibn Musayyib said:I concluded (from the manner of their sitting) the (order) of their graves. (The three) would be together (the graves of the Holy Prophet, Hadrat Abu Bakr and Hadrat Umar) and that of 'Uthman would be separate (from them).
2404.01 | Amir b Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas reported (on the authority of his father that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) addressing 'Ali said:You are in the same position with relation to me as Aaron (Harun) was in relation to Moses but with (this explicit difference) that there is no prophet after me. Sa'd said: I had an earnest desire to hear it directly from Sa'd, so I met him and narrated to him what (his son) Amir had narrated to me, whereupon he said: Yes, I did hear it. I said: Did you hear it yourself? Thereupon he placed his fingers upon his ears and said: Yes, and if not, let both my ears become deaf.
2404.02 | Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left 'Ali b. Abi Talib behind him (as he proceeded) to the expedition of Tabuk, whereupon he ('Ali) said:Allah's Messenger, are you leaving me behind amongst women and children? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Aren't you satisfied with being unto me what Aaron was unto Moses but with this exception that there would be no prophet after me?
2404.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters.
2404.04 | Amir b. Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas reported on the authority of his father that Muawiya b. Abi Sufyan appointed Sa'd as the Governor and said:What prevents you from abusing Abu Turab (Hadrat 'Ali), whereupon be said: It is because of three things which I remember Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said about him that I would not abuse him and even if I find one of those three things for me, it would be more dear to me than the red camels. I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say about 'Ali as he left him behind in one of his campaigns (that was Tabuk). 'Ali said to him: Allah's Messenger, you leave me behind along with women and children. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: Aren't you satisfied with being unto me what Aaron was unto Moses but with this exception that there is no prophethood after me. And I (also) heard him say on the Day of Khaibar: I would certainly give this standard to a person who loves Allah and his Messenger, and Allah and his Messenger love him too. He (the narrator) said: We had been anxiously waiting for it, when he (the Holy Prophet) said: Call 'Ali. He was called and his eyes were inflamed. He applied saliva to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave him victory.

Umar b. Khattab said: Never did I cherish for leadership but on that day. I came before him with the hope that I may be called for this, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called 'Ali b. Abu Talib and he conferred (this honour) upon him and said: Proceed on and do not look about until Allah grants you victory, and 'Ali went a bit and then halted and did not look about and then said in a loud voice: Allah's Messenger, on what issue should I fight with the people? Thereupon he (the Prophet) said: Fight with them until they bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his Messenger, and when they do that then their blood and their riches are inviolable from your hands but what is justified by law and their reckoning is with Allah.
2406 | Sahl b. Sa'd reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said on the Day of Khaibar:I would certainly give this standard to a person at whose hand Allah would grant victory and who loves Allah and His Messenger and Allah and His Messenger love him also. The people spent the night thinking as to whom it would be given. When it was morning the people hastened to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) all of them hoping that that would be given to him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Where is 'Ali b. Abu Talib? They said: Allah's Messenger, his eyes are sore. He then sent for him and he was brought and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) applied saliva to his eyes and invoked blessings and he was all right, as if he had no ailment at all, and conferred upon him the standard. 'Ali said: Allah's Messenger, I will fight them until they are like us. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Advance cautiously until you reach their open places, thereafter invite them to Islam and inform them what is obligatory for them from the rights of Allah, for, by Allah, if Allah guides aright even one person through you that is better for you than to possess the most valuable of the camels.

Akwa' reported that it was 'Ali whom Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) left behind him (in the charge of his family and the Islamic State) on the occasion of the campaign of Khaibar, and his eyes were inflamed and he said:Is it for me to remain behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? So he went forth and rejoined Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and on the evening of that night (after which) next morning Allah granted victory. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I will certainly give this standard to a man whom Allah and His Messenger love. or he said: Who loves Allah or His Messenger and Allah will grant him victory through him, and, lo, we saw 'Ali whom we least expected (to be present on that occasion). They (the Companions) said: Here is 'Ali. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon hin) gave him the standard. Allah granted victory at his hand.
2408.01 | Yazid b. Hayyan reported, I went along with Husain b. Sabra and 'Umar b. Muslim to Zaid b. Arqam and, as we sat by his side, Husain said to him:Zaid. you have been able to acquire a great virtue that you saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) listened to his talk, fought by his side in (different) battles, offered prayer behind me. Zaid, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zaid, narrate to us what you heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He said: I have grown old and have almost spent my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in connection with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), so accept whatever I narrate to you, and which I do not narrate do not compel me to do that. He then said: One day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up to deliver sermon at a watering place known as Khumm situated between Mecca and Medina. He praised Allah, extolled Him and delivered the sermon and. exhorted (us) and said: Now to our purpose. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Lord and I, in response to Allah's call, (would bid good-bye to you), but I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren't his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they? Thereupon he said: 'Ali and the offspring of 'Ali, 'Aqil and the offspring of 'Aqil and the offspring of Ja'far and the offspring of 'Abbas. Husain said: These are those for whom the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. Zaid said: Yes.

He who holds it fast would be on right guidance and he who abandons it would be in error, and in this (hadith) these words are also found: We said: Who are amongst the members of the household? Aren't the wives (of the Holy Prophet) included amongst the members of his house hold? Thereupon he said: No, by Allah, a woman lives with a man (as his wife) for a certain period; he then divorces her and she goes back to her parents and to her people; the members of his household include his ownself and his kith and kin (who are related to him by blood) and for him the acceptance of Zakat is prohibited.

He (the governor) said to him: Narrate to us the story of his being named as Abu Turab. He said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to the house of Fatima and he did not find `Ali in the house; whereupon he said: Where is your uncle's son? She said: (There cropped up something) between me and him which had annoyed him with me. He went out and did not rest here. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked a person to find out where he was.

She said: Allah's Messenger, your wives have sent me to you seeking equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She then came to me and showed harshness to me and I was seeing the eyes of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whether he would permit me. Zainab went on until I came to know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would not disapprove if I retorted. Then I exchanged hot words until I made her quiet. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said: She is the daughter of Abu Bakr.
2442.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of wording.
2443 | 'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) during his last illness) inquired:Where I would be tomorrow, where I would be tomorrow (thinking, that the turn of 'A'isha was not very near) and when it was my turn, Allah called him to his Heavenly Home and his head was between my neck and chest.
2444.01 | A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at the time of breathing his last was reclining against her chest and she was leaning over him and listening to him as he was saying:O Allah, grant me pardon, show mercy to me, enjoin me to companions (on High).

2444.03 | 'A'isha reported:I heard that never a prophet dies until he is given an option to opt the life of (this) world or that of the Hereafter. She further said: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say in his last illness in which he' died. I heard him saying in gruffness of the voice: Along with those persons upon whom Allah bestowed favours from amongst the Apostles, the testifiers of truth, the martyrs, the pious and goodly company are they (iv. 69). (It was on bearing these words) that I thought that he had been given choice (and he opted to live with these pious persons in the Paradise).
2444.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sa'd with the same chain of transmitters.
2444.05 | 'A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), reported that he used to say:Never a prophet dies in a state that he is not made to see his abode in Paradise, and then given a choice. 'A'isha said that when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was about to leave the world, his head was over her thigh and he had fallen into swoon three times. When he felt relief his eyes were fixed at the ceiling. He then said: O Allah, along with the high companions (i. e. along with the Apostles who live in the most elevated place of the Paradise). (On hearing these words), I then said (to myself) He is not going to opt us and I remembered a hadith which he had narrated to us as he was healthy and in which he said: No prophet dies until he sees his abode in Paradise, he is then given a choice. 'A'isha said: These were the last words which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) spoke (the words are): O Allah, with companions on High.
2445 | 'A'isha reported that when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set ont on a journey, he used to cast lots amongst his wives. Once this lot came out in my favour and that of Hafsa. They (Hafsi, and 'A'isha) both went along with him and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to travel (on camel) when it was night along with 'A'isha and talked with her. Hafsa said to 'A'isha:Would you like to ride upon my camel tonight and allow me to ride upon your camel and you would see (what you do not generally see) and I would see (what I do not see) generally? She said: Yes. So 'A'isha rode upon the camel of Hafsa and Hafsa rode upon the camel of 'A'isha and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came near the camel of 'A'isha. (whereas) Hafsa had been riding over that. He greeted her and then rode with her until they came down. She ('A'isha) thus missed (the company of the Holy Prophet) and when they sat down, 'A'isha felt jealous. She put her foot in the grass and said: O Allah, let the scorpion sting me or the serpent bite me. And so far as thy Messenger is concerned, I cannot say anything about him.
2446.01 | Anas b. Malik reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The excellence of 'A'isha over women is like the excellence of Tharid over all other foods.

2448.01 | 'A'isha reported that (one day) there sat together eleven women making an explicit promise amongst themselves that they would conceal nothing about their spouses. The first one said:My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor (the meat) is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away (from the top of that mountain). The second one said: My husband (is so bad) that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely. The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow (i. e. he lacks intelligence). If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense (neither completely abandoned by him nor entertained as wife). The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama (the night of Hijaz and Mecca), neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief. The fifth one said: My husband is (like) a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house. The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief. The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both. The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare. The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes (at his door) and his house is near the meeting place and the inn. The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise (of mine). He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they (the camels) hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered. The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara'. How fine Abu Zara' is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart's content. The mother of Abu Zara', how fine is the mother of Abu Zara'! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara' is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara' is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara', obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara', how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the house). She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully (as a sacred trust). And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara' went out (of his house) when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates (chest) under her vest. He divorced me (Umm Zara') and married that woman (whom Abu Zara') met on the way. I (Umm Zara') later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara', make use of everything (you need) and send forth to your parents (but the fact) is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara'. 'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara' was for Umm Zara'.
2448.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Hisham b. 'Urwa but with a slight variation of wording.
2449.01 | Miswar b. Makhramali reported that he heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say, as he sat on the pulpit:The sons of Hisham b. Mughira have asked my permission to marry their daughter with 'Ali b. Abi Talib (that refers to the daughter of Abu Jahl for whom 'All had sent a proposal for marriage). But I would not allow them, I would not allow them, I would not allow them (and the only alternative possible is) that 'Ali should divorce my daughter (and then marry their daughter), for my daughter is part of me. He who disturbs her in fact disturbs me and he who offends her offends me.
2449.02 | Miswar b. Makhramah reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Fatima is a part of me. He in fact tortures me who tortures her.
2449.03 | (Imam Zain-ul-'Abidin) 'Ali b. Husain reported that when they came to Medina from Yazid b. Mu'awiya after the martyrdom of Husain b. 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) Miswar b. Makhramah met him and said to him:Is there any work for me which you ask me to do? I said to him: No. He again said to me: Would you not give me the sword of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for I fear that the people may snatch it from you? By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily 'Ali b. Abi Talib sent a proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl in spite of (the fact that his wife) Fatima (had been living in his house). Thereupon I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say while addressing the people on the pulpit. I was adolescing in those days. He said: Fatima is a part of me and I fear that she may be put to trial in regard to religion. He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been from the tribe of 'Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said: Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me. I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden, but, by Allah, the daaghter of Allah's Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah can never be combined at one place.
2449.04 | 'Ali b. Husain reported that Miswar b. Makhramah informed him that 'Ali b. Abi Talib sent the proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl as he had Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), (as his wife). When Fatima heard about it, she came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said:The people say that you never feel angry on account of your daughters and now 'Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. Makhramah said: Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rose up and I heard him reciting Tashahhud and say: Now to the point. I gave a daughter of mine (Zainab) to Abu'l-'As b. Rabi, and he spoke to me and spoke the truth. Verily Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, is a part of me and I do not approve that she may be put to any trial and by Allah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger cannot be combined with the daughter of God's enemy (as the co-wives) of one person. Thereupon 'Ali gave up (the idea of his intended) marriage.
2449.05 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.
2450.01 | 'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called his daughter Fatima (during his last illness). He said. to her something secretly and she wept. He again said to her something secretly and she laughed. 'A'isha further reported that she said to Fatima:What is that which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to you secretly and you wept and then said to you something secretly and you laughed? Thereupon she said: He informed me secretly of his death and so I wept. He then again informed me secretly that I would be the first amongst the members of his family to follow him and so I laughed.
2450.02 | 'A'isha reported:We, the wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), were with him (during his last illness) and none was absent therefrom that Fatima, who walked after the style of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), came there, and when he saw her he welcomed her saying: You are welcome, my daughter. He their made her sit on his right side or on his left side. Then he said something secretly to her and she wept bitterly and when he found her (plunged) in grief he said to her something secretly for the second time and she laughed. I ('A'isha) said to her: Allah's Messenger has singled you amongst the women (of the family) for talking (to you something secretly) and you wept. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recovered from illness, I said to her. What did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say to you? Thereupon she said: I am not going to disclose the secret of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) died, I said to her: I adjure you by the right that I have upon you that you should narrate to me what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to you. She said: Yes, now I can do that (so listen to it). When he talked to me secretly for the first time he informed me that Gabirel was in the habit of reciting the Qur'an along with him once or twice every year, but this year it had been twice and so he perceived his death quite near, so fear Allah and be patient (and he told me) that he would be a befitting forerunner for me and so I wept as you saw me. And when he saw me in grief he talked to me secretly for the second time and said: Fatima, are you not pleased that you should be at the head of the believing women or the head of this Umma? I laughed and it was that laughter which you saw.
2450.03 | `A'isha reported that all the wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had gathered (in her apartment) during the days of his (Prophet's) last illness and no woman was left behind that Fatima, who walked after the style of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), came there. He welcomed her by saying:You are welcome, my daughter, and made her sit on his right side or on his left side, and then talked something secretly to her and Fatima wept. Then he talked something secretly to her and she laughed. I said to her: What makes you weep? She said: I am not going to divulge the secret of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I (`A'isha) said: I have not seen (anything happening) like today, the happiness being more close to grief (as I see today) when she wept. I said to her: Has Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) singled you out for saying something leaving us aside? She then wept and I asked her what he said, and she said: I am not going to divulge the secrets of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). And when he died I again asked her and she said that he (the Holy Prophet) told her: Gabriel used to recite the Qur'an to me once a year and for this year it was twice and so I perceived that my death had drawn near, and that I (Fatima) would be the first amongst the members of his family who would meet him (in the Hereafter). He shall be my good forerunner and it made me weep. He again talked to me secretly (saying): Aren't you pleased that you should be the sovereign amongst the believing women or the head of women of this Ummah? And this made me laugh.
2451 | Salman reported:In case it lies in your power don't be one to enter the bazar first and the last to get out of that because there is a bustle and the standard of Satan is set there. He said: I was informed that Gabriel (Allah be pleased with him) came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and there was with him Umin Salama and he began to talk with him. He then stood up, whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said to Umm Salama: (Do you know) who was he and what did he say? She said: He was Dihya (Kalbi). He reported Umm Salama having said: By Allah, I did not deem him but only he (Dihya) until I heard the address of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) informing him about us. He (the narrator) said: I said to Uthman: From whom did you hear it? He said: From Usima b. Zaid.
2452 | 'A'isha, the Mother of the Faithful, reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:One who has the longest hands amongst you would meet me most immediately. She farther said: They (the wives of Allah's Apostle) used to measure the hands as to whose hand was the longest and it was the hand of Zainab that was the longest amongst them, as she used to work with her hand and Spend (that income) on charity.
2453 | Anas reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went to Umm Aiman and I went along with him and she served him a drink in a vessel and he reported that the narrator said:I do not know whether it was because of the fasting (or for any other reason) that he (the Holy Prophet) refused to accept that. She raised her voice and showed annoyance to him.
2454 | Anas reported that after the death of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Abu Bakr said to 'Umar:Let us visit Umm Aiman as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to visit her. As we came to her, she wept. They (Abu Bakr and Umar) said to her: What makes you weep? What is in store (in the next world) for Allah's-Messenger (ﷺ) is better than (this worldly life). She said: I weep not because I am ignorant of the fact that what is in store for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (in the next world) is better than (this world), but I weep because the revelation which came from the Heaven has ceased to come. This moved both of them to tears and they began to weep along with her.
2455 | Anas reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) did not enter the house of any woman except that of his wives and that of Umm Sulaim. He used to visit her. It was said to him why it was so, whereupon he said:I feel great compassion for her. Her brother was killed while he was with me.
2456 | Anas reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said:I entered Paradise and heard the noise of steps. I said: Who is it? They said: She is Ghumaisa, daughter of Milhan, the mother of Anas b. Malik.
2457 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:I was shown Paradise and I saw the wife of Abu Talha (i.e. Umm Sulaim) and I heard the noise of steps before me and, lo, it was that of Bilal.
2144.04 | Anas reported that the son of Abu Talba who was born of Umm Sulaim died. She (Umm Sulaim) said to the members of her family:Do not narrate to Abu Talha about his son until I narrate it to him. Abu Talha came (home) ; she presented to him the supper. He took it and drank water. She then embellished herself which she did not do before. He (Abu Talha) had a sexual intercourse with her and when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said: Abu Talha, if some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they resist its return? He said: No. She said: I inform you about the death of your son. He was annoyed, and said: You did not inform me until I had a sexual intercourse with you and you later on gave me information about my son. He went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed him what had happened. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: May Allah bless both of you in the night spent by you! He (the narrator) said: She became pregnant. Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) was in the course of a journey and she was along with him and when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came back to Medina from the journey he did not enter (his house) (during the night). When the people came near Medina, she felt the pangs of delivery. He (Abu Talha) remained with her and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) proceeded on. Abu Talha said: O Lord, you know that I love to go along with Allah's Messenger when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters and I have been detained as Thou seest. Umm Sulaim said: Abu Talha, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling formerly, so better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the pangs of delivery as they reached (Medina) and a child was born and my mother said to me: Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) tomorrow morning. And when it was morning I carried him (the child) and went along with him to Allah's Messenger (may peace beupon him). He said: I saw that he had in his hand the instrument for the cauterisation of the camels. When he saw me. he said: This is, perhaps, what Umm Sulaim has given birth to. I said: Yes. He laid down that instrument on the ground. I brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: See what love the Ansar have for dates. He then wiped his face and named him 'Abdullah.
2144.05 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik through another chain of transmitters.
2458 | Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Bilal:Bilal, narrate to me which act at the time of morning prayer you did in Islam for which you hope to receive good reward, for I heard during the night the sound of your steps before me in Paradise. Bilal said: I did not do any act in Islam for which I hope to get any benefit but this that when I perform complete ablution during the night or day I observe prayer with that purification what Allah has ordained for me to pray.
2459 | Abdullah reported that when this verse was revealed:" There is no harm on persons who believe and perform good acts, what they had eaten (formerly) when they avoided it (now) and they affirmed their faith" (v. 93) up to the end. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me: You are one amongst them.

Thereupon he said: Do you say this (no one can be his rival)? He was admitted (to the company of the Holy Prophet) whereas we were detained and he had been present in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whereas we had been absent.
2461.02 | Abu Ahwas reported:We were in the house of Abu Musa along with some of the companions of 'Abdullah and they were looking at the Holy Book. 'Abdullah stood up, whereupon Abu Mas'ud said: I do not know whether Allah's Messenger, (ﷺ) has left after him one having a better knowledge (of Islam) than the man who is standing. Abu Musa said: If you say this, that is correct, because he had been present when we had been absent and he was permitted when we were detained.
2461.03 | Zaid b. Wahab reported:I was sitting along with Hudhaifa and Abu Musa, and the rest of the hadith is the same.
2462 | 'Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) reported that he (said to his companions to conceal their copies of the Qur'an) and further said:He who conceals anything he shall have to bring that which he had concealed on the Day of judgment, and then said: After whose mode of recitation you command me to recite? I in fact recited before AIlah's Messenger (ﷺ) more than seventy chapters of the Qur'an and the Companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) know it that I have better understanding of the Book of Allah (than they do), and if I were to know that someone had better understanding than I, I would have gone to him. Shaqiq said: I sat in the company of the Companions of Mubkmmad (ﷺ) but I did not hear anyone having rejected that (that is, his recitation) or finding fault with it.
2463 | Abdullah reported:By Him besides Whom there is no god, there is no chapter in the Book of Allah about which I do not know as to where it was revealed and there is no verse about which I do not know in what context it was revealed, and if I were to know of one having a better understanding of the Book of Allah than I (and I could reach him) on the back of the mule, I would have definitely gone to him on camel's back.
2464.01 | Masruq reported:We used to go to Abdullah b. 'Amr and talk to him, Ibn Numair said: One day we made a mention of Abdullah b. Mas'ud, whereupon he said: You have made mention of a person whom I love more than anything else. I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Learn Qur'an from four persons: Ibn Umm 'Abd (i. e.

All the persons stretched their hands saying: I would do it, I would do it. He (Allah's Apostle) said: Who would take it in order to fulfil its rights? Then the people withdrew their hands. Simak b. Kharasha Abu Dujana said: I am here to take it and fulfil its rights. He took it and struck the heads of the polytheists.
2471.01 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:The dead body of my father was brought and he was covered (with cloth) and it had been mutilated. I made an attempt to lift the cloth, but my people prohibited me to do so. I again made an attempt to lift the cloth, but my people prohibited me. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) lifted it or he commanded it to be lifted. He heard the noise (of a loud) weeping, or the noise of a woman mourner. He inquired who she was. They said: The daughter of 'Amr or the sister of Amr, whereupon he said: Why does she weep? The Angels provide him shade with the help of their Wings until he would be lifted (to his heavenly abode)
2471.02 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:My father fell as a martyr on the Day of Uhud and I attempted to uncover his face and weep, but they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) forbade me to do this, whereas Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not forbid me and Fatima bint Amr, the sister of my father, was also weeping There- upon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: You may weep or you may not weep; the Angels provide him shade with the help of their wings until you lift him (to be buried in the grave).
2471.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jabir through another chain of transmitters, but with this difference that there is no mention of the Angels and the weeping of a female mourner.
2471.04 | Jabir reported:My father was brought in a state that his ears had been cut off and (his dead body) was placed before Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), the rest of the hadith is the same.
2472 | Abu Barza reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) was there in a battlefield that Allah conferred upon him the spoils of war. He said to his Companions:Is anyone missing amongst you? They said: So and so and so. He again said: Is there anyone missing amongst you? They said: So and so and so. He then said: Is there anyone missing amongst you? They said: No. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: But I am missing Julaibib. They (his Companions) searched him amongst those who had been killed and they found him by the side of seven (dead bodies) whom he had killed and he had been killed (by the oppoments). Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came there and stood (by his side) and said: He killed seven (persons). Then (his opponents) killed him. He is mine and I am his. He then placed him upon his hands and there was none else to lift but Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). Then the grave was dug for him and he was placed in the grave and no mention is made of a bath.
2473.01 | 'Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said:We set out from our tribe Ghafir who look upon the prohibited months as permissible months. I and my brother Unais and our mother stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell jealous and they said: When you are anay from your house, Unais commits adultery with your wife. Our -naternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin which was conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we encamped by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (Abu Dharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here. Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na'ila (the two idols). They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols' private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka'ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in this way; Allah's Messen- ger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar. I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah's Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along with them. Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta'if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah's Messenaer (ﷺ) and he said: I have been shown the land abound- ing in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the prophethood of Allah's Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi' b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah's Messenger (may p,. ace be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.
2473.02 | This hadlth has been narrated on the authority of Humaid b. Hilal with the same chain of transmitters but with this addition:" As I came to Mecca, Unais said: (Well), go but be on your guard against the Meccans for they are his enemies and are annoyed with him."
2473.03 | Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said:Son of my brother, I used to observe prayer two years before the advent of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). I said: To which direction did you turn your face? He said: To which Allah directed me to turn my face. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this addition that they went to a Kahin and his brother Unais began to praise him until he (in verses declared) him (Unais) as winner (in the contest of poetry), and so we got his camels, mixed them with our camels, and there is in this hadith also these words that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came there and he circumambulated the House and observed two Rak'ahs of prayer behind the Station (of Ibrahim). I came to him and I was the first amongst persons to greet him with Assalam-o-'Alaikum, and I said to Allah's Messenger Let there be peace upon you. And he said: Let there be peace upon you too; who are you? And in the hadith (these words are) also found: Since how long have you been here? And Abu Bakr said: Let him be my guest tonight.
2474 | Ibn `Abbas reported that when Abu Dharr heard of the advent of the Apostle (ﷺ) in Mecca he said:Brother, ride in this valley and bring information for me about the person who claims that there comes to him information from the Heavens. Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and a small water-skin containing water (and set forth) until he came to Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka`bah) and began to look for Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he did not recognize him (the Holy Prophet) and he did not even like that he should ask about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept. `Ali saw him and found him to be a stranger. So he went with him. He followed him but one did not make any inquiry from the other about anything until it was morning. He then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he did not see Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) until it was night. He then returned to his bed, and there happened to pass `Ali and he said: This man has not been able to find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an inquiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. `Ali made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don't you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He (`Ali) said: Verily, he is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and when it is morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you I would stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He entered (the house) of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) along with him and listened to his words and embraced Islam at this very place. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said to him: Go to your people and inform them until my command reaches you. Thereupon he said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I shall say to the people of Mecca this thing at the top of my voice. So he set forth until he came to the mosque and then spoke at the top of his voice (saying): I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The people attacked him and made him fall down when al-`Abbas came and he leaned over him and said: Woe be upon you, don't you know that he is from amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trading route to Syria passes through (the settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him. He (Abu Dharr) did the same on the next day and they (the Meccans) again attacked him and al-`Abbas leaned upon him and he rescued him.
2475.01 | (6050) Jarir b. 'Abdullah said:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never refused me permission to see him since I embraced Islam and never looked at me but with a smile.
2475.02 | Jarir reported:Since I embraced Islam Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never refused to see me and he did not see me but with a smile on his face. Ibn Numair has made this addition to this hadith which has been reported on the authority of Ibn Idris that he (Jarir) made this complaint to him (to the Holy Prophet): I cannot sit upon the horse with firmness, whereupon he (Allah's Apostle) struck his chest with his hand and prayed: O Allah, make him steadfast and rightly-guided.
2476.01 | Jabir reported that there was in pre-Islamic days a temple called Dhu'l- Khalasah and it was called the Yamanite Ka'ba or the northern Ka'ba. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said unto me:Will you rid me of Dhu'l-Khalasah and so I went forth at the head of 350 horsemen of the tribe of Ahmas and we destroyed it and killed whomsoever we found there. Then we came back to him (to the Holy Prophet) and informed him and he blessed us and the tribe of Ahmas.
2476.02 | Jarir b. 'Abdullah al-Bajali said:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me: Can't on rid me of Dhu'I-Khalasah, the idol-house of Khath'am, and this idol-house was called the Yamanite Ka'ba. So I went along with 150 horsemen and I could not sit with steadfastness upon the horse. I made the mention of it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he struck his hand on my chest and said: O Allah, grant him steadfastness and make him the guide of righteousness and the rightly-guided one. So he went away and he set fire to it. Then Jarir sent some person to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whose Kunya was Abu Arta to give him the happy news about that. He came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: I have not come to you (but with the news) that we have left Dhu'l-Khalasah as a scabed camel. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) blessed the horses of Ahmas and the men of their tribe five times.
2476.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ismail with different chains of transmitters and in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Marwan (the words are):"A person giving the glad tidings on behalf of Jarir came or Abu Husain b. Rabi`a came in order to give glad tidings to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ)."
2477 | Ibn 'Abbas reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to privy and I placed for him water for ablution, When he came out he said:Who placed it here? And in a version of Zuhair they (the Companions) said, and in the version of Abu Bakr (the words are): I said: It is Ibn 'Abbas (who has done that), whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: May Allah grant him deep understanding of religion.
2478 | Ibn 'Umar reported:I saw in a state of sleep as if I have in my hand a piece of silk cloth and there is no place in the Paradise where I intend to reach but that piece of cloth does not fly towards it. I made a mention of it to Hafsa (the sister of Ibn 'Umar) and Hafsa made a mention of it to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: I find 'Abdullah b 'Umar a pious person.
2479.01 | Ibn 'Umar reported that when a person saw anything in sleep during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) he narrated it to Allah's Messenger, and I also had a longing that I should also see in a dream something which I should narrate to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and I was at that time an unmarried young man. I was sleeping in the mosque during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) tl) at I saw in a dream as if two Angels have taken hold of me and they have carried me to the fire, and, lo, it was built like the easing of a well and had two pillars like those of a well; and, lo, there were people in it whom I knew and I cried out:I seek refuge with Allah from Hell-fire; I seek refuge with Allah from Hell-fire. Then another Angel joined the two others, and said unto me: You need not fear I narrated this dream to llafsa and she narrated it to Allah's Messenger, whereupon Allah's Apostle said: Worthy is this man Abdullah, O that he would pray at night, and Silim added that Abdullah afterwards slept only but for a small part of the night.
2479.02 | Ibn Umar reported:I used to spend nights in the mosque and by that time I had no wife and children. I saw in a dream as if I am being taken to a well. I made a mention of it to Allah's Messenger (may peacebe upon him). The rest of the hadith is the same.
2480.01 | Anas reported that Umm Sulaim said (to the Holy Prophet) Allah's Messenger, here is your servant Anas, invoke blessings of Allah upon him. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said:O Allah, make an increase in his wealth, and progeny, and confer blessings upon him in everything Thou hast bestowed upon him.
2480.02 | Anas reported (that his mother) Umm Sulaim said (to the Holy Prophet) Allah's Messenger, here is your servant Anas. The rest of the hadith is the same.
2480.03 | This hadith has been reported on the authority of Anas through another chain of transmitters.
2481.01 | Anas reportedAllah's Apostle (ﷺ) visited us and there was none else (in the house) but I, my mother and my mother's sister Umm Haram. My mother said to him:Allah's Messenger, here is a small servant of yours, invoke blessings of Allah upon him. And he invoked blessings for me (that I should be bestowed upon) every good and this was what he (said) at the end of what be supplicated for me: O Allah, make an increase in his wealth, and progeny, and cqnfer blessings (upon him) in (each one) of them.
2481.02 | Anas reported:My mother Umm Anas came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). And she prepared my lower garment out of the half of her headdress and (with the other half) she covered my upper body and said: Allah's Messenger, here is my son Unais; I have brought him to you for serving you. Invoke blessings of Allah upon him. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: O Allah, make an increase in his wealth, and progeny. Anas said: By Allah, my fortune is huge and my children, and grand-children are now more than one hundred.
2481.03 | Anas b. Malik said:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) passed (by our house) that my mother Umm Sulaim listened to his voice and said: Allah's Messenger, let my father and mother be sacrificed for thee, here is Unais (and requested him to invoke blessings upon me). So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) invoked three blessings upon me. I have seen (the results) of the two in this very world (in regard to wealth and progeny) and I hope to see (the result) of the third one in the Hereafter.
2482.01 | Anas reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me as I was playing with playmates. He greeted and sent me on an errand and I made delay in going to my mother. When I came to her she said: What detained you? I said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent me on an errand. She said: What was the purpose? I said: It is something secret. Therupon she said: Do not then divulge the secret of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to anyone. Anas said: By Allah, if I were to divulge it to anyone, then, O Thabit, I would have divulged it to you.
2482.02 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) told me something secretly. I informed none about that and Umm Sulaim asked me about it, but I did not tell her even.
2383 | 'Amir b. Sa'd reported that he heard his father (Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas) say:never heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say unto one living and moving about that he was in Paradise except to 'Abdullah b. Salim.
2484.01 | Qais b. 'Ubada reported:I was in the company of some persons, amongst whom some were the Companions of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) in Medina, that there came a person whose face depicted the fear (of Allah). Some people said: He is a person from amongst the people of Paradise; he is a person from amongst the people of Paradise. He observed two short rak'ahs of prayer and then went out. I followed him and he got into his house and I also got in and we began to converse with each other. And when he became familiar (with me) I said to Him: When you entered (the mosque) before (your entrance in the house) a person said so and so (that you are amongst the people of Paradise), whereupon he said: It is not meet for anyone to say anything which he does not know. I shall (now) tell you why they (say) this. I saw a dream during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and narrated it to him. I seemed to be in a garden [he described its vastness, its rich fructification and its verdure]; in the midst of it, there stood an iron pillar, with its base in the earth and its summit in the sky: and upon its summit there was a handhold. It was said to me: Climb up this (pillar). I said to him (visitant in the dream): I am unable to do it. Thereupon a helper came to me, and he (supported) me (by catching hold of my) garment from behind and thus helped me with his hand and so I climbed up till I was at the summit of the pillar, and grasped the handhold. It was said to me: Ho d it tightly. It was at this that I woke up when (the handhold) was in fthe grip) of my hand. I narrated it (the dream) to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), whereupon he said: That garden implies al-Islam and that pillar implies the pillar of Islam. And that handhold is the firmest faith (as refered to in the Qur'an). And you will remain attached to Islam until you shall die. And that man was 'Abdullah b. Salim.
2484.02 | Qais b. 'Ubaida reported:I was (sitting) in a company in which there were (besides others) Sa'd b. Malik and Ibn 'Umar that 'Abdullah b. Saliim happened to pass (by that side). They (the people sitting in that company) said: He is a person from amongst the dwellers of Paradise. I stood up and said to him: They say such and such (thing about you), whereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, it is not meet for them to say (anything) of which They have no knowledge. Verily I saw as if a pillar had been raised in a green garden and there had been fixed at its (upper) end a handhold and there was a helper at its base. It was said to me: Climb up. So I climbed up and caught hold of the haildhold. I narrated (the contents of this dream) to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whereupon he said: 'Abdullah would die in a state that he would be catching hold of the firmest handhold (he would die holding fast to the faith).
2484.03 | Kharasha b. Hurr reported:I was sitting in a circle in the mosque of Medina and there was an old man, quite handsome. He was 'Abdullah b. Salim. He was telling good things to them (to the people sitting in that company). As he stood up (to depart) the people said: He who is desirous of looking at a person from amongst the people of Paradise should see him. I said: By Allah, I will follow him, and would try to know his residence. So I followed him and he walked on until he reached the outskirts of Medina. He then entered his house. I sought permission from him to get in, and he granted me the permission, saying: My nephew, what is the need (that has brought you here)? I said to him: As you stood up, I heard people say about you: He who is desirous of seeing a person from among the people of Paradise should look at him. So I became desirous of accompanying you. He ('Abdullah b. Salim) said: It is Allah Who knows best about the people of Paradise. I would, however, narrate to you as to why they said like it. (The story is) that while I was asleep (one night) there came to me a person (in the dream) who asked me to stand up. (So I stood up) and he caught hold of my hand and I walked along with him, and, lo, I found some paths on my left and I was about to set out upon them. Thereupon he said to me Do not set yourself on (them) for these are the paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell-fire). Then there were paths leading to the right side, whereupon he said: Set yourself on these paths. We came across a hill and he said to me: Climb up, and I attempted to climb up that I fell upon my buttocks. I made several attempts (but failed to succeed). He led until he came to a pillar (so high) that its upper end touched the sky and its base was in the earth. And there was a handhold at its upper end. He said to me Climb over it. I said: How can I climb upon it, as its upper end touches the sky? He cought hold of my hand and pushed me up and I found myself suspended with the handhold. He then struck the pillar and it fell down, but I remained attached to that handhold until it was morning (and the dream was thus over). I came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and narrated it to him. He said: So far as the paths which you saw on your left are concerned, these are paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell) and the paths which you saw on your right, these are the paths of the rightists (the dwellers of Paradise) and the mountain represents the destination of the martyrs which you would not be able to attain. The pillar implies the pillar of Islam. and so far as the handhold is concerned, it implies the handhold of Islam, and you would hold to it fastly until you would meet death.
2485.01 | Abu Huraira reported that 'Umar happened to pass by Hassan as he was reciting verses in the mosque. He (Hadrat 'Umar) looked towards him (meaningfully), whereupon he (gassin) said:I used to recite (verses) when one better than you (the Holy Prophet) had been present (here). He then looked towards Abu Huraira and said to him: I adjure you by Allah (to tell) if you had not heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: (Hassan), give a reply on my behalf; Allah I help him with Ruh-ul-Qudus. He (Abu Huraira) said: By Allah, it is so (i. e. the Prophet actually said these words).
2485.02 | Ibn Musayyib reported that Hassan said to a circle in which there was also Abu Huraira:Abu Huraira, I adjure you by Allah (to tell) whether you-had not heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying like this.
2485.03 | 'Abd al-Rahman reported that he heard Hassin b. Thabit al-Ansari call Abu Huraira to bear witness by saying:I adjure you by Allah if you had not heard Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) saying: Hassin, give a reply on behalf of the Messenger of Allah. O Allah, help him with Ruh-ul-Qudus. Abu Huraira said: Yes, it is so.
2486.01 | Al-Bari' b. 'Azib reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Hassan b. Thibit, write satire (against the non-believers) ; Gabriel is with you.
2486.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters.
2487.01 | Hisham reported on the authority of his father that Hassan b. Thabit talked much about 'A'isha. I scolded him, whereupon she said:My nephew, leave him for he defended Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
2487.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Hishim with the same chain of transmitters.
2488.01 | Masruq reported:I visited 'A'isha when Hassin was sitting there and reciting verses from his compilation: She is chaste and prudent. There is no calumny against her and she rises up early in the morning without eating the meat of the un- mindful. 'A'isha said: But you are not so. Masruq said: I said to her: Why do you permit him to visit you, whereas Allah has said:" And as for him among them who took upon himself the main part thereof, he shall have a grievous punishment" (XXIV. ll)? Thereupon she said: What tornient can be more severe than this that he has become blind? He used to write satire as a rebuttal on behalf of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
2488.02 | This hadith has been reported on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.
2489.01 | 'A'isha reported that Hassin said:Allah's Messenger, permit me to write satire against Abu Sufyan, whereupon he said: How can it be because I am also related to him? Thereupon he (Hassan) said: By Him Who has honoured you. I shall draw you out from them (their family) just as hair is drawn out from the fermented (flour). Thereupon Hassan said: The dignity and greatness belongs to the tribe of Bint Makhzum from amongst the tribe of Hisham, whereas your father was a slave.
2489.02 | 'Urwa reported on the same chain of transmitters that Hassan b. Thabit sought permission from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) to satirise against the polytheists, but he did not mention Abu Sufyan. And instead of the word al- Khamir, the word al-'Ajin was used.
2490 | 'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be uport him) said. Satirise against the (non-believing amongst the) Quraish, for (the satire) is more grievous to them than the hurt of an arrow. So he (the Holy Prophet) sent (someone) to Ibn Rawiha and asked him to satirise against them, and he composed a satire, but it did not appeal to him (to the Holy Prophet). He then sent (someone) to Ka'b b. Malik (to do the same, but what he composed did not appeal to the Holy Prophet). He then sent one to Hassan b. Thabit. As he got into his presence, Hassan said:Now you have called for this lion who strikes (the enemies) with his tail. He then brought out his tongue and began to move it and said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I shall tear them with my tongue as the leather is torn. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Don't be hasty; (let) Abu Bakr who has the best know- ledge of the lineage of the Quraish draw a distinction for you in regard to my lineage, as my lineage is thesame as theirs. Hassan then came to him (Abu Bakr) and after making inquiry (in regard to the lineage of the Holy Prophet) came back to him (the holy Prophet) and said: Allah's Messenger, he (Abu Bakr) has drawn a distinction in vour lineage (and that of the Quraish) By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I shall draw out from them (your name) as hair is drawn out from the flour. 'A'isha said: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying to Hassin: Verily Ruh-ul- Qudus would continue to help you so long as you put up a defence on behalf of Allah and His Messenger. And she said: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying: Hassan satirised against them and gave satisfaction to the (Muslims) and disquieted (the non-Muslims). You satirised Muhammad, but I replied on his behalf, And there is reward with Allah for this. You satirised Muhammad. virtuous, righteous, The Apostle of Allah, whose nature is truthfulness. So verily my father and his father and my honour Are a protection to the honour of Muhammad; May I lose my dear daughter, if you don't see her, Wiping away the dust from the two sides of Kada', They pull at the rein, going upward; On their shoulders are spears thirsting (for the blood of the enemy) ; our steeds are sweating-our women wipe them with their mantles. If you had not interfered with us, we would have performed the 'Umra, And (then) there was the Victory, and the darkness cleared away. Otherwise wait for the fighting on the day in which Allah will honour whom He pleases. And Allah said: I have sent a servant who says the Truth in which there is no ambiguity; And Allah said: I have prepared an army-they are the Ansar whose object is fighting (the enemy), There reaches every day from Ma'add abuse, or fighting or satire; Whoever satirises the Apostle from amongst you, or praises him and helps it is all the same, And Gabriel, the Messenger of Allah is among us, and the Holy Spirit who has no match.
2491 | Abu Huraira reported:I invited my mother, who was a polytlieist, to Islam. I invited her one day and she said to me something about Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which I hated. I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) weeping and said: Allah's Messenger, I invited my mother to Islam but she did not accept (my invitation). I invited her today but she said to me something which I did not like. (Kindly) supplicate Allah that He may set the mother of Abu Huraira right. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: O Allah, set the mother of Abu Huraira on the right path. I came out quite pleased with the supplication of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and when I came near the door it was closed from within. My mother heard the noise of my footsteps and she said: Abu Huraira, just wait. And I heard the noise of falling of water. She took a bath and put on the shirt and quickly covered her head with a headdress and opened the door and then said: Abu Huraira, I bear witness to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His bondsman and His Messenger. He (Abu Huraira) said: I went back to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and (this time) I was shedding the tears of joy. I said: Allah's Messenger, be happy, for Allah has responded to your supplication and He has set on the right path the mother of Abu Huraira. He (the Holy Prophet) praised Allah, and extolled Him and uttered good words. I said: Allah's Messenger, supplicate to Allah so that He may instill love of mine and that of my mother too in the believing servants and let our hearts be filled with their love, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: O Allah, let there be love of these servants of yours, i.e. Abu Huraira and his mother, in the hearts of the believing servants and let their hearts be filled with the love of the believing servants. (Abu Huraira said: This prayer) was so well granted by Allah that no believer was ever born who heard of me and who saw me but did not love me.
2492.01 | Al-A'raj reported that he heard Abu Huraira as saying:You are under the impression that Abu Huraira transmits so many ahadith from Allah's Messenger (may peace up upon him) ; (bear in mind) Allah is the great Reckoner. I was a poor man and I served Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) being satisfied with bare subsistence, whereas the immigrants remained busy with transactions in the bazar; while the Ansar had been engaged in looking after their properties. (He further reported) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He who spreads the cloth would not forget anything that he would hear from me. I spread my cloth until he narrated something. I then pressed it against my (chest), so I never forgot anything that I heard from him.
2492.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Huraira but with the variation that the hadith transmitted on the authority of Malik conclude with the words of Abu Huraira and there is no mention of a transmission of these from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ):" who spreads his cloth," to the end.
2493 | 'A'isha reported:Don't you feel surprised at Abu Huraira? He came (one day) and sat beside the nook of my apartment and began to narrate (the hadith of Allah's Apostle). I was hearing while I was engaged in extolling Allah (reciting Subhan Allah) constantly. He stood up before I finished my repetition of Subhan Allah. if I were to meet him I would have warned him in stern words that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not speak so quickly as you talk.
2492.03 | Ibn Shihab transmitted on the authority of Ibn Musayyib that Abu Huraira said:People say that Abu Huraira transmits so many ahadith, whereas Allah is the Reckoner, and they say: How is it with Muhajirs and the Ansar that they do not narrate ahadith like him (like Abu Huraira)? Abu Huraira said: I tell you that my brothers from Ansar remained busy with their lands and my brothers Muhajirs were busy in transactions in the bazars, but I always kept myself attached to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with bare subsistence. I remained present (in the company of the Holy Prophet), whereas they had been absent. I retained in my mind (what the Prophet said), whereas they forgot it. One day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He who amongst you spreads the cloth and listens to my talk and would then press it against his chest would never forget anything heard from me. So I spread my mantle and when he had concluded his talk I then pressed it against my chest and so I never forgot after that day anything that he (the Holy Prophet) said. And if these two verses would not have been revealed in the Book I would have never transmitted anything (to anybody):" Those who conceal the clear evidence and the guidance that We revealed" (ii. 159) tip to the last verse.
2492.04 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Huraira (and the words are):You say that Abu Huraira narrates so many ahadith from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ; the rest of the hadith is the same.
2494.01 | Ubaidullah b. Rafi', who was the scribe of 'All, reported:I heard 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) as saying: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent me and Zubair and Miqdad saying: Go to the garden of, Khakh [it is a place between Medina and Mecca at a distance of twelve miles from Medina] and there you will find a woman riding a camel. She would be in possession of a letter, which you must get from her. So we rushed on horses and when we met that woman, we asked her to deliver that letter to us. She said: There is no letter with me. We said: Either bring out that letter or we would take off your clothes. She brought out that letter from (the plaited hair of) her head. We delivered that letter to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in which Hatib b. Abu Balta'a had informed some people amongst the polytheists of Mecca about the affairs of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Hatib, what is this? He said: Allah's messenger, do not be hasty in judging my intention. I was a person attached to the Quraish. Sufyan said: He was their ally but had no relationship with them. (Hatib further said): Those who are with you amongst the emigrants have blood-relationship with them (the Quraish) and thus they would protect their families. I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with them I should find some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not done this because of any unbelief or apostasy and I have no liking for the unbelief after I have (accepted) Islam. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: You have told the truth. 'Umar said: Allah's Messenger, permit me to strike the neck of this hypocrite. But he (the Holy Prophet) said: He was a participant in Badr and you little know that Allah revealed about the people of Badr: Do what you like for there is forgiveness for you. And Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:" O you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy for friends" (lx. 1). And there is no mention of this verse in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Bakr and Zubair and Ishaq has in his narration made a mention of the recitation of this verse by Sufyan.
2494.02 | 'Ali reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent me and Abu Marthad al-Ghitnavi and Zubair b. 'Awwam and we were all riders, and he said:Ride on until you reach the garden of Khakh for there is a woman amongst the polytheists and there is a letter with her sent by Hatib to the polytheists; the rest of the hadith is the same.
2495 | Jabir reported that a slave of Hatib came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) complaining against Hatib and said:Hatib will definitely go to Hell. (But) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: You tell a lie; he would not get into that for he had taken part in Badr and in (the expedition of) Hudaibiya.
2496 | Umm Mubashshir reported that she heard Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying in presence of Hafsa:God willing, the people of the Tree would never enter the fire of Hell one amongst those who owed allegiance under that. She said: Allah's Messenger, why not? He scolded her. Hafsa said: And there is none amongst you but shall have to pass over that (narrow Bridge). Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has said: We would rescue those persons who are God-conscious and we would leave the tyrants to their fate there (xix. 72).
2497 | Abu Musa reported:I was in the company of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as he had been sitting in Ji'rana (a place) between Mecca and Medina and Bilal was also there, that there came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) a desert Arab, and he said: Muhammad, fulfill your promise that you made with me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: Accept glad tidings. Thereupon the desert Arab said: You shower glad tidings upon me very much; then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) turned towards Abu Musa and Bilal seemingly in a state of annoyance and said: Verily he has rejected glad tidings but you two should accept them. We said: Allah's Messenger, we have readily accepted them. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called for a cup of water and washed his hands in that and face too and put the saliva in it and then said: Drink out of it and pour it over your faces and over your chest and gladden yourselves. They took hold of the cup and did as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had commanded them to do. Thereupon Umm Salama called from behind the veil: Spare some water in your vessel for your mother also, and they also gave some water which had been spared for her.
2498 | Abu Burda reported on the authority of his father that when Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had been free from the Battle of Hunain, he sent Abu 'Amir as the head of the army of Autas. He had an encounter with Duraid b. as_Simma. Duraid was killed and Allah gave defeat to his friends. Abu Musa said:He (the Holy Prophet) sent me along with Abu 'Amir and Abu 'Amir received a wound in his knee from the arrow, (shot by) a person of Bani Jusham. It stuck in his knee. I went to him and said: Uncle, who shot an arrow upon you? Abu 'Amir pointed out to Abu Musa and said: Verily that one who shot an arrow upon me in fact killed me. Abu Musa said: I followed him with the determination to kill him and overtook him and when he saw me he turned upon his heels. I followed him and I said to him: Don't you feel ashamed (that you run), aren't you an Arab? Why don't you stop? He stopped and I had an encounter with him and we exchanged the strokes of (swords). I struck him with the sword and killed him. Then I came back to Abu Amir and said: Verily Allah has killed the one who killed you. And he said: Now draw out this arrow. I drew out the arrow and there came out from that (wound) water. Abu 'Amir said: My nephew, go to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and convey my greetings to him and tell him that Abu Amir begs you to ask forgiveness for him. And Abu Amir appointed me as the chief of the people and he died after a short time. When I came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) I visited him and he had been lying on the cot woven by strings and there was (no) bed over it and so there had been marks of the strings on the back of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and on his sides. I narrated to him what had happened to us and narrated to him about Abu Amir and said to him that he had made a request to the effect that forgiveness should be sought for him (from Allah). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be. upon him) called for water and performed ablution with it. He then lifted his hands and said. O Allah, grant pardon to Thy servant Abu Amir. (The Prophet had raised his hands so high for supplication) that I saw the whiteness of his armpits. He again said: O Allah, grant him distinction amongst the majority of Thine created beings or from amongst the people. I said: Allah's Messenger, ask forgiveness for me too. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Allah, forgive the sins of Abdullah b. Qais (Abu Musa Ash'ari) and admit him to an elevated place on the Day of Resurrection. Abu Burda said: One prayer is for abu 'Amir and the other is tor Abu Musa.
2499 | Abu Musa reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:I recognise the voice of the Ash'arites while they recite the Qur'an as they arrive during the night and I also recognise their station from the recital of the Qur'an during the night time, although I have not seen their encampments as they encamp during the day time. And there is a person amongst them, Hakim; when he encounters the horsemen or the enemies he says to them: My friends command you to wait for them.
2500 | Abu Musa reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:When the Ash'arites run short of provisions in the campaigns or run short of food for their children in Medina they collect whatever is with them in the cloth and then partake equally from one vessel. They are from me and I am from them.
2501 | Ibn Abbas reported that the Muslims neither looked to Abu Sufyan (with respect) nor did they sit in his company. he (Abu Sufyan) said to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ):Allah's Apostle, confer upon me three things. He replied in the affirmative. He (further) said: I have with me the most handsome and the best (woman) Umm Habiba, daughter of Abu Sufyan; marry her, whereupon he said: Yes. And he again said: Accept Mu'awiya to serve as your scribe. He said: Yes. He again said: Make me the commander (of the Muslim army) so that I should fight against the unbelievers as I fought against the Muslims. He said: Yes. Abu Zumnail said: If he had not asked for these three things from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), he would have never conferred them upon him, for it was (his habit) to accede to everybody's (earnest) request.
2502 | Abu Musa reported:We were in Yemen when we heard of the migration of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). We also set out as immigrants to him. And I was accompanied by two brothers of mine, I being the youngest of them; one of them was Abu Burda and the other one was Abu Ruhm, and there were some other persons with them. Some say they were fifty-three or fifty-two persons of my tribe. We embarked upon a boat, and the boat sailed away to the Negus of Abyssinia. There we met Ja'far b. Abu Talib and his companions. Ja'far said: Allall's Messenger (ﷺ) has sent us here and has commanded us to stay here and you should also stay with us. So we stayed with him and we came back (to Medina) and met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when Khaibar had been conquered. He (the Holy Prophet) allocated a share to us and in the ordinary course he did not allocate the share to one who had been absent on the occasion of the conquest of Khaibar but conferred (a share) upon him only who had been present there with him. He, however, made an exception for the people of the boat, viz. for Ja'far and his companions. He allocated a share to them, and some persons from amongst the people said to us, viz. the people of the boat: We have preceded you in migration. Asma' bint 'Umais who had migrated to Abyssinia and had come back along with them (along with immigrants) visited Hafsa, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). (Accordingly), Umar had been sitting with her (Hafsa). As 'Umar saw Asma, he said: Who is she? She (Hafsa) said: She is Asma, daughter of 'Umais. He said: She is an Abyssinian and a sea-woman. Asma said: Yes, it is so. Thereupon 'Umar said: We preceded you in migration and so we have more right to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as compared with you. At this she felt annoyed and said: 'Umar, you are not stating the fact; by Allah, you had the privilege of being in the company of the Messenger (ﷺ) who fed the hungry among you and instructed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia amongst the enemies and that was all for Allah and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and, by Allah, I would never take food nor take water unless I make a mention to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what you have said. We remained in that country in constant trouble and dread and I shall talk about it to Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) and ask him (about it). By Allah, I shall not tell a lie and deviate (from the truth) and add anything to that. So, when Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came, she said: Allah's Apostle, 'Umar says so and so. Upon this Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: His right is not more than yours, for him and his companions there is one migration, but for you, i. e. for the people of the boat, there are two migrations. She said: I saw Abu Musa and the people of the boat coming to me in groups and asking me about this hadith, because there was nothing more pleasing and more significant for them than this. Abu Burda reported that Asma said: I saw Abu Musa, asking me to repeat this hadith to him again and again.
2504 | 'A'idh b. Amr reported that Abu Sufyan came to Salman, Suhaib and Bilal in the presence of a group of persons. They said:By Allah, the sword of Allah did not reach the neck of the enemy of Allah as it was required to reach. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Do you say this to the old man of the Quraish and their chief? Then he came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon'him) and informed him of this. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Abu Bakr, you have perhaps annoyed them and if you annoyed them you have in fact annoyed your Lord. So Abu Bakr came to them and said: O my brothers, I have annoyed you. They said: No, our brother, may Allah forgive you
2505 | Jabir b. Abdullah reported that it was concerning them (the Ansar) that this verse was revealed, that when the two groups amongst you were about to lose heart and Allah was the Guardian of them both. This concerned Banu Salama and Banu Haritha and we did not like that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, should not have revealed this verse for the fact that Allah (gave an assurance) of being the Guardian of both.
2506.01 | Zaid b. Arqam reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:O Allah,, grant forgiveness to the Ansar, the offspring of the Ansar and the offspring of the offspring of the Ansar. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shulba with the same chain of transmitters.
2507 | Anas reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sought forgiveness for the Ansar and he said:I think (he also sought forgiveness) for the children of the Ansar and the slaves and the freed men of the Ansar. I have no doubt about it.
2508 | Anas reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw children and women of the Ansar coming back from a wedding feast. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) stood up motionless (as a mark of respect) and said:O Allah, (bear witness) (and addressing the Ansar), said: You are dearest to me amongst people, (and said: O Allah (bear witness) (and addressing the Ansar), said: You are dearest to me amongst people. And he meant Ansar.
2509.01 | Anas b. Malik reported that a woman from the Ansar came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood aside with her and said:By Him in Whose Hand is my life, you are dearest to me amongst the people. He repeated it thrice.

2510 | Anas b. Malik reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The Ansar are my family and my trusted friends. and the people would increase in number whereas they (the Ansar) would become less and less, so appreciate the deeds of those from amongst them who do good and overlook their failings.
2511.01 | Abu Usaid reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The worthiest clans of the Ansar are Banu Najjar, thereafter Banu al-Ashhal; thereafter Banu Harith b. Banu Khazraj; thereafter Banu Sa'idah and there is goodness in all clans of the Ansar. Sa'd said: I see that he (the Holy Prophet) has placed others above us. It was said to (him): He has placed you above many others.

2511.04 | Ibrahim b. Muhammad b. Talha reported:I heard Abu Sa'ld delivering an address in the presence of Abu 'Utba that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The worthiest settlements of the Ansar are those of Banu Najjar, then of Banu 'Abu al-Ashhal and then of Banu Harith and then of Banu Khazraj and then of the clan of Banu Sa'idah, and if I were to give preference to anyone besides them I would have given preference to my relatives.
2511.05 | Abu Usaid Ansar reported:I bear witness to the fact that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The best settlements of the Ansar are of those of Banu Najjar, then of Banu 'Abu al-Aslihal and then of Banu Harith b. Khazraj, then of Banu Sa'ida and there is in every settlement of the Ansar good. Abu Salama reported that Abu Usaid said: Can I tell a Iie about Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? And if I were a liar, I would have started with my tribe Banu Sa'ida. This was conveyed to Sa'd b. 'Ubida and he found (rankling) in his mind and said: We have been left behind (in the sense) that we have been (mentioned) last of the four. He (Sa'd) sid: Saddle my pony so that I should go to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). His nephew saw him and said: Are you going to contradict (the order of) precedence set by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whereas Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has the best knowledge of it? Is it not sufficient for you that you are the fourth amongst the four (best tribes of the Ansar)? So he returned and said: Allah and His Messenger know best, and he commanded that his pony should be unsaddled.
2511.06 | Abu Usaid Ansari reported that he heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The worthiest of the Ansar or the worthiest of the settlements and the clans of Ansar; the rest of the hadith is the same, but there is no mention of the story of Sa'd b. 'Ubida (Allah be pleased with him).
2512 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying in a large gathering of the Muslims:Should I not tell you of the best clans of the Ansar? They said: Allah's Messenger, (kindly) do this. Thereupon Allah's Messenger said: That is Banu Abd al-Ashhal. They said: Allah's Messenger, then next? He said: Banu Najjar. They again said: Allah's Messenger, then next? He said: Then of Banu Harith b. Khazraj. They then said: Allah's Messenger, then next? He said. Then of Banu Sa'ida. They said: Allah's Messenger, then next? He said: There is good in all the clans of the Ansar. It was upon this that Sa'd b. Ubida stood up in annoyance and said: Are we the last of the four as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has determined (the order of precedence) of their clans? He decided to talk with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on this issue, but the people Of his tribe said to him: Be seated, are you not happy with this that Allah's Messenger' (ﷺ) has mentioned your clan as one of the four (best) clans and those whom he left and did not mention (the order of their precedence) are more than those whom he mentioned? And Sa'd b. 'Ubada dropped the idea of talking to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (on this issue).
2513 | Anas b. Malik reported:I set out along with Jabrir b. 'Abdullah al-Bajali on a journey and he used to serve me. I said to him: Don't do that. Thereupon he said: I have seen Ansar doing this with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I swore by Allah whenever I accompany any one of the Ansar, I would serve him and Ibn Muthanni, and Ibn Bashshir made this addition in their narrations: Jarir was older than Anas, and Ibn Bashshir said: He was of a more advanced age as compared with Anas.

He (Hadrat) 'Umar (again) said: Did you suffer from leprosy and then you were cured from it but for the space of a dirham? He said: Yes. He ('Umar) said: Is your mother (living)? He said: Yes. He ('Umar) said: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say: There would come to you Uwais b. Amir with the reinforcement from the people of Yemen. (He would be) from Qaran, (the branch) of Murid. He had been suffering from leprosy from which he was cured but for a spot of a dirham. His treatment with his mother would have been excellent. If he were to take an oath in the name of Allah, He would honour that. And if it is possible for you, then do ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from your Lord). So he (Uwais) begged forgiveness for him. Umar said: Where do you intend to go? He said: To Kufa. He ('Umar) said: Let me write a letter for you to its governor, whereupon he (Uwais) said: I love to live amongst the poor people. When it was the next year, a person from among the elite (of Kufa) performed Hajj and he met Umar. He asked him about Uwais. He said: I left him in a state with meagre means of sustenance. (Thereupon) Umar said: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: There would come to you Uwais b. 'Amir, of Qaran, a branch (of the tribe) of Murid, along with the reinforcement of the people of Yemen. He had been suffering from leprosy which would have been cured but for the space of a dirham. His treatment with his mother would have been very kind. If he would take an oath in the name of Allah (for something) He would honour it. Ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from Allah) in case it is possible for you. So he came to Uwais and said.: Beg forgiveness (from Allah) for me. He (Uwais) said: You have just come from a sacred journey (Hajj) ; you, therefore, ask forgiveness for me. He (the person who had performed Hajj) said: Ask forgiveness for me (from Allah). He (Uwais again) said: You have just come from the sacred journey, so you ask forgiveness for me. (Uwais further) said: Did you meet Umar? He said: Yes. He (Uwais) then begged forgiveness for him (from Allah). So the people came to know about (the status of religious piety) of Uwais. He went away (from that place).

Hasana, and they had been disputing for the space of a brick. So he left the land.
2543.02 | Abu Dharr reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:You would soon conquer Egypt and that is a land which is known (as the land of al-qirat).

And when you see two persons falling into dispute amongst themselves for the space of a brick, than get out of that. He (Abu Dharr) said: I saw Abd al-Rahman b. Shurahbil b. Hasana and his brother Rabi'a disputing with one another for the space of a brick. So I left that (land).
2544 | Abu Barza reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent a person to a tribe amongst the tribes of Arabia. They reviled him and beat him.

2545 | Abu Naufal reported:I saw (the dead body) of Abdullah b. Zubair hanging on the road of Medina (leading to Mecca). The Quraish passed by it and other people too, that Abdullah b. Umar happened to pass by it. He stood up there and said: May there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib (the Kunya of Hadrat 'Abdullah b. Zubair), may there be peace upon you Abu Khubaib, may there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib! By Allah, I used to forbid you from this; by Allah, I used to forbid you from this, by Allah I used to forbid you from this. By Allah, so far as I know, you had been very much devoted to fasting and prayer and you had been paying very much care to cementing the ties of blood. By Allah, the group to which you belong (are labelled) as (a) wicked (person) is indeed a fine group. Then 'Abdullah b. 'Umar went away. The stand 'Abdullah (b. 'Umar) took in regard to the inhuman treatment (meted out to 'Abdullah b. Zubair) and his words (in that connection) were conveyed to Hajjaj (b. Yusuf) and (as a consequence of that) he (the body of Abdullah b. Zubair) was brought down from the stump (the scaffold) by which it was hanging and thrown into the graves of the Jews. He (Hajjaj) sent (his messenger) to Asma' (bint Abu Bakr, 'Abdullah's mother). But she refused to come. He again sent the messenger to her with the message that she must come, otherwise he would bring her forcibly catching hold of her hair. But she again refused and said: By Allah, I will not come to you until you send one to me who would drag me by pulling my hair. Thereupon he said: Bring me my shoes. He put on his shoes and walked on quickly swollen with vanity and pride until he came to her and said: How do you find what I have done with the enemy of Allah? She said: I find that you wronged him in this world, whereas he has spoiled your next life. It has been conveyed to me that you used to call him ('Abdullah b. Zubair) as the son of one having two belts. By Allah, I am indeed (a woman) of two belts. One is that with the help of which I used to suspend high the food of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and that of Abu Bakr (making it out of the reach) of animals and, so far as the second belt is concerned, that is the belt which no woman can dispense with. Verily Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told us that in Thaqif, there would be born a great liar and great murderer. The liar we have seen, and as far as the murderer is concerned, I do not find anyone else besides you. 'Thereupon he (Hajjaj) stood up and did not give any reply to her.

But Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) made no reply, until he questioned him once, twice or thrice. And there was amongst us Salman the Persian.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Again, it is your mother. He (again) said: Then who? Thereupon he said: Then it is your father. In the hadith transmitted on the authority of Qutalba, there is no mention of the word" the people".
2548.02 | Abu Huraira reported that a person said:Allah's Messenger, who amongst the people is most deserving of my good treatment? He said: Your mother, again your mother, again your mother, then your father, then your nearest relatives according to the order (of nearness).

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Go back to your parents and accord them benevolent treatment.
2550.01 | Abu Huraira reported that Juraij was one who was devoted to (prayer) in the temple. His mother came to him. Humaid said that Abu Rafi' demonstrated before us like the demonstration made by abu Huraira to whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had demonstrated as his mother called him placing her palms upon the eyebrows and lifting her head for calling him and said:Juraij, it is your mother, so talk to her. She found him at that time absorbed in prayer, so he said (to himself): O Lord, my mother (is calling me) (whereas I am absorbed) in my prayer. He opted for prayer. She (his mother) went back, then came again for the second time and said: O Juraij, it is your mother (calling you), so talk to me. He said: O Allah. there is my mother also and my prayer, and he opted for prayer. She said: O Allah, this Juraij is my son. I pray to talk to him but he refuses to talk to me. O Allah, don't bring death to him unless he has seen the prostitutes, and had she invoked the curse upon him (from the heart of her heart) he would have been involved in some turmoil. There was a shepherd living near by his temple (the temple where Juraij was engaged in prayer). It so happened that a woman of that village came there and that shepherd committed fornication with her and she became pregnant and gave birth to a child. It was said to her: Whose child is this? She said: He is the child of one who is living in this temple. So there came persons with hatchets and spades. They called Juraij. He was absorbed in prayer and he did not talk to them and they were about to demolish that temple that he saw them and then came to them and they said: Ask her (this woman) what she says. He smiled and then touched the head of the child and said: Who is your father? He (the child) said: My father is the shepherd of the sheep, and when they heard this, they said: We are prepared to rebuild with gold and silver what we have demolished from your temple. He said: No, rebuild it with clay as it had been before. He then went up (to his room and absorbed himself in prayer).
2550.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Christ son of Mary, the second one the companion of Juraij. Juraij had got constructed a temple and confined himself in that. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. He said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer. He continued with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was busy in prayer, and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in prayer, and he continued with the prayer and she went back, and then on the next day she again came and he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in my prayer, and he continued with the prayer, and she said: My Lord, don't give him death unless he has seen the fate of the prostitutes. The story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer gained currency amongst Bani Isra'il. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty incarnate. She said (to the people): If you like I can allure him to evil. She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him and he had a sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant arid when she gave birth to a child she said: This is from Juraij. So they came and asked him to get down and demolished the temple and began to beat him. He said: What is the matter? They said: You have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a child from your loins. He said: Where is the child? They brought him (the child) and he said: just leave me so that I should observe prayer. And he observed prayer and when he finished, he came to the child. He struck his stomach and said: O boy, who is your father? lie said: He is such shepherd. So they turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking blessing) and said: We are prepared to construct your temple with gold. He said. No, just rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that. Then there was a babe who was sucking his mother that a person dressed in fine garment came riding upon a beast. His mother said: O Allah, make my child like this one. He (the babe) left sucking and began to see towards him, and said: O Allah, don't make me like him. He then returned to the chest and began to suck the milk of his mother. He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am seeing Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as he is explaining the scene of his sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that.

She said: O with shaven head, a good-looking person happened to pass by and I said: O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don't make me like him, and they passed by a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and you committed theft, and I said: O Allah, don't make my child like her, and you said: O Allah, make me like her. Thereupon he said: That person was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah, don't make me like him, and they were saying about her: You committed fornication whereas in fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft whereas she had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her.

They (the ties of blood) said: Certainly so. Thereupon He said: Well, that is how things are for you. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said: Recite if you like:" But if you turn away you are sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship.

O son of Adam, I asked food from you but you did not feed Me. He would say: My Lord, how could I feed Thee whereas Thou art the Lord of the worlds? He said: Didn't you know that such and such servant of Mine asked food from you but you did not feed him, and were you not aware that if you had fed him you would have found him by My side?

O My servants, all of you are naked except for those I have clothed, so seek clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you sin by night and by day, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that would not increase My dominion in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not decrease My dominion in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more that a needle decreases the sea if put into it.

Then it becomes a lump of flesh and forty days later Allah sends His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune. By Him, besides Whom there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people deserving Paradise until between him and Paradise there remains but the distance of a cubit, when suddenly the writing of destiny overcomes him and he begins to act like the denizens of Hell and thus enters Hell, and another one acts in the way of the denizens of Hell, until there remains between him and Hell a distance of a cubit that the writing of destiny overcomes him and then he begins to act like the people of Paradise and enters Paradise.

Then he creates his sense of hearing, sense of sight, his skin, his flesh, his bones, and then says: My Lord, would he be male or female? And your Lord decides as He desires and the angel then puts down that also and then says: My Lord, what about his age? And your Lord decides as He likes it and the angel puts it down.

2647.01 | Ali reported:We were in a funeral in the graveyard of Gharqad when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to us and we sat around him. He had a stick with him. He lowered his head and began to scratch the earth with his stick, and then said: There is not one amongst you whom a seat in Paradise or Hell has not been allotted and about whom it has not been written down whether he would be an evil person or a blessed person. A person said: Allah's Messenger, should we not then depend upon our destiny and abandon our deeds? Thereupon he said: Acts of everyone will be facilitated in that which has been created for him so that whoever belongs to the company of the blessed will have good works made easier for him and whoever belongs to the unfortunate ones will have evil acts made easier for him. He then recited this verse (from the Qur'an): "Then, who gives to the needy and guards against evil and accepts the excellent (the truth of Islam and the path of righteousness it prescribes), We shall make easy for him the easy end and who is miserly and considers himself above need, We shall make easy for him the difficult end" (xcii. 5-10).

2648.01 | Jabir reported that Suriqa b. Malik b. Ju'shuin came and said:Allah's Messenger, explain our religion to us (in a way) as if we have been created just now. Whosoever deeds we do today, is it because of the fact that-the pens have dried (after recording them) and the destitiles have began to operate or these have effects in future? Thereupon he said: The pens have dried tmd destinies have begun to operate. (Suraqa b. Malik) said: If it Is so, then what is the use of doing good deeds? Zuhair said: Then Abu Zubair said something but I could not understand that and I said. What did he say? Thereupon he said: Act, for everyone is facilitated what he intends to do.

2650 | Abu al-Aswad reported that 'Imran b Husain asked him:What is your view, what the people do today in the world, and strive for, is it something decreed for them or preordained for them or will their fate in the Hereafter be deterrained by the fact that their Prophets brought them teaching which they did not act upon? I said: Of course, it is something which is predetermined for them and preordained for them. He (further) said: Then, would it not be an injustice (to punish them)? I felt greatly disturbed because of that, and said: Everything is created by Allah and lies in His Power. He would not be questioned as to what He does, but they would be questioned; thereupon he said to me: May Allah have mercy upon you, I did not mean to ask you but for testing your intelligence. Two men of the tribe of Muzaina came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, what is your opinion that the people do in the world and strive for, is something decreed for them; something preordained for them and will their fate in the Hereafter be determined by the fact that their Prophets brought them teachings which they did not act upon. and thus they became deserving of punishment? Thereupon, he said: Of course, it happens as it is decreed by Destiny and preordained for them, and this view is confirmed by this verse of the Book of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious:" Consider the soul and Him Who made it perfect, then breathed into it its sin and its piety" (xci. 8).
2651 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Verily, a man would perform the deeds of the people of Paradise for a long time, then his deeds would be concluded with the deeds of the people of Hell.

2652.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying:There was argument between Adam and Moses. Moses said to Adam: You are our father. You did us harm and caused us to get out of Paradise. Adam said to him: You are Moses. Allah selected you (for direct conversation with you) and wrote with His own Hand the Book (Torah) for you. Despite this you blame me for an act which Allah had ordained for me forty years before He created me. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said:. This is how Adam came the better of Moses and Adam came the better of Moses.
2652.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:There was argument between Adam and Moses, and Adam came the better of Moses. Moses said to him: You are the same Adam who misled people, and caused them to get out of Paradise.

Adam then again said: Even then you blame me for an affair which had been ordained for me before I was created.

Then you caused the people to get down to the earth because of your lapse. Adam said: Are you that Moses whom Allah selected for His Messengership and for His conversation with him and conferred upon you the tablets, in which everything was clearly explained and granted you the audience in order to have confidential talk with you. What is your opinion, how long Torah would haye been written before I was created? Moses said: Forty years before. Adam said: Did you not see these words: Adam committed an error and he was enticed to (do so). He (Moses) said: Yes. Whereupon, he (Adam) said: Do you then blame me for an act which Allah had ordained for me forty years before He created me? Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: This is how Adam came the better of Moses.
2652.04 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:There was an argument between Adam and Moses. Moses said: Are you that Adam whose lapse caused you to get out of Paradise? Adam said to him: Are you that Moses whom Allah selected for His Messengership, for His conversation and you blame me for an affair which had been ordained for me before I was created? This is how Adam came the better of Moses.

Surely, We have created everything according to a measure" (liv. 48).
2657.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:Verily Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit. The adultery of the eye is the lustful look, and the adultery of the tongue is the licentious speech, the heart desires and yearns, which the parts may or may not put into effect.
2658.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying. Allah fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in. There would be no escape from it.

He said: It is Allah alone Who knows what they would be doing.
2658.06 | It is reported on the authority of Abu Mu'awiya that (the Holy Prophet) said:Every new-born babe is born on the millat (of Islam and he) remains on this until his tongue is enabled to express himself.

2659.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The mother of every person gives him birth according to his true nature.

2663.02 | Abdullah reported that Umm Habiba, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), said:0 Allah, enable me to derive benefit from my husband, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and from my father Abu Sufyan and from my brother Mu'awiya. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: You have asked from Allah about durations of life already set, and the length of days already allotted and the sustenances the share of which has been fixed. Allah would not do anything earlier before its due time, or He would not delay anything beyond its due time. And if you were to ask Allah to provide you refuge from the torment of the HellFire, or from the torment of the grave, it would have good in store for you and better for you also. He (the narrator) further said: Mention was made before him about monkeys, and Mis'ar (one of the narrators) said: I think that (the narrator) also (made a mention) of the swine, which had suffered metamorphosis.

Nothing would take place earlier than its due time, and nothing would be deferred beyond that when it is due. So, if you were to ask Allah about your safety from the torment of Hell-Fire and from the torment of the grave, it would have been better for you. A person said: Allah's Messenger, what about those apes and swine which suffered metamorphosis? Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, did not destroy a people or did not torment a people, and let their race grow. Apes and swine had been even before that (when the deniers of truth were tormented and suffered metamorphosis). This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sufyin through another chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.
2664 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:A strong believer is better and is more lovable to Allah than a weak believer, and there is good in everyone, (but) cherish that which gives you benefit (in the Hereafter) and seek help from Allah and do not lose heart, and if anything (in the form of trouble) comes to you, don't say: If I had not done that, it would not have happened so and so, but say: Allah did that what He had ordained to do and your" if" opens the (gate) for the Satan.
2665 | 'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited (these verses of the Qur'an):"He it is Who revealed to thee (Muhammad) the Book (the Qur'an) wherein there are clear revelations-these are the substance of the Book and others are allegorical (verses). And as for those who have a yearning for error they go after the allegorical verses seeking (to cause) dissension, by seeking to explain them. And none knows their implications but Allah, and those who are sound in knowledge say: We affirm our faith in everything which is from our Lord. It is only the persons of understanding who really heed" (Al-Qur'an 3:7).

They would say: They beg of Thee forgiveness. He would say: I grant pardon to them, and confer upon them what they ask for and grant them protection against which they seek protection. They (the angels) would again say: Our Lord, there is one amongst them such and such simple servant who happened to pass by (that assembly) and sat there along with them (who had been participating in that assembly). He (the Lord) would say: I also grant him pardon, for they are a people the seat-fellows of whom are in no way unfortunate.

I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her; she refused but on the condition of getting one hundred dinirs. It was with very great difficulty that I could collect one hundred dinirs and then paid them to her and when I was going to have a sexual intercourse with her, that she said: Servant of Allah, fear Allah and do not break the seal (of chastity) but by lawful means. I got up. 0 Allah, if Thou art aware that I did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, rid us from this trouble. The situation was somewhat eased for them. The third one said: Allah, I employed a workman for a measure of rice. After he had finished his work I gave him his dues (in the form of) a measure of rice, but he did not accept them. I used these rice as seeds, and that gave a bumper crop and I became rich enough to have cows and flocks (in my possession). He came to me and said: Fear Allah, and commit no crueltv upon me in regard to my dues. I said to him: Takeaway this flock of cows and sheep. He said: Fear Allah and do not make a fun of me. I said: I am not making a fun of you. You take the cows and the flocks. So he took them. 0 Allah, if Thou art aware that I did it for Thine pleasure, case the situation for us. And Allah relieved them from the rest of the trouble.

By Allah, Allah is more delighted at the repentance of His servant than that person (as he finds his lost) camel.
2747.01 | Anas b.

Thereupon he said: I say that when we are in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) we ponder over Hell-Fire and Paradise as if we are seeing them with our very eyes and when we are away from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) we attend to our wives, our children, our business; most of these things (pertaining to After-life) slip out of our minds.

I said: Allah's Messenger, when we are in your company, we are reminded of Hell-Fire and Paradise as if we are seeing them with our own eyes, but whenever we go away from you and attend to our wives, children and business, much of these things go out of our minds. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if your state of mind remains the same as it is in my presence and you are always busy in remembrance (of Allah), the Angels will shake hands with you in your beds and in your paths but, Hanzala, time should be devoted (to the worldly affairs) and time (should be devoted to prayer and meditation). He (the Holy Prophet) said this thrice.

2766.01 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:There was a person before you who had killed ninety-nine persons and then made an inquiry about the learned persons of the world (who could show him the way to salvation). He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine persons and asked him whether there was any scope for his repentance to be accepted. He said: No. He killed him also and thus completed one hundred. He then asked about the learned persons of the earth and he was directed to a scholar, and he told him that he had killed one hundred persons and asked him whether there was any scope for his repentance to be accepted. He said: Yes; what stands between you and the repentance? You better go to such and such land; there are people devoted to prayer and worship and you also worship along with them and do not come to the land of yours since it was an evil land (for you). So he went away and he had hardly covered half the distance when death came to him and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment. The angels of mercy said: This man has come as a penitant and remorseful to Allah and the angels of punishment said: He has done no good at all. Then there came another angel in the form of a human being in order to decide between them. He said: You measure the land to which he has drawn near. They measured it and found him nearer to the land where he intended to go (the land of piety), and so the angels of mercy took possession of it. Qatada said that Hasan told him that it was said to them that as death approached him, he crawled upon his chest (and managed) to slip in the land of mercy.
2766.02 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying that a man killed ninety-nine persons and then he began to make an inquiry whether there was any way left for him for repentance.

He killed the monk also and then began to make an inquiry and moved from one village to another village where there lived pious persons, and as he had covered some distance, he was overtaken by death, but he managed to crawl upon his chest (to the side nearer to the place where the pious men lived). He died and then there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment and (when it was measured) he was found to be nearer to the village where pious persons were living equal to the Space of a span and he was thus included among them.
2766.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Qatida with the same chain of transmitters but (with this variation of wording):" Allah commanded the earth (from where) he wanted to come out to move itself away and to the other earth (where he wanted to go) to draw nearer."
2767.01 | Abu Musa' reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:When it will be the Day of Resurrection Allah would deliver to every Muslim a Jew or a Christian and say: That is your rescue from Hell-Fire.

'Abd al-'Aziz, whereupon he said: Was it your father who narrated it to you from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ)? I said: Yes.

He would say: My Lord, I do recognise (them). He (the Lord) would say: I concealed them for you in the world. And today I forgive them. And he would then be given the Book containing (the account of his) good deeds. And so far as the non-believers and hypocrites are concerned, there would be general announcement about them before all creation telling them that these (people, i. e. non-believers and hypocrites) told a lie about Allah.

Malik narrate the story of his remaining behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from the Battle of Tabuk. Ka'b b. Malik said:I never remained behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from any expedition which he undertook except the Battle of Tabuk and that of the Battle of Badr. So far as the Battle of Badr is concerned, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the Muslims (did not set out for attack but for waylaying) the caravan of the Quraish, but it was Allah Who made them confront their enemies without their intention (to do so). I had the honour to be with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the night of 'Aqaba when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was more dear to me than my participation in the Battle of Badr, although Badr was more popular amongst people as compared with that (Tabuk). And this is my story of remaining back from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the occasion of the Battle of Tabuk. Never did I possess means enough and (my circumstances) more favourable than at the occasion of this expedition. And, by Allah, I had never before this expedition simultaneously in my possession two rides. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set out for this expedition in extremely hot season; the journey was long and the land (which he and his army had to cover) was waterless and he had to confront a large army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual situation (they had to face), so that they should adequately equip themselves for this expedition, and he also told them the destination where he intended to go. And the Muslims who accompanied Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at that time were large in numbers but there was no proper record of them. Ka'b (further) said: Few were the persons who wanted to absent themselves, and were under the impression that they could easily conceal themselves (and thus remain undetected) until revelations from Allah, the Exalted and Glorious (descended in connection with them). And Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set out on an expedition when the fruits were ripe and their shadows had been lengthened. I had weakness for them and it was during this season that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made preparations and the Muslims too along with them. I also set out in the morning so that I should make preparations along with them but I came back and did nothing and said to myself: I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) until people were about to depart and it was in the morning that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set out and the Muslims too along with him, but I made no preparations. I went early in the morning and came back, but I made no decision. I continued to do so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. I also made up my mind to march on and to meet them. Would that I had done that but perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as I went out amongst people, I was shocked to find that I did not find anyone like me but people who were labelled as hypocrites or the people whom Allah granted exemption because of their incapacity and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took no notice of me until he had reached Tabuk. (One day as he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk) he said: What has happened to Ka'b b. Malik? A person from Banu' Salama said: Allah's Messenger, the (beauty) of his cloak and his appreciation of his sides have allured him and he was thus detained. Mua'dh b. Jabal said: Woe be upon that what you contend. Allah's Messenger, by Allah, we know nothing about him but good. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), however, kept quiet. It was during that time that he (the Holy Prophet) saw a person (dressed in all white (garment) shattering the illusion of eye (mirage). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: May he be Abu Khaithama and, lo, it was Abu Khaithama al-Ansari and he was that person who contributed a sa' of dates and was scoffed at by the hypocrites. Ka'b b. Malik farther said: When this news reached me that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was on his way back from Tabuk I was greatly perturbed. I thought of fabricating false stories and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger on the following day. In this connection, I sought the help of every prudent man from amongst the members of my family and when it was said to me that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was about to arrive, all the false ideas banished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing could save me but the telling of truth, so I decided to speak the truth and it was in the morning that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived (in Medina). And it was his habit that as he came back from a journey he first went to the mosque and observed two Rak'ahs of nafl prayer (as a mark of gratitude) and then sat amongst people. And as he did that, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him and they were more than eighty persons. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their secret (intentions) to Allah, until I presented myself to him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He (the Holy Prophet) then said to me: Come forward. I went forward until I sat in front of him. He said to me: What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride? I said: Allah's Messenger, by Allah, if I were to sit in the presence of anybody else from amongst the worldly people I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext (or the other) and I have also the knack to fall into argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware of the fact that if I were to put forward before you a false excuse to please you Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me, and if I speak the truth you may be annoyed with me, but I hope that Allah would make its end well and, by Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind you (failed to join the expedition). Thereupon, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: This man told the truth, so get up until Allah gives a decision in your case. I stood up and some people of Banu' Salama followed me in hot haste, and they said to me: By Allah, we do not know about you that you committed a sin prior to this. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as those who stayed behind him have put forward excuses. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would have sought forgiveness for you. By Allah, they continued to incite me until I thought of going back to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and contradict myself. Then I said to them: Has anyone else also met the same fate? They said: Yes, two persons have met the same fate as has fallen to you and they have made the sane statement as you have made, and the same verdict has been delivered in their case as it has been delivered in your case. I said: Who are they? They said: Murara b. ar-Rabi'a 'Amiri and Hilal b. Umayya al-Waqafi. They made a mention of these two pious persons to me who had participated in the Battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I went away when they named these two persons. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade the Nluslims to talk with three of us from amongst those (persons) who had stayed behind him. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us underwent a change and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned (hostile) against us and it was in fact the same atmosphere ot which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves withen their houses and spent (most of the) time in weeping, but as I was young and strong amongst them I got (out of my house), participated in congregational prayers, moved about in the bazar; but none spoke to me. I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as he sat amongst (people) after the prayer, greeted him and asked myself whether his lips stirred in response to my greetings (or not). Then I observed prayer beside him and looked at him with stealing glances and when I attended to my prayer, he looked at me and when I cast a glance at him he turned away his eyes from me. And when the harsh treatment of the Muslims towards me extended to a (considerable) length of time, I walked until I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada, and he was my cousin, and I had the greatest love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not respond to my greetings. I said to him: Abu Qatada, I adjure you by Allah, arn't you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ) the most. He kept quiet. I again repeated saying: I adjure you by Allah. arn't you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ) the most. He kept quiet. I again adjured him, whereupon he said: Allah and the Messenger (ﷺ) are best aware of it. My eyes began to shed tears and I came back climbing down from the wall and as I was walking in the bazar of Medina a Nabatean from amongst the Nabateans of Syria, who had come to sell foodgrains in Medina, asked people to direct him to Ka'b b. Malik. People gave him the indication by pointing towards me. He came to me and delivered to me a letter of the King of Ghassan and as I was a scribe I read that letter and it was written like this:" Coming to my point, it has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Holy Prophet) is subjecting you to cruelty and Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place, so you come to us that we should accord you honour. As I read that letter I said: This is also a calamity, so I burnt it in the oven. When out of the fifty days, forty days had passed and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) received no revelation, there came the messenger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to me and said: Verily, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has commanded you to remain separate from your wife. I said: Should I divorce her or what (else) should I do? He said: No, but only remain separate from her and don't have sexual contact with her. The same message was sent to my companions. So I said to my wife: You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case. The wife of Hilal b. Umayya came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, Hilal b. Umayya is a senile person, he has no servant. Do you disapprove of my serving him? He said: No, but don't go near him. She said: By Allah, he has no such instinct in him. By Allah, he spends his time in weeping from that day to this day. Some of the members of my family said to me: Were you to seek permission from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in regard to your wife as he has granted permission to the wife of Hilal b. Umayya to serve him. I said: I would not seek permission from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), for I cannot say what Allah's Apostle may say in response to seeking my permission. Moreover, I am a young man. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty nights had passed that (people) had observed boycott with us. It was on the morning of the fiftieth night that I observed my dawn prayer and was sitting on one of the roofs of our houses. And I was in fact sitting in that very state which Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has described about us in these words:" Life had become hard for myself and the earth had compressed despite its vastness," that I heard the noise of an announcer from the peak of the hill of Sal' saying at the top of his voice: Ka'b b. Malik, there is glad tidings for you. I fell down in prostration and came to realise that there was (a message of) relief for me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had informed the people of the acceptance of our repentance by Allah as he offered the dawn prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my friends in order to give them the glad tidings and a person galloped his horse and came from the tribe of Aslam and his horse reached me more quickly than his voice. And when he came to me whose sound I heard, he gave me the glad tidings. I took off my clothes and clothed him with them because of his bringing good news to me and, by Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) than these two on that occasion, and I asked one to lend me two clothes and dressed myself in them. I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and on my way I met groups of people who greeted me because of (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: Here is a greeting for you for your repentance being accepted by Allah. (I moved on) until I came to the mosque and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been sitting there amongst persons. So Talha b. 'Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me and he shook hands with me and greeted me and, by Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the emigrants except he. Ka'b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talha. Ka'b further said: I greeted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with Assalam-o-'Alaikam and his face was glistening because of delight, and he said: Let there be glad tidings and blessings for you, the like of which (you have neither found nor you will find, as you find today) since your mother gave your birth. I said: Allah's Messenger. is this acceptance of repentance from you or from Allah? He said: No, (it is not from ma), it is from Allah, and it was common with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that as he was happy his face brightened up and it looked like a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognised it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said: Allah's Messenger, am I allowed to give in charity my wealth for Allah's sake and for the sake of His Messenger (ﷺ)? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Keep some property with you as it is better for you. I said: I shall keep with me that part (of my property) which fell to my lot (on the occasion of the expedition of) Khaibar. I said: Allah's Messenger, verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of truth and, therefore, (I think) that repentance implies that I should not speak anything but truth as long as I live. He said: By Allah, I do not know whether anyone amongst the Muslims was put to more severe trial than I by Allah because of telling the truth. And since I made a mention of this to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) up to this day I have not told any lie and, by Allah, I have decided not to tell a lie and I hope that Allah would save me (from trials) for the rest of my life and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed these verses:" Certainly, Allah has turned in Mercy to the Prophet and the emigrants and the helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship after the hearts of a part of them were about to deviate; then He turned to them in mercy. Surely, to them He is Compassionate, Merciful and (He turned in Mercy) to the three who were left behind until the earth despite its vastness became strait for them and their souls were also straitened to them." And this revelation reached up to the (words):" O you who believe, develop God consciousness, and be with the truthful" (ix. 117-118). Ka'b said: By Allah, since Allah directed me to Islam there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who told lies, for in regard to those who told lies Allah used harshest words used for anyone as He descended revelation (and the words of Allah are):" They will swear by Allah to you when you return to them so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. Surely, they are unclean and their resort is Hell, recompense for what they earned. They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them but if you are pleased with them, yet surely Allah is not pleased with the transgressing people" (ix. 95-96). K'ab said that the matter of us three persons was deferred as compared with those who took an oath in the presence of Allahs Messenger (ﷺ) and he accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and Allah did not give any decision in regard to us. It was Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, Who gave decisions in our case, three who remained behind. (The words of the Qur'an)" the three who were left behind" do not mean that we remained back from Jihad but these imply that He kept our matter behind them who took oath and presented excuse before Him. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.
2769.03 | 'Abdullah b. K'ab, who was his (Ka'b's) guide as he became blind, reported that he heard from Ka'b b. Malik the story of his staying behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from the expedition of Tabuk. The rest of the hadith is the same (but with this variation) that in the narration transmitted on the authority of Yunus (the words are):When Allah's Messenger (may. peace be upon him) intended to set on an expedition he kept It as a secret, but. be did not do so in thic. expedition. And in the narration transmitted on the authority of Muhammad b. Abdullah b. Muslim, there is no mention of Abu Khaithana (Allah be pleased with him) and no mention of his meeting with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
2769.04 | It is reported on the authority of Abdullah b. K'ab and he was the guide of Ka'b as he lost his eyesight and he was the greatest scholar amongst his people and he retained in his mind many ahadith of the Companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He said:I heard my father Ka'b b. Malik, and he fas one of those three whose repentance was accepted (by Allah). He transmitted that He never lagged behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from any expedition that he undertook except two expeditions; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the tradition narrated through another chain of transmitters the words are:" That Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set out on an expedition with a large number of persons more than ten thousand and this could not be recorded in the census register."
2770.01 | Sa'id b. Musayyib, 'Urwa b. Zubair, 'Alqama b. Waqqas and 'Ubaidullah b. Abdullah b. 'Utba b. Mas'ud--all of them reported the story of the false allegation against 'A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). And they (the slanderers) said what they had to say, but Allah exonerated her of this charge and all of them reported a part of the hadith and some of them who had better memories reported more and with better retention, and I tried to retain this hadith (listening) from every one of them that they reported to me and some of them attested the other. (The sumaried substance of the false allegation is this):'A'isha said: Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) intended to set out on a journey he cast lots amongst his wives and he took one with him in whose favour the lot was cast. It so happened that he cast lots amongst us while setting out on a battle and it was cast in my favour, so I set out along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). This relates to the period when the revelation concerning the commands of veil had been made. I was carried in a haudaj and I was brought down where we had to stay. In short, when we set out for return journey from the expedition and our caravan was near Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded one night to march forward. I also got up when the command for the march was given and moved on until I went out of the encampments of the army and after relieving myself I came to my place. I touched my chest and found that my necklace which had been made of the stones of zafar had been broken. I retraced my steps and tried to search my necklace and this detained me there. The group of people who saddled my ride and placed my haudaj carrying me upon the camels marched on. They were under the impression that I was in it. The women in those days were light of weight and they did not wear much flesh, as they ate less food; so they did not perceive the weight of my haudaj as they placed it upon the camel as I was a young girl at that time. So they drove the camel and Eet out and I found my necklace after the army had marched. I came to my place and there was none to call and none to respond (the call). I waited at my place under the impression that when the people would riot find me they would come back. So I kept sitting at my place. I was overpowered by sleep and slept. Safwan b. Mu'attal Sulami Dhakwini, who had lagged behind the army because of taking rest came to my place walking in the latter part of the night and he saw the body of a person who was asleep. He came to me and recognised me as he had seen rue before it was enjoined to observe purda. I got ap by his voice as he recited Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un [we are for Allah and to Him we have to return. ] and I covered my head with my headdress. By Allah, he did not speak to me a word and I did not hear a word from him except Inna lillahi. He made his camel kneel down and I amounted the camel as he pressed tLe camel's foreleg and he moved on leaning the camel by the nose string on which I was riding until we came to the army where it had encamped for rest because of extreme heat. Woe be upon those who harboured doubts about me and the most notorious among them was 'Abdullah b. Ubayy, the great hypocrite. We came to Medina and I fell sick for a month. The people had been deliberating over the statements of those who had brought these calumnies against me. I was absolutely unaware of anything concerning that. This, however, caused doubt in my mind that I did not see Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him.) treating me with such kindness with which he treated me as I fell ill before this. The Prophet (ﷺ) would coome and greet me with Assalam-o-'Alaikum and only ask me how I was. This caused doubt in my mind, but I was unaware of the evil. I wept outside despite my failing health and there went along with me Umm Mistah and she said the daughter of Abu Rhm b. Muttalib b. 'Abd Manaf and his mother was the daughter of Sakhr b. 'Amir, the sister of the mother of Abu Bakr Sidiq and his son was Mistah b. Uthatha b. 'Abbad b. Muttalib. I and the daughter of Abu Rahm set towards the direction of my house. Something got into the head dress of Umm Mistah and she said: Woe be upon Mistah. And I said. Woe be upon what you say. Do you curse people who had participated in Badr? She said: Innocent woman, have you not heard what he said? I said: What did he say? She conveyed to me the statement of those who had brought false allegations against me. So my illness was aggravated. I went to my house and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me and he greeted me and then said: How is that woman? I said: Do you permit me to go to the (house) of my parents? She (further) said: I had at that time made up my mind to confirm this news from them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) permitted me. So I came to (the house of) my parents and said to my mother: Mother, do you know what the people are talking about? She said: My daughter, you should not worry. By Allah, if there is a handsome woman who is loved by her husband and he has co-wives also they talk many a thing about her. I said: Hallowed be Allah, what are the people talking about? I wept during the whole night until it was morning and I did not have a wink of sleep and I wept even in the morning. As the revelation was delayed (in regard to this matter), so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called 'Ali ibn Abi 'Talib and Usama b. Zaid in order to seek their advice in regard to the separation of his wife. Usama b. Zaid told Allah's Messenger (may peace be apen him) about the innocence of his wives and what he knew about his love for them. He said: Allah's Messenger, they are your wives and we know nothing else about them but goodness. And as for 'Ali b. Abu Talib, he said: Allah has not put any unnecessary burden upon you (in regard to your wives). There are a number of women besides her and if you ask that maidservant (Barira) she will tell you the truth. So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called Bailra and said: Barira, did you see anything in 'A'isha which can cause doubt about her? Barira said: By Him Who sent thee with the truth, I have seen nothing objectionable in her but only this much that she is a young girl and she goes to sleep while kneading the flour and the lamb eats that. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) mounted the pulpit and sought vindication against 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul, and he further said: Who would exonerate me from imputations of that person who has troubled (me) in regard to my family? By Allah, I find nothing in my wife but goodness and the person whom the people have mentioned in this connection is, according to my knowledge, a thoroughly pious person, and he did never get into my house but along with me. Sa'd b. Mu'adh stood up and said: Allah's Messenger, I defend your honour against him. If he belong to the tribe of Aus we would strike his neck and if he belongs to the tribe of our brother Khazraj and you order us we would comply with your order. Then Sa'd b. 'Ubada stood up. He was chief of the Khazraj tribe. He was otherwise a pioas man but he had some what tribal partisanship in him and he said to Sa'd b. Mu'adh: By the everlasting existence of Allah. you are not stating the fact, you will not be able to kill him and you will not have the power to do so. Thereupon, Usaid b. Hudair stood up, and he was the first cousin of Sa'd b. Mu'adh and said to Sa'd b. 'Ubada: By the everlasting existence of Allah, you are not stating the fact. We would kill him. You are a hypocrite and so you argue in defence of the hypocrites, and thus both the tribes Aus and Khazraj were flared up, until they were about to fall upon one another and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept standing upon the pulpit and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) tried to subside their anger until they became silent and thus there was silence. 'A'isha further reported: I spent the whole day in weeping and even the night and could not have a wink of sleep even next night. My parents thought that this constant weeping of mine would break my heart. I wept and they sat beside me. In the meanwhile a woman of the Ansar came to see me. I permitted her to see me and she also began to weep. And we were in this very state that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and he greeted me and then sat down. He had never sat with me since a month when this rumour was afloat, and there was no revelation (to clarity) my case. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited Tashahhud (there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said: Coming to the point, 'A'isha, this is what has reached me about you and if you are innocent, Allah would Himself vindicate your honour, and if accidentally there has been a lapse on your part seek forgiveness of Allah; He will pardon thee for when a servant makes a confession of his fault and turns (to Him) penitently, Allah also turns to him (mercifully) accepting his repentance. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) talked, my tears dried up and not even a single drop of tear was perceived by me (rolling out of my eyes). I said to my father: You give a reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf. He said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I then said to my mother: Give a reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf, but she said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I was a small girl at that time and I had not read much of the Qur'an (but I said): By Allah, I perceive that you have heard about this and it has settled down in your mind and you have taken it to be true, so if I say to you that I am quite innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would never believe me to be true, and if I confess to (the alleged) lapse before you, whereas Allah knows that I am completely innocent (and I have not committed this sin at all), in that case You will take me to be true and, by Allah, I, therefore, find no other alternative for me and for you except that what the father of Yousuf said:, (My course is) comely patience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought for in that (predicament) which ye describe" (xii 18). After this I turned my face to the other side and lay down on my bed. By Allah, I was fully aware of this fact that I was innocent but I did not expect that Allah would descend Wahy Matlu (Qur'anic Wahy) in my case as I did not think myself so much important that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would speak in this matter in words to be recited. I only hoped that Allah would in vision give an indication of my innocence to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) during his sleep. And, by Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not moved an inch from where he had been sitting and none from the members of my family had gone that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, descended revelation upon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) there and then and he felt the burden which he used to feel at the time of receiving revelation. He began to perspire because of the burden of words of Allah as they descended upon him even during the winter season and there fell the drops of his sweat like silvery beads. When this state of receiving revelation was over, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled and the first words which he spoke to me were that he said: 'A'isha, there is glad tidings for you. Verily, Allah has vindicated your honour, and my mother who had been standing by me said: Get up (and thank him, i. e. the Holy Prophet). I said: By Allah, I shall not thank him and laud him but Allah Who has descended revelation vindicating my honour. She ('A'isha) said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed:" 'Verily, those who spread the slander are a gang among you" (and) ten (subsequent) verses in regard to my innocence. She further said: Abu Bakr used to give to Mistah (some stipend) as a token of kinship with him and for his poverty and he (Abu Bakr) said: By Allah, now I would not spend anything for him. 'A'isha said: It was upon this that Allah the Exalted and Glorious revealed this verse:" And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear to give to the near of the kin" up to" Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you?" Hibban b. Musa' said that 'Abdullah b. Mubarak used to say: It is a verse contained in the Book which most (eminently) brightens the hope. Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I wish that Allah should pardon me. I shall never stop this stipend. So he continued to give him the stipend which he had withdrawn. 'A'isha said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked Zainab, daughter of Jahsh, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), about me what she knew or what she had seen in me, and she said: Allah's Messenger, I shall not say anything without hearing (with my ears) and seeing with my eyes. By Allah, I find nothing in her but goodness. (And she stated this in spite of the fact) that she was the only lady who amongst the wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) used to vie with me but Allah saved her in bringing false allegation against me because of her God-consciousness. Her sister Hamna bint Jahsh, however, opposed her and she was undone along with others.
2770.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri through other chains of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording. In the hadith transmitters on the authority of 'Urwa, there is an addition of these words:" 'A'isha did not like that Hassan should be rebuked in her presence and she used to say: It was he who wrote this verse also:" 'Verily, my father and my mother and my honour, those are all meant for defending the honour of Muhammad against you." And 'Urwa further reported that 'A'isha said: By Allah, the person, about whom the allegation was trade used to say: Hallowed be Allah, by One, in Whose hand is my life, I have never unveiled any woman, and then he die, & as a martyr in the cause of Allah, and in the narration transmitted on the authority of Ya'qub b. Ibrahim., the word is Mu'irin and in the narration transmitted on the'authority of 'Abd al-Razzaq it is Mughirin. 'Abd b. Humaid said: I said to 'Abd al-Razzaq: What does this word Mughirin mean? And he said: Al- waghra means intense heat.
2770.03 | 'A'Isha reported:When I came under discussion what the people had to say about me, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up for delivering an address and he recited tashahhud (I bear witness to the fact that iheie is no god but Allah) and praised Allah, lauded Him what He rightly deserves and then said: Coming to the point. Give me an advice about them who have brought false charge about my family. By Allah, I know no evil in the members of my family and the person in connection with whom the false charge is being levelled, I know no evil in him too. And he never entered my house but in my presence and when I was away on a journey, he remained with me even in that. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this change that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to my house and asked my maidservant and she said: By Allah, I know no fault in her but this that she sleeps, and goat comes and eats the kneaded flour. Some of the Companions (of the Holy Prophet) scolded her and said: State the fact before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and they even made a pointed reference (to this incident). She said: gallowed be Allah. By Allah, I know about her as does the jeweller know about the pure piece of gold. And when this news reached the person in connection with whom the allegation was made he said: Hallowed be Allah. By Allah, I have never unveiled any woman. 'A'isha said: He fell as a martyr in the cause of Allah, and there is this addition in this hadith that the people who had brought false allegation amongst them were Mistah and Hamna and Hassan. And so far as the hypocrite 'Abdullah b. Ubayy is concerned, he was one who tried his best to gather the false news and then gave them the wind. And he was in fact a fabricator and there was Hamna, daughter of Jahsh with him.
2771 | Anas reported that a person was charged with fornication with the slavegirl of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to 'Ali:Go and strike his neck. 'Ali came to him and he found him in a well making his body cool. 'Ali said to him: Come out, and as he took hold of his hand and brought him out, he found that his sexual organ had been cut. Hadrat 'Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.
2772 | Zaid b. Arqam reported:We set out on a journey along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in which we faced many hardships. 'Abdullah b. Ubayy said to his friends: Do not give what you have in your possession to those who are with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) until they desert him. Zubair said: That is the reciting of that person who recited as min haulahu (from around him) and the other reciting is man haulahia (who are around him). And in this case when we would return to Medina the honourable would drive out the meaner therefrom (lxiv. 8). I came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and informed him about that and he sent someone to 'Abdullah b. Ubayy and he asked him whether he had said that or not. He took an oath to the fact that he had not done that and told that it was Zaid who had stated a lie to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Zaid said: I was much perturbed because of this until this verse was revealed attesting my truth:" When the hypocrites come" (lxiii. 1). Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) then called them in order to seek forgiveness for them, but they turned away their heads as if they were hooks of wood fixed in the wall (lxiii. 4), and they were in fact apparently good-looking persons.
2773.01 | Jabir reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came to the grave of 'Abdullah b. Ubayy, brought him out from that, placed him on his knee and put his saliva in his mouth and shrouded him in his own shirt and Allah knows best.
2773.02 | Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to the grave of 'Abdullah b. Ubayy as he was placed in that. The rest of the hadith is the same.
2774.01 | Ibn 'Umar reported that when 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul died. His son 'Abdullah b. 'Abdullah (b. Ubayy) came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and begged him that he should give him his shirt which he would use as a coffin for his father, he gave him that. He then begged that he should conduct funeral prayer for him. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had hardly got up to observe the prayer for him that 'Umar stood up and caught hold of the garment of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:Allah's Messenger, are you going to conduct prayer for this man, whereas Allah has forbidden you to offer prayer for him? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Allah has given me an option as He has said:" You may beg pardon for them or you may not beg pardon for them, and even if you beg pardon for them, seventy times" (ix. 80), and I am going to make an addition to the seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered prayer for him and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" Do not offer prayer for any one of them at all and do not stand upon their graves for (offering prayer over them)" (ix. 84).
2774.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah with the same chain of transmitters but with this addition:" He then abandoned offering (funeral) prayer for them."
2775.01 | Ibn Mas'ud reported that there gathered near the House three persons amongst whom two were Quraishi and one was a Thaqafi or two were Thaqafis and one was a Quraishi. They lacked understanding but wore more flesh. One of them said:Do you think that Allah hears as we speak? The other one said: He does hear when we speak loudly and He does not hear when we speak in undertones, and still the other one said: If He listens when we speak loudly, He also listens when we speak in undertones. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:" You did not conceal yourselves lest your ears, your eyes and your skins would stand witness against you" (xli. 22).
2775.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah through another chain of transmitters.
2776.01 | Zaid b. Thabit reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) set out for Uhud. Some of those persons who were with them came back. The Companions of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) were divided in two groups. One group said:We would kill them, and the other one said: No, this should not be done, and it was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:" Why should you, then, be two parties in relation to hypocrites?" (iv. 88).
2776.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters.
2777 | Abu Sa'id Khudri reported that during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the hypocrites behaved in this way that when Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) set out for a battle, they kept themselves behind, and they became happy that they had managed to sit in the house contrary to (the act of) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and when Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) came back, they put forward excuses and took oath and wished that people should laud them for the deeds which they had not done. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:" Think not that those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done-think not them to be safe from the chastisement; and for them is a painful chastisement" (iii. 18).
2778 | Humaid b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf reported that Marwan said to Rafi', his chamberlain, that he should go to Ibn 'Abbas and ask him:If every one of us be punished for his being happy upon his deed and for his being praised for what he has not done, nobody would be saved from the torment. Ibn 'Abbas said: What you have to do with this verse? It has been in fact revealed in connection with the people of the Book." Then Ibn Abbas recited this verse:" When Allah took a covenant from those who had been given the Book: You shall explain it to people and shall not conceal this" (iii. 186), and then Ibn 'Abbas recited this verse:" Think not that those who exult in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done" (iii. 186). Ibn 'Abbas (further) said: Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) asked them about something and then they concealed that and they told him something else and they went out and they thought that they had informed him as lie had asked them and they felt happy of what they had concealed.
2779.01 | Qais reported:I said to 'Ammar: What is your opinion about that which you have done in case (of your siding with Hadrat 'Ali)? Is it your personal opinion or something you got from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? 'Ammar said: We have got nothing from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which people at large did not get, but Hudhaifa told me that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had especially told him amongst his Companion, that there would be twelve hypocrites out of whom eight would not get into Paradise, until a camel would be able to pass through the needle hole. The ulcer would be itself sufficient (to kill) eight. So far as four are concerned, I do not remember what Shu'ba said about them.
2779.02 | Qais b. 'Ubad reported:We said to 'Ammar: Was your fighting (on the side of 'Ali in the Battle of Siffin) a matter of your own choice or you got its hints from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for it, is likely for one to err in one's own discretion or was it because of any covenant that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got from you? He said: It was not because of any covenant that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got from us which he did get from other people, and he further said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:" In my Ummah." And I think that Hudhaifa reported to me and according to Ghundar (the words are) that he said: In my Ummah, there would be twelve hypocrites and they would not be admitted to Paradise and they would not smell its odour, until the camel would pass through a needle's hole. Dubaila (ulcer) would be enough to (torment them) -a kind of flame of Fire which would appear in their shoulders and it would protrude from their chest.
2779.03 | Abu Tufail reported that there was a dispute between Hudhaifa and one from the people of Aqaba as it happens amongst people. He said:I adjure you by Allah to tell me as to how many people from Aqaba were. The people said to him (Hudhaifa) to inform him as he had asked. We have been informed that they were fourteen and If you are to be counted amongst them, then they would be fifteen and I state by Allah that twelve amongst them were the enemies of Allah and of His Messenger (ﷺ) in this world. The rest of the three put forward this excuse: We did not hear the announcement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we were not aware of the intention of the people as he (the Holy Prophet) had been in the hot atmosphere. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: The water is small in quantity (at the next station). So nobody should go ahead of me, but he found people who had gone ahead of him and he cursed them on that day.
2780.01 | Jabir b. Abdullah reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:He who climbed this hill, the hill of Murar, his sins would be obliterated as were obliterated the sins of Bani Isra'il. So the first to take their horses were the people of Banu Khazraj. Then there was a ceaseless flow of persons and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them: All of you are those who have been pardoned except the owner of a red camel. We came to him and said to him: You also come on, so that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) may seek forgiveness for you. But he said: By Allah, so far as I am concerned, the finding of something lost is dearer to me than seeking of forgiveness for me by your companion (the Holy Prophet), and he remained busy in finding out his lost thing.
2780.02 | Jabir b. Abdullah reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:He who would climb this hill of Murar. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation that it was a desert Arab who was finding out his lost thing.
2781 | Anas b. Malik reported:There was a person amongst us who belonged to the tribe of Bani Najjar and he recited Sura al-Baqarah and Surat Al-i-'Imran and he used to transcribe for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He ran away as a rebel and joined the People of the Book. They gave it much importance and said: He is the person who used to transcribe for Muhammad and they were much pleased with him. Time rolled on that Allah caused his death. They dug the grave and buried him therein, but they found to their surprise that the earth had thrown him out over the surface. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface. At last they left him unburied.
2782 | Jabir reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came back from a journey and as he was near Medina, there was such a violent gale that the mountain seemed to be pressed. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:This wind has perhaps been made to blow for the death of a hypocrite, and as he reached Medina a notorious hypocrite from amongst the hypocrites had died.
2783 | Iyas reported on the authority of his father:We went along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to visit a person suffering from fever. When I placed my hand upon him, I said: By Allah, I have never seen, till this day, a person running higher temperature than he. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), turning his face to his companions, said: May I not inform you of a severer temperature than this which these two persons would run on the Day of Resurrection? And they were two hypocrites riding upon the camel turning their back towards (the Muslims).
2784.01 | Ibn Umar reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:The similitude of a hypocrite is that of a sheep which roams aimlessly between two flocks. She goes to one at one time and to the other at another time.
2784.02 | Ibn Umar reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) saying like this but with this change of words:" She sometimes finds a way in one flock and then in another flock."
2785 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:A bulky person would be brought on the Day of judgment and he would not carry the weight to the eye of Allah equal even to that of a gnat. Nor shall We set up a balance for them on the Day of Resurrection" (xviii. 105).
2786.01 | Abdullah b. Mas'ud reported that a Jewish scholar came to Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) and said:Muhammad, or Abu al-Qasim, verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious would carry the Heavens on the Day of Judgment upon one finger and earths upon one finger and the mountains and trees upon one finger and the ocean and moist earth upon one finger, and in fact the whole of the creation upon one finger, and then He would stir them and say: I am your Lord, I am your Lord. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled testifying what that scholar had said. He then recited this verse:" And they honour not Allah with the honour due to Him; and the whole earth will be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and the heaven rolled up in His right hand. Glory be to Him I and highly Exalted is He above what they associate (with Him)" (Az-Zumar:67).
2786.02 | This hadlth has been narrated on the authority of Mansur with the same chain of truemittm (and the words are):A Jew scholar came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The rest of the hadith is the same, but there is no mention of" then He would stir them." But there is this addition:" I saw Allah's Messengcr (ﷺ) smiling so much that his front teeth appeared and testifying him (th Jew scholar) ; then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited the verse:" And they honour not Allah with the honour due to Him" (xxxix. 67).
2786.03 | Abdullah reported that a person from the People of the Book came to Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) and said:Abu al-Qasim, verily, Allah holds the Heavens upon one finger and the earths upon one finger and the trees and moist earth upon one finger and in fact the whole of the creation upon one finger and then say: I am the King. I am the King. And he (the narrator) further said: I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiling until his front teeth became visible and then he recited the verse: "And they measure not the power of Allah with His true measure" (39:67).
2786.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of A'mash with the same chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.
2787 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, will take in His grip the Earth on the Day of Judgment and He would roll up the sky in His right hand and would say: I am the Lord; where are the sovereigns of the world?
2788.01 | Abdullah b. 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying:Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would fold the Heavens on the Day of Judgment and then He would place them on His right hand and say: I am the Lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)? He would fold the' earth (placing it) on the left hand and say: I am the Lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)?
2788.02 | Abdullah b. Miqsam reported that he saw Abdullah b. Umar as he narrated Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would take in His hand His Heavens and His Earth, and would say: I am Allah. And He would clench His fingers and then would open them (and say): I am your Lord. I saw the pulpit in commotion from underneath because of something (vib-ating) there. And (I felt this commotion so much) that I said (to myself): It may not fall with Allah's Massenger (ﷺ) upon it.
2788.03 | Abdullah b. Miqsam reported that 'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported:I saw Allah'h Messenger (ﷺ) upon the pulpit and he was saying that the Mighty Lord, the Exalted and Glorious would take hold of the Heavens and earth in His hand. The rest of the hadith is the same,
2789 | Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took hold of my hands and said:Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, created the clay on Saturday and He created the mountains on Sunday and He created the trees on Monday and He created the things entailing labour on Tuesday and created light on Wednesday and He caused the animals to spread on Thursday and created Adam (peace be upon him) after 'Asr on Friday; the last creation at the last hour of the hours of Friday, i. e. between afternoon and night. This hadith is narrated through another chain of transmitters.
2790 | Sahl b. Sa'd reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:The people will be assembled on the Day of Resurrection on a white plain with a reddish tinge like the loaf of white bread with no marks set up for anyone.
2791 | 'A'isha reported:I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about the words of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious:" The day when the earth would be changed for another earth and Heaven would be changed for another Heaven (XiV. 48), (and inquired: ) (Allah's Messenger), where would the people be on that day? He said: They would be on the Sirat.
2792 | Abu al-Sa'id Khudri reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying that the earth would turn to be one single bread on the Day of Resurrection and the Almighty would turn it in His hand as one of you turns a loaf while on a journey. It would be a feast arranged in the honour of the people of Paradise. He (the narrator) further narrated that a person from among the Jews came and he said:Abu al-Qasim, may the Compassionate Lord be pleased with you! May I inform you about the feast arranged in honour of the people of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection? He said: Do it, of course. He said: The earth would become one single bread. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked towards us and laughed until his molar teeth became visible. He then again said: May I inform you about that with which they would season it? He said: Do it, of course. He said: Their seasoning would be balim and fish. The Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said: What is this balam? He said: Ox and fish from whose excessive livers seventy thousand people would be able to eat.
2793 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If ten scholars of the Jews would follow me, no Jew would be left upon the surface of the earth who would not embrace Islam.
2794.01 | `Abdullah (b. Mas`ud) reported:As I was going along with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) in a cultivable land and he (the Holy Prophet) was walking with the support of a wood, a group of Jews happened to meet him. Some of them said to the others: Ask him about the Soul. They said: What is your doubt about it? There is a possibility that you may ask him about anything (the answer of) which you may not like. They said: Ask him. So one amongst them asked him about the Soul. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept quiet and he gave no reply and I came to know that revelation was being sent to him, so I stood at my place and thus this revelation descended upon him:" They ask thee about the Soul. Say: The Soul is by the Commandment of my Lord, and of Knowledge you are given but a little" (xvii. 58).
2794.02 | Abdullah reported:I was walking along with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) in a field of Medina. The rest of the hadith is the same, but there is a slight variation of wording.
2794.03 | Abdullah reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) was reclining against a tree in the garden. The rest of the hadith is the same with a slight variation of wording.
2795.01 | Khabbab reported that Al-`As b. Wa'il owed debt to me. I came to him in order to demand that. He said:I will never repay you unless you belie Muhammad. I said: I would never belie Muhammad until you die and you are again raised up. He said: When I would be raised up after death, I would repay your debt when I would get my property and children back. Waki` said: This is how Al-A`mash has narrated and it was on this occasion that this verse was revealed: "Hast thou seen him who disbelieves in Our message and says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children" (xix, 77) up to "he would come to Us alone" (xix, 80).
2795.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Khabbib through another chain of transmitters and the words are. I in the pre-Islamic days used to work as an iron-smith. I did some work for 'As b. Wa'il and came to him for getting the remuneration of my wages.
2796 | Anas b. Malik reported that Abu Jahl said:O Allah, if he is true, then shower upon us the volley of stones from the sky or inflict upon us a grievous torment, and it was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:" 'Allah would never torment them so long as you are amongst them. And Allah is not going to torment them as long as they seek forgiveness. And why is it that Allah should not torment them and they prevent people from coming to the sacred mosque...." (viii. 34) to the end.
2797 | Abu Huraira reported that Abu Jahl asked (people) whether Muhammad placed his face (on the ground) in their presence. It was said to him:Yes. He said: By Lat and `Uzza. If I were to see him do that, I would trample his neck, or I would smear his face with dust. He came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as he was engaged in prayer and thought of trampling his neck (and the people say) that he came near him but turned upon his heels and tried to repulse something with his hands. It was said to him: What is the matter with you? He said: There is between me and him a ditch of fire and terror and wings. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: If he were to come near me the angels would have torn him to pieces. Then Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse- (the narrator) said: We do not know whether it is the hadith transmitted by Abu Huraira or something conveyed to him from another source: "Nay, man is surely inordinate, because he looks upon himself as self-sufficient. Surely to thy Lord is the return. Hast thou seen him who forbids a servant when he prays? Seest thou if he is on the right way, or enjoins observance of piety? Seest thou if he [Abu Jahl] denies and turns away? Knowest he not that Allah sees? Nay, if he desists not, We will seize him by the forelock-a lying, sinful forelock. Then let him summon his council. We will summon the guards of the Hell. Nay! Obey not thou him" (lcvi, 6-19). (Rather prostrate thyself.) Ubaidullah made this addition: It was after this that (prostration) was enjoined upon and Ibn Abd al-Ala made this addition that by "Nadiyah" he meant his people.
2798.01 | Masruq reported:We were sitting in the company of Abdullah and he was lying on the bed that a person came and said: Abd Abd al-Rabmin, a story-teller at the gates of Kinda says that the verse (of the Qur'an) which deals with the" smoke" implies that which is about to come and it would hold the breath of the infidels and would inflict the believers with cold. Thereupon Abdullah got up and said in anger. O people, fear Allah and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say which he does not know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He has the best knowledge amongst all of you. It does not behove him to say that which he does not know. Allah has the best knowledge of it. Verily Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said to His Prophet (ﷺ) to state:" I do not ask from you any remuneration and I am not the one to put you in trouble," and when Allah's Mesqenger (ﷺ) saw people turning back (from religion) he said: O Allah, afflict thern with seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were afflicted with famine by which they were forced to eat everything until they were obliged to eat the hides and the dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them looked towards the sky and he found a smoke. And Abu Sufyan came and he said: Muhammad, you have come to command us to obey Allah and cement the ties of blood- relation whereas your people are undone; supplicate Allah for tlicm. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:" Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke from the sky which would envelop people and that would be grievous torivent" up to the words:" you are going to return to (evil)." (if this verse implied the torment of the next life) could the chastisement of the next (life) be averted (as the Qur'an states): On the day when We seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We shall exact retribution" (xliv. 16)? The seizing (in the hadith) implies that of the Day of Badr. And so far as the sign of smoke, seizing, inevitability and signs of Rome are concern- ed, they have become things of the past now.
2798.02 | Masruq reported that there came to Abdullah a person and said:I have left behind in the mosque a man who explains the Qur'an according to his personal discretion and he explained this verse:" So wait for the day when the Heaven brings a clear smoke." He says that a smoke would come to the people on the Day of Resurrection anl it will withhold breath and they would be inflicted with cold. 'Abdullah said: He who has knowledge should say something and he who has no knowledge should simply say: Allah is best aware. This reflects the understanding of a person that he should say about that which he does not know that it is Allah who knows best. The fact is that when the Quraish disobeyed Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) he supplicated Allah that they should be afflicted with famine and starvation as was done in case of Yusuf. And they were so much hard pressed that a person would ace the sky and he would see between him and the sky something like smoke and they were so much hard pressed that they began to cat the bones, and a person came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger. seek forgiveness for the tribe of Mudar for (its people) have been undone. The Messenger (ﷺ) said: For Mudar? You are overbold, but he supplicated Allah for them. It was upon this that this verse was revealed:" We shall remove the chastisement a little, but they will surely return to evil" (xliv. 15). lie (the narrator) said: There was a downpoor of rain upon them. When there was some relief for them they returned to the same position as they had been before, and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" So wait for the day when the heaven brings a clear smoke enveloping people. This is a grievous torment on the day when We seize them with the most violent seizing; surely, We shall exact retribution." And this (seizing) implied (Battle) of Badr.
2798.03 | Abdullah said that five signs have (become things) of the past (and have proved the truth of the Holy Prophet):(Enveloping) by the smoke, inevitable (punishment to the Meccans at Badr), (the victory of) Rome, (violent) seizing (of the Meccans at Badr) and (the splitting up of) the Moon.
2798.04 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of A'mash with the same chain of transmitters.
2799 | Ubayy b. Ka'b reported that the words of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious:" We will, surely, make them taste the lesser punishment before the severer punishment (that haply they may return)" (xxxii. 21) imply the torments of the world. (victory of) Rome, seizing (of the Meccans), or smoke. And Shalba was in doubt about seizing or smoke.
2800.01 | Abu Ma'mar reported on the authority of Abdullah that the moon was split up during lifetime by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in two parts and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Bear testimony to this.
2800.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas'ud (who said):We were along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at Mina, that moon was split up into two. One of its parts was behind the mountain and the other one was on this side of the mountain. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upbn him) said to us: Bear witness to this.
2800.03 | 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud reported that the moon was split up in two parts during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The mountain covered one of its parts and one part of it was above the mountain and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Bear witness to this.
2801.01 | Another chain of transmitters reported the like of this hadith.
2801.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Shu'ba with a slight variation of wording.
2802.01 | Anas reported that the people of Mecca demanded from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that he should show them (some) signs (miracles) and he showed twice the splitting of the moon. This hadlth has been narrated on the authority of Anas through another chain of transmitters.
2802.03 | Anas reported that the moon was split up in two parts and in the hadith recorded in Abu Dawud, the words are:" The moon was split up into two parts during the life of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)."
2803 | Ibn 'Abbas reported that the moon was split up during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him).
2804.01 | Abu Musa reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:There is none to show more patience at listening to the most irksome things than Allah, the Exalted and Glorious. 'Partnership is associated to Him (polytheism), and (fatherhood) of a child is attributed to Him, but in spite of this He protects them (people) and provides them sustenance.' This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Musa with a slight variation of wording.
2804.03 | Abdullah b. Qais reported from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that none is more forbearing in listening to the most irksome things than Allah, the Exalted. They associate rivals with him, attribute sonhood to Him, but in spite of this He provides them sustenance, grants them safety, confers upon them so many things.
2805.01 | Anas b. Malik reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Allah, the Exalted and High, would say to one who shall have to undergo the least torture (on the Day of Resurrection): Would you like to go as ransom if you had all worldly riches; he would say: Yes. Allah would say to him: When you were in the loins of Adam, I demanded from you something easier than this that you should not associate anything with Me. (The narrator says): I think He also said: I would not cause you to enter Hell-Fire but you defied and attributed Divinity (to others besides Me).

Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be u n him) said:It would be said to the non-believers on the Day of Resurrection: If you were to possess gold, filling the whole earth, would you like to secure your freedom by paying that?

2805.04 | Anas reported this hadlth through another chain of transmitters and the words are:" It would be said to him: You have told a lie; what had been demanded from you was quite easier than this (the belief in the Oneness of Allah)."

(He adjured): By the might of our Lord.
2807 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said that one amongst the denizens of Hell who had led a life of ease and plenty amongst the people of the world would be made to dip in Fire only once on the Day of Resurrection and then it would be said to him:O, son of Adam, did you find any comfort, did you happen to get any material blessing? He would say: By Allah, no, my Lord. And then that person from amongst the persons of the world be brought who had led the most miserable life (in the world) from amongst the inmates of Paradise. and he would be made to dip once in Paradise and it would be said to him. 0, son of Adam, did you face, any hardship? Or had any distress fallen to your lot? And he would say: By Allah, no,0 my Lord, never did I face any hardship or experience any distress.
2808.01 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Verily, Allah does not treat a believer unjustly in regard to his virtues. He would confer upon him (His blessing) in this world and would give him reward in the Hereafter.

2808.02 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) thus told him:When a non-believer does good he is made to taste Its reward in this world.

2809.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The Similitude of a believer is that of (a standing) crop which the air continues to toss from one side to another; in the same way a believer always (receives the strokes) of misfortune.

2810.02 | Ka'b b. Malik reported on the authority of his father that the similitude of a believer is that of a standing crop.

They (the Companions) then said: Allah's Messenger, (kindly) tell us which that can be? Thereupon he said: It is the date-palm tree. I made a mention of that to 'Umar, whereupon he said: Had you said that it meant the date-palin tree, this statement of yours (would have been dearer to me) than such and such things.
2811.02 | Ibn Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) one day said to his Companions:Tell me about a tree which has resemblance with a believer. The people began to mention (different) trees of the forest. Ibn 'Umar said: It was instilled in my mind or in my heart and it stuck therein that it implied the date- palm tree. I made up my mind to make a mention of that but could not do that because of the presence of the elderly people there. When there was a hush amongst them (after they had expressed their views), Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: It Is the date-palm tree.
2811.03 | Mujahid said:(I have had the privilege) of accompanying Ibn 'Umar up to Medina but I did not hear him narrate anything from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) except one hadith.

Ibn Umar said: It crossed my mind that it could be the date-palm tree, but as I saw Aba Bakr and Umar observe silence, I did not deem it fit that I should speak or I should say something. 'Umar said: Had you said so, it would have been dearer to me than such and such thing.

2813.02 | Jabir reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Iblis places his throne upon water; he then sends detachments (for creating dissension) ; the nearer to him in rank are those who are most notorious in creating dissension.

Then one amongst them comes and says: "I did not spare so and so until I sowed the seed of discord between a husband and a wife." The Satan goes near him and says: "You have done well." A'mash said: He then embraces him.
2813.03 | Jabir reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upqn him) said:The Satan sends detachments of his own in order to put people to trial and the highest in rank, in his eyes, is one who is most notorious in sowing the seed of dissension.

Thereupon she said: How can it be (that a woman like me) should not feel jealous in regard to a husband like you. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: It was your devil who had come to you, and she said: Allah's Messenger, is there along with me a devil? He said: Yes. I said: Is a devil attached to everyone?

Both of you will be full. The Hell will riot be filled up until Allah puts down His foot in it. The Hell would say: Enough, enough, enough, and at that time it will be filled up, all its parts integrated together.

2846.04 | Hammam b. Munabbih reported that Abu Huraira narrated to them some ahadith of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and one of them is this that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:The Paradise and the Hell fell into dispute and the Hell said: 1 have been distinguished for accommodating (the haughty and proud in me), and the Paradise said: What is the matter that the meek and the humble and the downtrodden and simple would find an abode in me? Thereupon Allah said to Paradise: You are a (means) of My Mercy. 1 shall show mercy through you to one whom I will from amongst My servants. And lie said to the Hell: You are a (sign) of My chastisement and I shall chastise through you anyone whom I will from amongst My servants and both of you, would be full. And as regards the Hell it would not be full until Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, places His foot therein, and it would say: Enough, enough, enough, and it would be then full and the one part would draw very close to the other one and Allah would not treat unjustly anyone amongst His creation and He would create another creation for the Paradise (to accommodate it).
2847 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:The Paradise and the Hell disputed with each other. The rest of the hadith is the same as transmitted by Abu Huraira up to the words'." It is essential for Me to fill up both of you."
2848.01 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said that the Hell would continue to say:Is there anything more, until Allah, the Exalted and High, would place His foot therein and that would say: Enough, enough, by Your Honour, and some parts of it would draw close to the other.
2848.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Anas through another chain of transmitters.
2848.03 | 'Abd al-Wahhab b. Ata' reported in connection with the words of Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious:We would say to Hell on the Day of Ressurection: Have you been completely filled up? and it would say: Is there anything -more? And he stated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: (The sinners) would be thrown therein and it would continue to say: Is there anything more, until Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would keep His foot there- in and some of its part would draw close to the other and it would say: Enough, enough, by Thy Honour and by Thy Dignity, and there would be enough space in Paradise until Allah would create a new creation and He would make them accommo- date that spare place in Paradise.

2849.01 | Abu Sa'id reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Death would be brought on the Day of Resurrection. in the form of a white-coloured ram. Abu Kuraib made this addition: Then it would be made to stand between the Paradise and the Hell. So far as the rest of the hadith is concerned there is perfect agreement (between the two narrators) and it would be said to the inmates of Paradise: Do you recognise this? They would raise up their necks and look towards it and say: Yes, ' it is death. Then it would be said to the inmates of Hell-Fire.. Do you recognise this? And they would raise up their necks and look and say: Yes, it is death. Then command would be given for slaughtering that and then it would be said: 0 inmates of Paradise,, there is an everlasting life for you and no death. And then (addressing) to the inmates of the Hell-Fire, it would be said: 0 inmates of Hell-Fire, there is an everlasting living for you and no death. Allah's Messenger (may peace be u@on him) then recited this verse pointing with his hand to this (material) world:" Warn them, this Day of dismay, and when their affairs would be decided and they would be un- mindful and they believe not" (xix. 39).
2849.02 | Abu Sa'id reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:When the inmates of Paradise would be admitted to Paradise and the inmates of Hell would be admitted to Hell, it would be said (to the inmates of Paradise): 0 inmates of Paradise. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation (that he only) said. That is the word of Allah, the Exalted. And he did not say: Then Allah's Mes- senger (ﷺ) recited, and he did not make a mention of his having pointed with his hand towards the (material) world.
2850.01 | Abdullah reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Allah would admit the inmates of Paradise into Paradise and the inmates of Hell into Hell.

2851 | It is transmitted on the authority of Abu Huraira that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:The molar tooth of an unbeliever or the canine teeth of an unbeliever will be like Uhud and the thickness of his skin a three night's journey.

He then said: May I not inform you about the denizens of Hell-Fire? They said: Yes. And he said: Every haughty, fat and proud (person).

Zam'a reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) delivered an address and he made a mention of the dromedary and also made a mention of one (base person) who cut off Its hind legs, and he recited:" When the basest of them broke forth with mischief" (xei. 12).

He then delivered instruction in regard to the women saying: There is amongst you who beats his woman, and in the narration on the authority of Abu Bakr, the words are: He flogs her like a slave-girl. And in the narration of Abu Kuraib (the words are): He flogs like a slave and then comforts his bed with the help of that at the end of the day, and he then advised in regard to laughing of people at the breaking of wind and said: One of you laughs at that which you yourself do.

Musayyib explained" al-bahira" as that animal which is not milked but for the idols. and none amongst the people milks them, and" as-sa'iba" as that animal which is let loose for the deities.

'Amir al-Khuzili dragging his intestines in fire and he was the first who devoted animals to deity.
2128.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Two are the types amongst the denizens of Hell, the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox and they flog people with their help.

2865.01 | 'Iyad b. Him-ar reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), while delivering a sermon one day, said:Behold, my Lord commanded me that I should teach you which you do not know and which He has taught me today.

I have created My servants as one having a natural inclination to the worship of Allah but it is Satan who turns them away from the right religion and he makes unlawful what has been declared lawful for them and he commands them to ascribe partnership with Me, although he has no justification for that. And verily, Allah looked towards the people of the world and He showed hatred for the Arabs and the non-Arabs, but with the exception of some remnants from the People of the Book. And He (further) said: I have sent thee (the Holy Prophet) in order to put you to test and put (those to test) through you. And I sent the Book to you which cannot be washed away by water, so that you may recite it while in the state of wakefulness or sleep. Verily, Allah commanded me to burn (kill) the Quraish. I said: My Lord, they would break my head (like the tearing) of bread, and Allah said: You turn them out as they turned you out, you fight against them and We shall help you in this, you should spend and you would be conferred upon. You send an army and I would send an army five times greater than that. Fight against those who disobey you along with those who obey you. The inmates of Paradise are three: One who wields authority and is just and fair, one who Is truthful and has been endowed with power to do good deeds. And the person who is merciful and kind hearted towards his relatives and to every pious Muslim, and one who does not stretch his hand in spite of having a large family to support. And He said: The inmates of Hell are five: the weak who lack power to (avoid evil), the (carefree) who pursue (everything irrespective of the fact that it is good or evil) and who do not have any care for their family or for their wealth. And those dishonest whose greed cannot be concealed even in the case of minor things. And the third. who betray you. morning and evening, in regard to your family and your property.

Qatada said: Abu Abdullah, would this happen? Thereupon he said: Yes.

He said: These people are passing through the ordeal in the graves. If it were not the reason that you would stop burying (your dead) in the graves on listening to the torment in the grave which I am listening to, I would have certainly made you hear that. Then turning his face towards us, he said: Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of Hell. They said: We seek refuge with Allah from the torment of Hell. He said: Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave. They said: We seek refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave.

If he is a believer, he would say: I bear testimony to the fact that he is a servant of Allah and His Messenger. Then it would be said to him: Look to your seat in the Hellfire, for Allah has substituted (the seat of yours) with a seat in Paradise. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He would be shown both the seats. Qatada said: It was mentioned to us that his grave (the grave of a believer) expands to seventy cubits and is full with verdure until the Day when they would be resurrected.

And it is carried (by the angels) to its Lord, the Exalted and Glorious. He would say: Take it to its destined end. And if he is a nonbeliever and as it (the soul) leaves the body-Hammad made a mention of its foul smell and of its being cursed-the dwellers of the sky say: There comes a dirty soul from the side of the earth, and it would be said: Take it to its destined end.

And I was a man with sharp eye- sight, so I could see it, but none except me saw it. I began to say to 'Umar: Don't you see it? But he would not see it. Thereupon Umar said: I would soon be able to see it (when it will shine more brightly). I lay upon bed.

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then went to them and said: O, so and so, the son of so and so; O so and so, the son of so and so, have you found correct what Allah and His Messenger had promised you? I have, however, found absolutely true what Allah had promised with me. Umar said: Allah's Messenger, how are you talking with the bodies without soul in them. Thereupon he said: You cannot hear more distinctly than (their hearing) of what I say, but with this exception that they have not power to make any reply.

Rabi'a, have you not found what your Lord had promised with you to be correct? As for me, I have found the promises of my Lord to be (perfectly) correct. Umar listened to the words of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, how do they listen and respond to you? They are dead and their bodies have decayed. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, what I am saying to them, even you cannot hear more distinctly than they, but they lack the power to reply. Then'he commanded that they should be buried in the well of Badr.

2883.02 | Abdullah b. Safwan reported the Mother of the Faithful as saying that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:They would soon seek protection in this House, viz. Ka'ba (the defenceless), people who would have nothing to protect themselves in the shape of weapons or the strength of the people. An army would be sent to fight (and kill) them and when they would enter a plain ground the army would be sunk in it. Yusuf (one of the narrators) said: It was a people of Syria (hordes of Hajjaj) who had been on that day coming towards Mecca for an attack (on 'Abdulllah b. Zubair) and Abdullah b. Safwan said: By God, it does not imply this army.
2884 | 'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was startled in the state of sleep. We said:Allah's Messenger, you have done something in the state of your sleep which you never did before, Thereupon he said: Strange it is that some people of my Ummah would attack the House (Ka'ba) (for killing) a person who would belong to the tribe of the Quraish and he would try to seek protection in the House. And when they would reach the plain ground they would be sunk. We said: Allah's Messenger, all sorts of people throng the path. Thereupon he said: Yes, there would be amongst them people who would come with definite designs and those who would come under duress and there would be travellers also, but they would all be destroyed through one (stroke) of destruction. though they would be raised in different states (on the Day of Resurrection). Allah would, however, raise them according to their intention.

2886.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Huraira but with this variation of wording that in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Bakr, there is an addition of these words:" There is a prayer among prayers ('Asr) and one who misses it is as if his family and property have been ruined."
2886.03 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:There would be turmoil and the one who would sleep would be better than who would be awake and the one who would be awake would be better than one who would stand and one who would stand would be better than one who would run.

2887.01 | Abu Bakra reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:There would soon be turmoil. Behold! there would be turmoil in which the one who would be seated would be better than one who would stand and the one who would stand would be better than one who would run. Behold! when the turmoil comes or it appears, the one who has camel should stick to his camel and he who has sheep or goat should stick to his sheep and goat and he who has land should stick to the land. A person said: 'Allah's Messenger, what is your opinion about one who has neither camel nor sheep nor land? Thereupon, he said: He should take hold of his sword and beat its edge with the help of stone and then try to find a way of escape. O Allah, I have conveyed (Thy Message) ; O Allah, I have conveyed (Thy Message) ; O Allah, I have conveyed (Thy Message). A person said: Allah's Messenger, what is your opinion if I am drawn to a rank in spite of myself, or in one of the groups and made to march and a man strikes with his sword or there comes an arrow and kills me? Thereupon he said: He will bear the punishment of his sin and that of yours and he would be one amongst the denizens of Hell.
2887.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Waki' with a slight variation of wording.
2888.01 | Ahnaf b. Qais reported:I set out with the intention of helping this person (Hadrat 'Ali) when Abu Bakra met me. He said: Ahnaf, where do you intend to go? I said: I intend to help the cousin of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), viz. 'Ali. Thereupon he said to me: Ahnaf, go back, for I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: When two Muslims confront one another with swords (in hand) both the slayer and the slain would be in Fire. He (Ahnaf) said: I said, or it was said: Allah's Messenger, it may be the case of one who kills. but what about the slain (why he would be put in Hell-Fire)? Thereupon he said: He also intended to kill his companion.
2888.02 | Ahnaf b. Qais reported on the authority of Abu Bakra that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:When two Muslims confront each other with their swords, both the slayer and the slain are doomed to Hell-Fire.

157.09 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) many ahadith and one of them was this:The last Hour will not come until the two parties (of Muslims) confront each other and there is a large-scale massacre amongst them and the claim of both of them is the same.

2889.01 | Thauban reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Allah drew the ends of the world near one another for my sake. And I have seen its eastern and western ends. And the dominion of my Ummah would reach those ends which have been drawn near me and I have been granted the red and the white treasure and I begged my Lord for my Ummah that it should not be destroyed because of famine, nor be dominated by an enemy who is not amongst them to take their lives and destroy them root and branch, and my Lord said: Muhammad, whenever I make a decision, there is none to change it. I grant you for your Ummah that it would not be destroyed by famine and it would not be dominated by an enemy who would not be amongst it and would take their lives and destroy them root and branch even if all the people from the different parts of the world join hands together (for this purpose), but it would be from amongst them, viz. your Ummah, that some people would kill the others or imprison the others.
2889.02 | Thauban reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said. Verily, Allah drew the ends of the world near me until I saw its east and west, and He bestowed upon me two treasures, the red and the white. The rest of the hadith is the same.

He passed by the mosque of Banu Mu'awiya, went in and observed two rak'ahs there and we also observed prayer along with him and he made a long supplication to his Lord. He then came to us and said:I asked my Lord three things and He has granted me two but has withheld one. I begged my Lord that my Ummah should not be destroyed because of famine and He granted me this. And I begged my Lord that my Ummah should not be destroyed by drowning (by deluge) and He granted me this. And I begged my Lord that there should be no bloodshed among the people of my Ummah, but He did not grant it.
2890.02 | Amir b. Sa'd reported on the authority of his father that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came with a group of his Companions and he passed by the mosque of Banu Mu'awiya. The rest of the hadith is the same.
2891.01 | Hudhaifa b. al-Yaman reported:By Allah, I have the best knowledge amongst people about every turmoil which is going to appear in the period intervening me and the Last Hour; and it is not for the fact that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told me something confidentially pertaining to it and he did not tell anybody else about it, but it is because of the fact that I was present in the assembly in which he had been describing the turmoil. and he especially made a mention of three turmoils which would not spare anything and amongst these there would be turmoils like storms in the hot season. Some of them would be violent and some of them would be comparatively mild. Hudhaifa said: All (who were present) except I have gone (to the next world).
2891.02 | Hudhaifa reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood before us one day and he did not leave anything unsaid (that he had to say) at that very spot which would happen (in the shape of turmoil) up to the Last Hour. Those who had to remember them preserved them in their minds and those who could not remember them forgot them. My friends knew them and there are certain things which slip out of my mind, but I recapitulate them when anyone makes a mention of them just as a person is lost from one's mind but is recalled to him on seeing his face.
2891.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of A'mash with the same chain of transmitters up to the words:And he forgot who had to forget that and. he did not make a mention of what follows after this.

He then again came down and observed the prayer and again mounted the pulpit and addressed us until the sun was set and he informed (about) everything (pertaining to turmoil) that lay hidden in the past and what lies in (the womb) of) the future and the most learned amongst us is one who remembers them well
144.04 | Hudhaifa reported:We were one day in the company of 'Umar that he said: Who amongst you has preserved in his mind most perfectly the hadith of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in regard to the turmoil as he told about it? I said: It is I. Thereupon he said: You are bold (enough to make this claim). And he further said: How? I said: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: There would (first) be turmoil for a person in regard to his family, his property, his own self, his children, his neighbours (and the sins committed in their connection) would be expiated by fasting, prayer, charity, enjoining good and prohibiting evil. Thereupon 'Umar said: I do not mean (that turmoil on a small scale) but that one which would emerge like the mounting waves of the ocean. I said: Commander of the Faithful, you have nothing to do with it, for the door is closed between you and that. He said: Would that door be broken or opened? I said: No, it would be broken. Thereupon he said: Then it would not be closed despite best efforts. We said to Hudhaifa: Did Umar know the door? Thereupon he said: Yes, he knew it (for certain) just as one knows that night precedes the next day. And I narrated to him something in which there was nothing fabricated. Shaqiq (one of the narrators) said: We dared not ask Hudhaifa about that door. So we requested Masruq to ask him. So he asked him and he said: (By that door, he meant) 'Umar.
144.05 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Hudhaifa through other chains of transmitters also.
144.06 | Hudhaifa reported that Umar said:Who would narrate to us (the ahadith pertaining to turmoil) and he reported a hadith similar to these ahadith.
2893 | Jundub reported:I came on the day of Jara`a that a person was (found) sitting. I said: They would shed their blood today. That person said: By Allah. not at all. I said: By Allah, of course, they would do it. He said: By Allah, they would not do it. I said: By Allah, of course, they would do it. He said: By Allah, they would not do it, and I have heard a hadith of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which I am narrating to you in this connection. I said: You are a bad seat fellow. I have been opposing you since morning and you are listening to me in spite of the fact that you have heard a hadith from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) (contrary to my statement). I myself felt that there was no use of this annoyance. (He could tell me earlier that it was a hadith of the Prophet (may peace be upon him], and I would not have opposed him at all.) I turned my face toward him and asked him and he was Hadrat Hudhaifa.
2894.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The Last Hour would not come before the Euphrates uncovers a mountain of gold, for which people would fight.

2895 | `Abdullah b. Harith b. Naufal reported:I was standing along with Ubayy b. Ka`b and he said: The opinions of the people differ in regard to the achievement of worldly ends. I said: Yes, of course. Thereupon he said: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: The Euphrates would soon uncover a mountain of gold and when the people would bear of it they would flock towards it but the people who would possess that (treasure) (would say): If we allow these persons to take out of it they would take away the whole of it. So they would fight and ninety-nine out of one hundred would be killed. Abu Kamil in his narration said: I and Ubayy b. Ka`b stood under the shade of the battlement of Hassan.
2896 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Iraq would withhold its dirhams and qafiz; Syria would withhold its mudd and dinar and Egypt would withhold its irdab and dinar and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would recoil to that position from where you started, the flesh and blood of Abu Huraira would bear testimony to it.
2897 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The Last Hour would not come until the Romans would land at al-A'maq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of the earth at that time will come from Medina (to counteract them). When they will arrange themselves in ranks, the Romans would say: Do not stand between us and those (Muslims) who took prisoners from amongst us. Let us fight with them; and the Muslims would say: Nay, by Allah, we would never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may fight them. They will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A third (part of the army) which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah's eye, would be killed and the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of Constantinople. And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your family. They would then come out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks. Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of Mary would descend and would lead them. When the enemy of Allah would see him, it would (disappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by his hand and he would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).
2898.01 | Mustaurid al-Qurashi reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: The Last Hour would come (when) the Romans would form a majority amongst people. 'Amr said to him (Mustaurid Qurashi): See what you are saying? He said: I say what I heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Thereupon he said: If you say that, it is a fact for they have four qualities. They have the patience to undergo a trial and immediately restore themselves to sanity after trouble and attack again after flight. They (have the quality) of being good to the destitute and the orphans, to the weak and, fifthly, the good quality in them is that they put resistance against the oppression of kings.
2898.02 | Mustaurid Qurashi reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: The Last Hour would come when the Romans would form a majority amongst people. This reached 'Amr b. al-'As and he said: What are these ahadith which are being transmitted from you and which you claim to have heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? Mustaurid said to him: I stated only that which I heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Thereupon 'Amr said: If you state this (it is true), for they have the power of tolerance amongst people at the time of turmoil and restore themselves to sanity after trouble, and are good amongst people so far as the destitute and the weak are concerned.
2899.01 | Yusair b. Jabir reported:Once there blew a red storm in Kufah that there came a person who had nothing to say but (these words): `Abdullah b. Mas`ud, the Last Hour has come. He (`Abdullah b. Mas`ud) was sitting reclining against something, and he said: The Last Hour would not come until shares of inheritance are not distributed and there is no rejoicing over spoils of war. Then he said pointing towards Syria, with the gesture of his hand like this: The enemy shall muster strength against Muslims and the Muslims will muster strength against them (Syrians). I said: You mean Rome? And he said: Yes, and there would be a terrible fight and the Muslims would prepare a detachment (for fighting unto death) which would not return but victorious. They will fight until night will intervene them; both the sides will return without being victorious and both will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious. When it would be the fourth day, a new detachment out of the remnant of the Muslims would be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy should be routed. And they would fight such a fight the like of which would not be seen, so much so that even if a bird were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the end of them. (There would be such a large scale massacre) that when counting would be done, (only) one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive. So what can be the joy at the spoils of such war and what inheritance would be divided! They would be in this very state that they would hear of a calamity more horrible than this. And a cry would reach them: The Dajjal has taken your place among your offspring. They will, therefore, throw away what would be in their hands and go forward sending ten horsemen, as a scouting party. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I know their names and the names of their forefathers and the color of their horses. They will be the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day or amongst the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day.
2899.02 | Jabir reported:I was in the company of Ibn Mas'ud that there blew a red storm. The rest of the hadith is the same.
2899.03 | Jabir reported:I was in the house of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud and the house was fully packed that a red storm blew in Kufah.
2900 | Nafi' b. Utba reported:We were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in an expedition that there came a people to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) from the direction of the west. They were dressed in woollen clothes and they stood near a hillock and they met him as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was sitting. I said to myself: Better go to them and stand between him and them that they may not attack him. Then I thought that perhaps there had been going on secret negotiation amongst them. I however, went to them and stood between them and him and I remember four of the words (on that occasion) which I repeat (on the fingers of my hand) that he (Allah's Messenger) said: You will attack Arabia and Allah will enable you to conquer it, then you would attack Persia and He would make you to conquer it. Then you would attack Rome and Allah will enable you to conquer it, then you would attack the Dajjal and Allah will enable you to conquer him. Nafi' said: Jabir, we thought that the Dajjal would appear after Rome (Syrian territory) would be conquered.
2901.01 | Hudhaifa b. Usaid al-Ghifari reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to us all of a sudden as we were (busy in a discussion). He said: What do you discuss about? They (the Companions) said. We are discussing about the Last Hour. Thereupon he said: It will not come until you see ten signs before and (in this connection) he made a mention of the smoke, Dajjal, the beast, the rising of the sun from the west, the descent of Jesus son of Mary (Allah be pleased with him), the Gog and Magog, and land-slides in three places, one in the east, one in the west and one in Arabia at the end of which fire would burn forth from the Yemen, and would drive people to the place of their assembly.
2901.02 | Hudhaifa b. Usaid reported:Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) was in an apartment and we were beneath that, that he peeped in and said to us: What are you discussing about? We said: (We are discussing about the Last) Hour. Thereupon he said: The Last Hour would not come until the ten signs appear: land-sliding in the east, and land-sliding in the west, and land-sliding in the peninsula of Arabia, the smoke, the Dajjal, the beast of the earth, Gog and Magog, the rising of the sun from the west and the fire which would emit from the lower part of 'Adan. Shu'ba said that 'Abd al-'Aziz b. Rufai' reported on the authority of Abu Tufail who reported on the authority of Abu Sariha a hadith like this that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) did not make a mention of (the tenth sign) but he said that out of the ten one was the descent of Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him), and in another version it is the blowing of the violent gale which would drive the people to the ocean.
2901.03 | Abu Sariha reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in an (upper) apartment and we were standing lower to him and discussing (about the Last Hour). The rest of the hadith is the same, and Shu'ba said: I think he also said these words: The fire would descend along with them where they would land and where they would take rest (during midday (it would also cool down for a while). Shu'ba said: This hadith has been transmitted to me through Abu Tufail and Abu Sariha and none could trace it back directly to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). However, there is a mention of the descent of Jesus Christ son of Mary in one version and in the other there is a mention of the blowing of a violent gale which would drive them to the ocean.
2901.04 | Another chain of transmitters reports the like of the previous two chains. Abu Sariha reported:We were discussing (the Last Hour) that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) looked towards us. The rest of the hadith is the same and the tenth (sign) was the descent of Jesus Christ son of Mary, and Shu'ba said: 'Abd al-'Aziz did not trace it directly to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ).

2907.01 | 'A'isha reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: The (system) of night and day would not end until the people have taken to the worship of Lat and 'Uzza. I said: Allah's Messenger, I think when Allah has revealed this verse:" He it is Who has sent His Messenger with right guidance, and true religion, so that He may cause it to prevail upon all religions, though the polytheists are averse (to it)" (ix. 33), it implies that (this promise) is going to be fulfilled. Thereupon he (Allah's Apostle) said: It would happen as Allah would like. Then Allah would send the sweet fragrant air by which everyone who has even a mustard grain of faith in Him would die and those only would survive who would have no goodness in them. And they would revert to the religion of their forefathers.

'Abdullah that he said it may happen that the people of Iraq may not send their qafiz and dirhams (their measures of food stuff and their money). We said: Who would be responsible for it? He said: The non-Arabs would prevent them. He again said: There is the possibility that the people of Syria may not send their dinars and mudds. We said: Who would be responsible for it? He said this prevention would be made by the Romans. He (Jabir b. Abdullah) kept quiet for a while and then reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said there would be a caliph in the last (period) of my Ummah who would freely give handfuls of wealth to the people without counting it. I said to Abu Nadra and Abu al-'Ala: Do you mean 'Umar b. 'Abd al-Aziz? They said: No (he would be Imam Mahdi).

When they would land there, they will neither fight with weapons nor would shower arrows but would only say: "There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest," and one side of it would fall. Thaur (one of the narrators) said: I think that he said: The part by the side of the ocean. Then they would say for the second time: "There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest" and the second side would also fall, and they would say: "There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest," and the gates would be opened for them and they would enter therein and, they would be collecting spoils of war and distributing them amongst themselves when a noise would be heard saying: Verily, Dajjal has come.

Thereupon he said: No, but you should bear testimony that I am the messenger of Allah. Thereupon 'Umar b. Khattab said: Allah's Messenger, permit me that I should kill him. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: If he is that person who is in your mind (Dajjal ), you will not be able to kill him.
2924.02 | 'Abdullah reported:We were walking with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that Ibn Sayyad happened to pass by him. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: I have concealed for you (something to test you, so tell me that). He said: It is Dukh. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: Be off. You cannot get farther than your rank, whereupon 'Umar said: Allah's Messenger, permit me to strike his neck. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Leave him; if he is that one (Dajjal) whom you apprehend, you will not be able to kill him.

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I affirm my faith in Allah and in His Angels and in His Books, and what do you see? He said: I see the throne over water. Whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: You see the throne of Iblis upon the water, and what else do you see? He said: I see two truthfuls and a liar or two liars and one truthful. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Leave him He has been confounded.
2926 | Jabir b 'Abdullah reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) met Ibn Sa'id (Sayyad) and there were with him Abu Bakr and 'Umar and Ibn Sayyad was in the company of children. The rest of the hadith is the same.
2927.01 | Abu Sa'id reported:I accompanied Ibn Sayyad to Mecca and he said to me: What I have gathered from people is that they think that I am Dajjal. Have you not heard Allah's Messenger (may peace upon him) as saying: He will have no children, I said: Yes, of course. Thereupon he said: But I have children. Have you not heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: He would not enter Mecca and Medina? I said: Yes, of course. Thereupon he said I have been once in Medina and now I intend to go to Mecca. And he said to me at the end of his talk: By Allah, I know his place of birth his abode where he is just now. He (Abu Sa'id) said: This caused confusion in my mind (in regard to his identity).
2927.02 | Abu Sa'id Khudri reported:Ibn Sa'id said to me something for which I felt ashamed. He said: I can excuse others; but what has gone wrong with you, O Companions of Muhammad, that you take me as Dajjal? Has Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) not said that he would be a Jew whereas I am a Muslim and he also said that he would not have children, whereas I have children, and he also said: verily, Allah has prohibited him to enter Mecca whereas I have performed Pilgrimage, and he went on saying this that I was about to be impressed by his talk. He (however) said this also: I know where he (Dajjal) is and I know his father and mother, and it was said to him: Won't you feel pleased if you would be the same person? Thereupon he said: If this offer is made to me, I would not resent that.
2927.03 | Abu Sa`id al-Khudri reported:We came back after having performed Pilgrimage or `Umra and lbn Sa'id was along with us. And we encamped at a place and the people dispersed and I and he were left behind. I felt terribly frightend from him as it was said about him that he was the Dajjal. He brought his goods and placed them by my luggage and I said: It is intense heat. Would you not place that under that tree? And he did that. Then there appeared before us a flock of sheep. He went and brought a cup of milk and said: Abu Sa`id, drink that. I said it is intense heat and the milk is also hot (whereas the fact was) that I did not like to drink from his hands or to take it from his hand and he said: Abu Sa`id, I think that I should take a rope and suspend it by the tree and then commit suicide because of the talks of the people, and he further said. Abu Sa`id he who is ignorant of the saying of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (he is to be pardoned), but O people of Ansar, is this hadith of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) concealed from you whereas you have the best knowledge of the hadith of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) amongst people? Did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) not say that he (Dajjal) would be a non believer whereas I am a believer? Did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) not say he would be barren and no child would be born to him, whereas I have left my children in Medina? Did Allah's Messenger (may peace upon him) not say: He would not get into Medina and Mecca whereas I have been coming from Medina and now I intend to go to Mecca? Abu Sa`id said: I was about to accept the excuse put forward by him. Then he said: I know the place where he would be born and where he is now. So I said to him: May your whole day be spent.
2928.01 | This hadith has transmitted on the authority of Abu Sa'id that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked Ibn Sa'id about the earth of Paradise. Thereupon he said:Abu'l-Qasim, It is like a fine white musk, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: 'You have told the the truth.
2928.02 | Abu Sa'id reported that Ibn Sayyad asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about the earth of Paradise. Whereupon he said:It is like white shining pure musk.
2929 | 'Muhammad b. Munkadir reported:As I saw Jabir b. 'Abdullah taking an oath in the name of Allah that it was Ibn Sa'id who was the Dajjal I said: Do you take an oath in the name of Allah? Thereupon he said: I heard 'Umar taking an oath in the presence of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) to this effect but Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) did not disapprove of it.
2930.01 | 'Abdullah b. Umar reported:'Umar b. Khattab went along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the company of some persons to Ibn Sayyad that he found him playing with children near the battlement of Bani Maghala and Ibn Sayyad was at that time just at the threshold of adolescence and he did not perceive (the presence of Holy Prophet) until Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) struck his back with his hands. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Ibn Sayyad, don't you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and he said: I bear witness to the fact that you the messenger of the unlettered. Ibn Sayyad said to the Allah's Messenger (ﷺ): Do you bear witness to the fact that I am the messenger of Allah? Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rejected this and said: I affirm my faith in Allah and in His messengers. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: What do you see? Ibn Sayyad said: It is a Dukh. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: May you be disgraced and dishonoured, you would not not be able to go beyond your rank. 'Umar b. Khattab said: Allah's Messenger, permit me that I should strike his neck. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and if he is not that there is no good for you to kill him. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar further narrated that after some time Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Ubayy b. Ka'b went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw him on a bed with a blanket around him from which a murmuring sound was being heard and Ibn Sayyad's mother saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said to Ibn Sayyad: Saf (that being his name), here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn Sayyad jumped up murmuring and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: If she had left him alone he would have made things clear. Abdullah b. Umar told that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up amongst the people and lauded Allah as He deserved, then he made a mention of the Dajjal and said: I warn you of him and there is no Prophet who has not warned his people against the Dajjal. Even Noah warned (against him) but I am going to tell you a thing which no Prophet told his people. You must know that he (the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed. Ibn Shihab said: 'Umar b. Thabit al-Ansari informed me that some of the Companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) informed him that the day when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) warned people against the Dajjal, he also said: There would be written between his two eyes (the word) Kafir (infidel) and everyone who would resent his deeds would be able to read or every Muslim would be about to read, and he also said: Bear this thing in mind that none amongst you would be able to see Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, until he dies.
2930.02 | Abdullah b. Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went along with him in the company of some persons and there was Umar b. Khattab also amongst them till they saw Ibn Sayyad as a young boy just on the threshold of adolescence playing with children near the battlement of Bani Mu'awiya; the rest of the hadith is the same but with these concluding words:" Had his mother left him (to murmur) his matter would have become clear."
2930.03 | Ibn 'Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) happened to pass by Ibn Sayyad along with his Companions including 'Umar b. Khattab as he was playing with children near the battlement of Bani Maghala and he was also a child by that time. The rest of the hadith is the same as narrated by Ibn Umar (in which there is a mention of) setting out of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) along with Ubayy b. Ka'b towards the date-palm trees.
2932.01 | Nafi' reported that Ibn 'Umar met Ibn Si'id on some of the paths of Medina and he said to him a word which enraged him and he was so much swollen with anger that the way was blocked. Ibn 'Umar went to Hafsa and informed her about this. Thereupon she said:May Allah have mercy upon you, why did you incite Ibn Sayyad in spite of the fact that you knew it would be the extreme anger which would make Dajjal appear in the world?
2932.02 | Nafi' reported that Ibn 'Umar said:I met lbn Sayyad twice and said to some of them (his friends): You state that it was he (the Dajjal). He said: By Allah, it is not so. I said: You have not told me the truth; by Allah some of you informed me that he would not die until he would have the largest number of offspring and huge wealth and it is he about whom it is thought so. Then Ibn Sayyad talked to us. I then departed and met him again for the second time and his eye had been swollen. I said: What has happened to your eye? He said: I do not know. I said: This is in your head and you do not know about it? He said: If Allah so wills He can create it (eye) in your staff. He then produced a sound like the braying of a donkey. Some of my companions thought that I had struck him with the staff as he was with me that the staff broke into pieces, but, by Allah, I was not conscious of it. He then came to the Mother of the Faithful (Hafsa) and narrated it to her and she said: What concern you have with him? Don't you know that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said that the first thing (by the incitement of which) he would come out before the public would be his anger?
169.05 | Ibn Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). made a mention of Dajjal in the presence of the people and said:Allah is not one-eyed and behold that Dajjal is blind of the right eye and his eye would be like a floating grape.
169.06 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Umar through another chain of transmitters.
2933.01 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:There is never a prophet who has not warned the Ummah of that one-eyed liar; behold he is one-eyed and your Lord is not one-eyed. On his forehead are the letters k f. r. (Kafir).
2933.02 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:There would be written three letters k. f. r., i. e. Kafir, between the eyes of the Dajjal.
2933.03 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Dajjal is blind of one eye and there is written between his eyes the word" Kafir". He then spelled the word as k. f. r., which every Muslim would be able to read.
2934.01 | Hudhaifa reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Dajjal is blind of left eye with thick hair and there would be a garden and fire with him and his fire would be a garden and his garden would be fire.
2934.02 | It was narrated that Hudhaifah said:The Messenger of Allah said: 'I know what the Dajjal will have with him. He will have two flowing rivers, one that appears to the eye to be clear water, and one that appears to the eye to be flaming fire. If anyone sees that, let him go to the river which he thinks is fire and close his eyes, then lower his head and drink from it, for it is cool water. The Dajjal has one blind eye, with a layer of thick skin over it, and between his eyes is written "disbeliever," which every believer will read, whether he is literate or illiterate.'
2934 | Hudhaifa reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:the Dajjal would have with him water and fire and his fire would have the effect of cold water and his water would have the effect of fire, so don't put yourself to ruin. Abu Mas'ud reported: I also heard it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
2935.01 | 'Uqba b. 'Amr Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari reported:I went to Hudhaifa b. Yaman and said to him: Narrate what you have heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) pertaining to the Dajjal. He said that the Dajjal would appear and there would be along with him water and fire and what the people would see as water that would be fire and that would burn and what would appear as fire that would be water and any one of you who would see that should plunge in that which he sees as fire for it would be sweet, pure water, and 'Uqba said: I also heard it, testifying Hudhaifa.
2935.02 | Hudhaifa and Ibn Mas'ud met together. Hudhaifa said:I know more than you as to what there would be along with the Dajjal. There would be along with him two canals (one flowing with water) and the other one (having) fire (within it), and what you would see as fire would be water and what you would see as water would be fire. So he who amongst you is able to see that and is desirous of water should drink out of that which he sees as fire.
2936 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:May I not inform you about the Dajjal what no Apostle of Allah narrated to his people? He would be blind and he would bring along with him an Image of Paradise and Hell-Fire and what he would call as Paradise that would be Hell-Fire and I warn you as Noah warned his people.
2937.01 | An-Nawwas b. Sam`an reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made a mention of the Dajjal one day in the morning. He (ﷺ) sometimes described him to be insignificant and sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant (and we felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees. When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in our faces, he (ﷺ) said:What is the matter with you? We said: Allah's Messenger, you made a mention of the Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes very important, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of the cluster of the date-palm trees. Thereupon he (ﷺ) said: I harbor fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among you, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a young man with twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to `Abd-ul-`Uzza b. Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii). He would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah's Messenger, how long would he stay on the earth? He (ﷺ) said: For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and one day like a week and the rest of the days would be like your days. We said: Allah's Messenger, would one day's prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon he (ﷺ) said: No, but you must make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah's Messenger, how quickly would he walk upon the earth? Thereupon he (ﷺ) said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He would come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the earth and it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their pasturing animals would come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He would then come to another people and invite them. But they would reject him and he would go away from them and there would be drought for them and nothing would be left with them in the form of wealth. He would then walk through the waste land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He would then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at a distance which is generally) between the archer and his target. He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would be at this very time that Allah would send Jesus, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odor of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur. And then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tiberias and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his companions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the head of the ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinars and Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person. Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then come down to the earth and they would not find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like those of Bactrian camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will. Then Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels' hairs would keep out and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able to drink it. And the milch camel would give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.
2937.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jabir with the same chain of transmitters but with this addition that Gog and Magog would walk until they would reach the mountain of al-Khamar and it is a mountain of Bait-ul-Maqdis and they would say:We have killed those who are upon the earth. Let us now kill those who are In the sky and they would throw their arrows towards the sky and the arrows would return to them besmeared with blood. And in the narration of Ibn Hujr (the words are):" I have sent such persons (Gog and Magog) that none would dare fight against them.
2938.01 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) one day gave a detailed account of the Dajjal and in that it was also included:He would come but would not be allowed to enter the mountain passes to Medina. So he will alight at some of the barren tracts near Medina, and a person who would be the best of men or one from amongst the best of men would say to him: I bear testimony to the fact that you are Dajjal about whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had informed us. The Dajjal would say: What is your opinion if I kill this (person), then I bring him back to life; even then will you harbour doubt in this matter? They would say: No. He would then kill (the man) and then bring him back to life. When he would bring that person to life, he would say: By Allah, I had no better proof of the fact (that you are a Dajjal) than at the present time (that you are actually so). The Dajjal would then make an attempt to kill him (again) but he would not be able to do that. Abu Ishaq reported that it was said: That person would be Khadir (Allah be pleased with him).
2938.02 | This hadith has been narrated by Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.
2938.03 | Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The Dajjal would come forth and a person from amongst the believers would go towards him and the armed men of the Dajjal would meet him and they would say to him: Where do you intend to go? He would say: I intend to go to this one who is coming forth. They would say to him: Don't you believe in our Lord? He would say: There is nothing hidden about our Lord. They would say: Kill him. Then some amongst them would say: Has your master (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without (his consent)? And so they would take him to the Dajjal and when the believer would see him, he would say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has informed (us). The Dajjal would then order for breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him and break his head. He would be struck even on his back and on his stomach. Then the Dajjal would ask him: Don't you believe in me? He would say: You are a false Masih. He would then order him to be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that the Dajjal would walk between the two pieces. He would then say to him: Stand, and he would stand erect. He would then say to him: Don't you believe in me? And the person would say: It has only added to my insight concerning you (that you are really the Dajjal). He would then say: O people, he would not behave with anyone amongst people (in such a manner) after me. The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him so that he should kill him (again). The space between his neck and collar bone would be turned into copper and he would find no means to kill him. So he would catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him (into the air) and the people would think as if he had been thrown in the Hell-Fire whereas he would be thrown in Paradise. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He would be the most eminent amongst persons in regard to martyrdom in the eye of the Lord of the world.
2939.01 | Mughira b. Shu'ba reported:No one asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) more about Dajjil than I asked him. He said: He should not be a source of worry to you for he would not be able to do any harm to you. I said: Allah's Messenger, it is alleged that he would have along with him (abundance of) food and water. Thereupon he said: He would be very insignificant in the eye of Allah (even) with all this.
2939.02 | Mughira b. Shu'ba reported that none asked Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) about Dajjal more than I asked him. I (one of the narrators other than Mughira b. Shu'ba) said:What did you ask? Mughira replied: I said that the people alleged that he would have a mountain load of bread and mutton and rivers of water. Thereupon he said: He would be more insignificant in the eye of Allah compared with all this.
2939.03 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Isma'il through other chains of transmitters with a slight variation of wording.
2940.01 | 'Abdullah b. 'Amr reported that a person came to him and said:What is this hadith that you narrate that the Last Hour would come at such and such time? Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, there is no god but Allah (or the words to the same effect). I have decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now. I had only said that you would see after some time an important event that the (sacred) House (Ka'ba) would be burnt and it would happen and definitely happen. He then reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty - I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble 'Urwa b Mas'ud. He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no rancour between two persons. Then Allah would send cold wind from the side of Syria that none would survive upon the earth having a speck of good in him or faith in him but he would die, so much so that even if some amongst you were to enter the innermost part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and that would cause his death. I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Only the wicked people would survive and they would be as careless as birds with the characteristics of beasts. They would never appreciate the good nor condemn evil. Then Satan would come to them in human form and would say: Don't you respond? And they would say: What do you order us? And he would command them to worship the idols but, in spite of this, they would have abundance of sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet would be blown and no one would hear that but he would bend his neck to one side and raise it from the other side and the first one to hear that trumpet would be the person who would be busy in setting right the tank meant for providing water to the camels. He would swoon and the other people would also swoon, then Allah would send or He would cause to send rain which would be like dew and there would grow out of it the bodies of the people. Then the second trumpet would be blown and they would stand up and begin to look (around). Then it would be said: O people, go to your Lord, and make them stand there. And they would be questioned. Then it would be said: Bring out a group (out of them) for the Hell-Fire. And then it would be asked: How much? It would be said: Nine hundred and ninty-nine out of one thousand for the Hell-Fire and that would be the day which would make the children old because of its terror and that would be the day about which it has been said: "On the day when the shank would be uncovered" (lxviii. 42).
2940.02 | Ya'qub b. 'Asim b. Urwa b. Mas'ud reported:I heard a person saying to 'Abdullah b. Amr: You say that the Last Hour would come at such and such time, whereupon he said: I had made up my mind that I would not narrate anything to you. I only said: But you would soon see after some time a very significant affair, for example the burning of the House (Ka'ba). Shu'ba said like this and 'Abdullah b Amr reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah. And in another hadith (the words are): None would survive who would have even a speck of faith in his heart, but he would be dead. Muhammad b. Ja'far reported that Shu'ba narrated to him this hadith many a time and I also read it out to him many a time.
2941.01 | `Abdullah b. `Amr reported:I committed to memory a hadith from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I did not forget it after I had heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: The first sign (out of the signs of the appearance of the Dajjal) would be the appearance of the sun from the west, the appearance of the beast before the people in the forenoon and which of the two happens first, the second one would follow immediately after that.
2941.02 | Abu Zur'a reported that three persons amongst Muslims had been sitting in Medina in the presence of Marwan b. Hakam and they heard him narrate these signs from him and the first amongst them was the appearance of the Dajjal. 'Abdullah b. 'Amr reported that Marwin said nothing (particular in this connection). I, however, heard a hadith from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I did not forget that after I had heard that from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he reported a hadith like the foregoing.
2941.03 | Abu Zur'a reported that there was a discussion in the presence of Marwan about the Last Hour, and Abdullah b. 'Amr said:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying. The rest of the hadith is the same, but there is no mention of forenoon.
2942.01 | Amir b. Sharahil Sha'bi Sha'b Hamdan reported that he asked Fatima, daughter of Qais and sister of ad-Dahhak b. Qais and she was the first amongst the emigrant women:Narrate to me a hadith which you had heard directly from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and there is no extra link in between them. She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting) on the side of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When I became a widow, 'Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), sent me the proposal of marriage. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama b. Zaid. And it had been conveyed to me that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usama. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may marry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Ansar. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently visited by guests and I do not like that your head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to which Fatima) belonged. So I shifted to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque (where) congregational prayer (is observed). So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was telling, you about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We said: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not. We said: yes. Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyya? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar. They said: Which aspect of it you want to know? He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the help of it, He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done? We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with them? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Has it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? 'The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranean) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary, he is in the east, he is in the east, he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east. I (Fatima bint Qais) said: I preserved it in my mind (this narration from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
2942.02 | Al-Sha'bi reported:We visited Fatima b. Qais and she served us fresh dates which are called rutab and she also served us barley. I asked her about that woman in whose case three divorces had been pronounced as to how much time she should count as the waiting period. She said: My husband pronounced three divorces in my case and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) permitted me to spend any waiting period in my family. (It was during this period) that announcement was made for the people to observe prayer in the bigger Mosque. I went there along with people and I was in the front row meant for women and it was adjacent to the last row of men and I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) deliver sermon sitting on the pulpit. He said: The cousin of Tamim (Dari) sailed in the ocean. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this addition:" (I see) as if I am looking to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) pointing his rod towards the land (and saying): It is Taiba, i. e. Medina."
2942.03 | Tamim Dari came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that he sailed in an ocean and his ship lost direction and thus landed at an island. They moved about in that land in search of water. There they saw a person who had been pulling his hair. The rest of the hadith is the same. And he (Dajjal) said:If I were to be permitted to set out I would have covered all the lands except Taiba. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) brought (Tamim Dari) before the public and he narrated to them and said: That is Taiba and that is the Dajjal.
2942.04 | Fatima b. Qais reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sat on the pulpit and said:O people, Tamim Dari has reported to me that some persons of his tribe sailed in the ocean in a boat and it capsised and then some of them travelled on one of the planks of the boat and they went to an island in the ocean. The rest of the hadith is the same.
2943.01 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:There will be no land which would not be covered by the Dajjal but Mecca and Medina, and there would no passage out of the passages leading to them which would not be guarded by angels arranged in rows. Then he (the Dajjal) would appear in a barren place adjacent to Medina and it would rock three times that every unbeliever and hypocrite would get out of it towards him.
2943.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Anas that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said this but with this addition that (the Dajjal would come) and pitch his tent in the waste-land of Juruf and thus there would come out of (the city) every hypocrite, man and woman.

2945.01 | Umm Sharik reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: The people would run away from the Dajjal seeking shelter in the mountains. She said: Where would be the Arabs then in that day? He said: They would be small in number.

2946.01 | Abu Qatada reported:We used to go to Imran b. Husain passing in front of Hisham b. 'Amir. He, one day, said: You pass by me (in order) to go to some persons, but (amongst the living persons) none remained in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) more than I and none knows more ahadith than I. I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: There would be no creation (creating more trouble) than the Dajjal right from the creation of Adam to the Last Hour.
2946.02 | This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of 'Imran b. Husain with a slight variation of wording.

2950 | This hadith has been reported by Sahl b. Sa'd that he heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:I and the Last Hour are (close to each other) like this (and he, in order to explain it) pointed (by joining his) forefinger, (one) next to the thumb and the middle finger (together).
2951.01 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) said:I and the Last Hour have been sent like this. Shu'ba said: I heard Qatada as saying in his narration: The excellence of one over the other. And I do not know whether he narrated it from Anas or Qatada himself said so.
2951.02 | Shu'ba reported:I heard Qatada and Abu Tayyab narrating that both of them heard Anas as narrating that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I and the Last Hour have been sent like this, and Shu'ba drew his forefinger and middle finger near each other while narrating it.

2952 | 'A'isha reported that when the desert Arabs came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) they asked about the Last Hour as to when that would come. And he looked towards the youngest amongst them and said:If he lives he would not grow very old that he would find your Last Hour coming to you (he would see you dying).
2953.01 | Anas reported that a person asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as to when the Last Hour would come. He had in his presence a young boy of the Ansar who was called Muhammad. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:If this young boy lives, he may not grow very old till (he would see) the Last Hour coming to you.
2953.02 | Anas b. Malik reported that a person asked Allah's Apostle (ﷺ):When would the Last Hour come? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) kept quiet for a while. Then looked at a young boy in his presence belonging to the tribe of Azd Shanu'a and he said: If this boy lives he would not grow very old till the Last Hour would come to you. Anas said that this young boy was of our age during those days.
2953.03 | Anas reported:A young boy of Mughira b. Shu'ba happened to pass by (the Holy Prophet) and he was of my age. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: If he lives long he would not grow very old till the Last Hour would come (to the old people of this generation).
2954 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The Last Hour would come (so sudden) that a person would be milking the she- camel and the (milk) would not reach the brim of the vessel that the Last Hour would come, and the two persons would be engaged in buying and selling of the clothes and their bargain would not be struck before the Last Hour would come. And someone would be setting his tank in order and he would have hardly set it right when the Last Hour would come.
2955.01 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Between the two blowings of the trumpet (there would be an interval of forty). They said: Abu Huraira, do you mean forty days? He said: I cannot say anything. They said: Do you mean forty months? He said: I cannot say anything. They said: Do you mean forty years? He said: I cannot say anything. Then Allah would cause the water to, descend from the sky and they (people) will sprout like vegetable. The only thing in a man which would not decay would be one bone (the tailbone) from which the whole frame would be reconstituted on the Day of Resurrection.
2955.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:The earth would consume all of the son of Adam except his tailbone. From it he was created, and from it he will be recreated (on the Day of Resurrection).

They said: We do not like to have it even for less than that as it is of no use to us. He said: Do you wish to have it (free of any cost)? They said: By Allah, even if it were alive (we would not have liked to possess that), for there is defect in it as its ear is very short; now it is dead also. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: By Allah, this world is more insignificant in the eye of Allah than it (this dead lamb) is in your eye.

Al-Jarrah to Bahrain for collecting Jizya and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had made a truce with the people of Bahrain and had appointed `Ala' b. Hadrami and Abu `Ubaida (for this purpose). They came with wealth from Bahrain and the Ansar heard about the arrival of Abu `Ubaida and they had observed the dawn prayer along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished the prayer, they (the Ansar) came before him and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled as he saw them and then said:I think you have heard about the arrival of Abu `Ubaida with goods from Bahrain. They said: Allah's Messenger, yes, it is so. Thereupon he said: Be happy and be hopeful of that which gives you delight. By Allah, it is not the poverty about which I fear in regard to you but I am afraid in your case that (the worldly) riches way be given to you as were given to those who had gone before you and you begin to vie with one another for them as they vied for them, and these may destroy you as these destroyed them.

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Nothing else besides it? You would (in fact) vie with one another, then you would feel jealous, then your relations would be estranged and then you will bear enmity against one another, or something to the same effect. Then you would go to the poor emigrants and would make some the masters of the others.
2963.01 | Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:When one of you looks at one who stands at a higher level than you in regard to wealth and physical structure he should also see one who stands at a lower level than you in regard to these things (in which he stands) at a higher level (as compared to him).
2963.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira through another chain of transmitters.
2963.03 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:Look at those who stand at a lower level than you but don't look at those who stand at a higher level than you, for that is better-suited that you do not disparage Allah's favors.

2964 | Abu Huraira, narrated that he heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:There were three persons in Bani Isra'il, one suffering from leprosy, the other bald-headed and the third one blind. Allah decided to test them. So He sent an angel who came to the one who was suffering from leprosy and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful colour and fine skin and removal of that which makes me detestable in the eye of people. He wiped him and his illness was no more and he was conferred upon beautiful colour and beautiful skin. He (the angel) again said: Which property do you like most? He said: Camels, or he said: The cow the narrator is, however, doubtful about it, but (out of the persons) suffering from leprosy or baldness one of them definitely said: The camel. And the other one said: Cow. And he (one who demanded camel) was bestowed upon a she-camel, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and while giving he said: May Allah bless you in this. Then he came to the bald-headed person and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful hair and that (this baldness) may be removed from me because of which people hate me. He wiped his body and his illness was removed and he was bestowed upon beautiful hair, and the angel said: Which wealth do you like most? He said: The cow. And he was given a pregnant cow and while handing it over to him he (the angel) said: May Allah bless you in this. Then he came to the blind man and he said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Allah should restore my eyesight so that I should be able to see people with the help of that. He wiped his body and Allah restored to him his eyesight, and he (the angel) also said: Which wealth do you like most? He said: The flock of sheep. And he was given a pregnant goat and that gave birth to young ones and it so happened that one valley abounded in camels and the other one in cows and the third one in sheep. He then came to the one who had suffered from leprosy in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a poor person and my provision has run short in my journey and there is none to take me to my destination except with the help of Allah and your favour. I beg of you in His name Who gave you fine colour and fine skin, and the camel in the shape of wealth (to confer upon me) a camel which should carry me in my journey. He said: I have many responsibilities to discharge. Thereupon he said: I perceive as if I recognise you. Were you not suffering from leprosy whom people hated and you were a destitute and Allah conferred upon you (wealth)? He said: I have inherited this property from my forefathers. Thereupon he said: If you are a liar may Allah change you to that very position in which you had been. He then came to the one who was bald-headed in his (old) form and said to him the same what he had said to him (one suffering from leprosy) and he gave him the same reply as he had given him and he said: If you are a liar, may Allah turn you to your previous position in which you had been. And then he came to the blind man in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a destitute person and a wayfarer. My provision have ran short and today there is no way to reach the destination but with the help of Allah and then with your help and I beg of you in the (name) of One Who restored your eyesight and gave you the flock of sheep to give me a sheep by which I should be able to make my provisions for the journey. He said: I was blind and Allah restored to me my eyesight; you take whatever you like and leave whatever you like. By Allah, I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the name of God. Thereupon, he said: You keep with you what you have (in your possession). The fact is that you three were put to test and Allah is well pleased with you and He is annoyed with your companions.
2965 | It is reported on the authority of Amir b. Sa'd that Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas was in the fold of his camels that his son 'Umar came to him. When Sa'd saw him he said:I seek refuge with Allah from the mischief of this rider. And as he got down he said to him: You are busy with your camels and your sheep and you have abandoned people who are contending with one another for kingdom. Sa'd struck his chest and said: Keep quite. I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Allah loves the servant who is God-conscious and is free from want and is hidden (from the view of people).
2966.01 | Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas is reported to have, said:By Allah, I am the first person amongst the Arabs to throw an arrow in the cause of Allah and we used to go with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and there was no food for us to eat but only the leaves of hubla and samur trees (they are wild trees) and as a result thereof one amongst us would relieve himself as does the goat. (How strange it is) that now the people of Banu Asad (the progeny of Zubair) instruct me in religion and try to impose punishment upon me (in regard to it). If it is so (that I am so ignorant of religion), then indeed, I am undone and my deeds have been lost. Ibn Numair, however, did not make a mention of the word (idhan) thus? (in his narration).
2966.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Isma'il b. Khalid with the same chain of transmitters and the words are:" One amongst us would relieve himself as the goats do without anything mixing with its excrement."
2967.01 | 'Umair al-'Adawi reported:'Utba b. Ghazwan delivered us a sermon and he praised Allah and lauded Him, then said: Now coming to the point, verily the world has been given the news of its end and that too quite early. Nothing would be left out of it but only water left in the utensil which its owner leaves, and you are going to shift to an abode which knows no end, and you should shift with the good before you, for we have been told that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would go down even for seventy years but would not be able to reach its bottom. By Allah, it would be fully packed. Do you find it something strange, and it has been mentioned that there yawns a distance which one would be able to cover in forty years from one end to another of Paradise, and a day would come when it would be fully packed and you must be knowing that I was the seventh amongst seven who had been with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the corners of the mouth were injured. We found a sheet which we tore in two and divided between myself and Sa'd b. Malik. I made the lower garment with halt of it and so did Sa'd make the lower garment with half of it and today there is none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city from amongst the cities (of the Islamic Commonwealth) and I seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great whereas I am insignificant in the eye of Allah. Prophethood does not remain for ever and its impact fades with the result that it changes eventually into kingship, and you would soon come to know and experience those rulers who would come after us and see (how far they are from religion).
2967.02 | Khalid b. 'Umair reported and he had seen the pre-Islamic days also, that 'Uqba b. Ghazwan delivered this address and he was the governor of Basra. The rest of the hadith is the same as transmitted by Shaiban.
2967.03 | Khalid b. Umair reported:I heard Uqba b. Ghazwan as saving: I found myself as the seventh amongst the seven who had been along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). We had nothing to eat but the leaves of hubla (a wild tree) until the corners of our mouths were injured.
2968 | Abu Huraira reported that they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said:Allah's Messenger, will we be able to see our Lord on the Day of Judgment? He said: Do you feel any difficulty in seeing the sun in the noon when there is no cloud over it? They said: No. He again said: Do you feel any difficulty in seeing the moon on the fourteenth night when there is no cloud over it? They said: No. Thereupon he said: By Allah Who is One in Whose Hand is my life. you will not face any difficulty in seeing your Lord but only so much as you feel in seeing one of them. Then Allah would sit in judgment upon the servant and would say: O, so and so, did I not honour you and make you the chief and provide you the spouse and subdue for you horses, camels, and afforded you an opportunity to rule over your subjects? He would say: Yes. And then it would be said: Did you not think that you would meet Us? And he would say: No. Thereupon He (Allah) would say: Well, We forget you as you forgot Us. Then the second person would be brought for judgment. (And Allah would) say: 0, so and so. did We not honour you and make you the chief and make you pair and subdue for you horses and camels and afford you an opportunity to rule over your subjects? He would say: Yes, my Lord. And He (the Lord) would say: Did you not think that you would be meeting Us? And he would say: No. And then He (Allah) would say: Well, I forget you today as you forgot Us. Then the third -one would be brought and He (Allah) would say to him as He said before. And he (the third person) would say: O, my Lord, I affirmed my faith in Thee and in Thy Book and in Thy Messenger and I observed prayer and fasts and gave charity, and he would speak in good terms like this as he would be able to do. And He (Allah) would say: Well, We will bring our witnesses to you. And the man would think in his mind who would bear witness upon him and then his mouth would be sealed and it would be said to his thighs, to his flesh and to his bones to speak and his thighs. flesh and bones would bear witness to his deeds and it would be done so that he should not be able to make any excuse for himself and he would be a hypocrite and Allah would be annoyed with him.
2969 | Anas b. Malik reported:We were in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when he smiled, and said: Do you know why I laughed? We said: Allah and His Messenger, know best. Thereupon he said: It was because (there came to my mind the) talk which the servant would have with his Lord (on the Day of judgment). He would say: My Lord, have you not guaranteed me protection against injustice? He would say: Yes. Then the servant would say: I do not deem valid any witness against me but my own self, and He would say: Well, enough would be the witness of your self against you and that of the two angels who had been appointed to record your deeds. Then the seal would be set upon his mouth and it would be said to his hands and feet to speak and they would speak of his deeds. Then the mouth would be made free to talk, he would say (to the hands and feet): Be away, let there be curse of Allah upon you. It was for your safety that I contended.
1055.02 | Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:O Allah, make for the family of Muhammad the provision which is a bare subsistence.

2972.01 | 'A'isha reported:We the family of Muhammad (ﷺ) used to spend (the whole) month in which we (did not need to) kindle the fire as (we had nothing to cook) ; we had only dates and water (to fill our bellies).
2972.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Urwa with the same chain of transmitters (and the words are):" We used to spend-" And he did not make a mention of the family of Muhammad (ﷺ), and Abu Kuraib made this addition to his hadith which was transmitted on the authority of Ibn Numair (and the words are):" But this that there was brought to us some meat."
2973 | `A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) died (in such a state) that there had been nothing in my wooden tub which a living being could afford to eat but a handful of barley. I had been eating out of that for a fairly long duration when I thought of measuring it and it was almost finished.
2972.03 | 'A'isha used to say to 'Urwa:Son of my sister, by Allah, I used to see the new moon, then the new moon, then the new moon, i. e. three moons in two months, and fire was not kindled in the house of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I ('Urwa) said: Auntie, then what were your means of sustenance? She said: Dates and water. But it (so happened) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had some Ansar as his neighbours and they had milch animals and they used to send to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) some milk of their (animals) and he served that to us.
2974 | 'Urwa b. Zubair reported on the authority of 'A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), that she said:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) died (in a state) that it never happened that he could eat to his fill the bread with olive oil twice during a day.
2975.01 | 'A'isha reported this hadith through other chains of transmitters also (and the words are) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) died (in a state) when the people could afford to eat only the dates and water.
2975.02 | 'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had died in a state that they could afford to eat two things only:water and dates.

2976.01 | Abu Huraira reported:By Him in Whose Hand is my life and Ibn 'Abbad also said: By One in Whose hand is the life of Abu Huraira, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) could not afford to provide adequate food to his family which could (fill their bellies) with bread and wheat for three days successively until he left the world.
2976.02 | Abu Hazim reported:I saw Abu Huraira point with his finger many a time and saying: By One in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Huraira, Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) could not eat to his fill and provide his family bread of wheat beyond three days successively until he left the world.
2977.01 | Nu'man b. Bashir said:Don't you eat and drink according to your heart's desire, whereas I saw that your Prophet (ﷺ) (at times) could not find even an inferior quality of the dates with which he could fill his belly? Qutaiba, however, did not make a mention of It.
2977.02 | This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Simak with the same chain of transmitters, with this addition of words:" You are not satisfied with the qualities of dates and butter."
2978 | Simak b. Barb reported:I heard Nu'man deliver an address in which he said that (Hadrat) Umar made a mention of what had fallen to the lot of people out of the material world and he said: I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) spend the whole day being upset because of hunger and he could not get even an interior quality of dates with which he could fill his belly.
2979.01 | 'Abd al-Rahman al-Hubuli reported:I heard that a person asked 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. 'As and heard him saying: Are we not amongst the destitute of the emigrants? Abdullah said to him: Have you a spouse with whom you live? He said: Yes. Abdullah asked: Do you not have a home in which you reside? The man replied "Yes." Abdullah said: Then you are amongst the rich. He said: I have a servant also. Thereupon he (Abdullah b. 'Amr b. 'As) said: Then you are amongst the kings. Abu 'Abd al-Rahman reported that three persons came to 'Abdullah b. Amr b. 'As while I was sitting with him and they said: By Allah, we have nothing with us either in the form of provision, riding animals or wealth. Thereupon he said to them: I am prepared to do whatever you like. If you come to us, we would give you what Allah would make available for you. and if you like I would make a mention of your case to the ruler, and if you like you can show patience also. for I have heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: The destitute amongst the emigrants would precede the rich emigrants by forty years in getting into Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. Thereupon they said: We then, show patience and do not ask for anything.
2980.01 | 'Abdullah b. Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said in connection with the people of Hijr (Thamud):Do not enter but weepingly (the habitations) of these people who had been punished by (Allah), and in case you do not feel inclined to weep, then do not enter (these habitations) that you may not meet the same calamity as had fallen to their lot.
2980.02 | Ibn Shihab reported, and he had been talking about the stony abodes of Thamud, and he said:Salim b. 'Abdullah reported that 'Abdullah b. Umar said: We were passing along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) through the habitations of Hijr, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Do not enter but weepingly the habitations of these persons who committed tyranny among themselves, lest the same calamity should fall upon you as it fell upon them.

(After that the clouds slinked aside and poured water on a stony ground. It filled a channel amongst the channels of that land and that person followed that water and he found a person standing in the garden busy in changing the course of water with the help of a hatchet. He said to him: Servant of Allah, what is your name? he said: So and so. And it was that very name which he had heard from the clouds. and he said to him: Servant of Allah, why do you ask me my name? He said: I heard a voice from the clouds of which is the downpour, saying: Water the garden of so and so, like your name. What do you do (for the favour) shown to you by Allah in this matter? He said: Now as you state so. I look what yield I get from it, and I give one-third as charity out of it and I and my children eat one-third of it and one-third I return to it as investment.

By Allah.

The denizens of Hell would gather round him and say: O, so and so, what has happened to you? Were you not enjoining us to do what was reputable and forbid us to do what was disreputable? He will say: Of course, it is so; I used to enjoin (upon people) to do what was reputable but did not practise that myself.

And (it means) that a servant should do a deed during the night and tell the people in the morning that he has done so and so, whereas Allah has concealed it.

I came back to my mother and informed her about it, and when he came to her she said: My son sneezed in your presence and you did not say:" Allah may have mercy upon you, and she sneezed and you said for her:" May Allah have mercy upon you." Thereupon he said: Your son sneezed but he did not praise Allah and I did not beg mercy of Allah for him and she sneezed and she praised Allah and so I said: May Allah have mercy upon you, as I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: When any one of you sneezes he should praise Allah and the other should say: May Allah have mercy upon you, and if he does not praise Allah, no mercy should be begged for him.
2993 | Iyas b. Salama b. al-Akwa reported that his father reported to him that he heard Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying:A person sneezed in his presence and he said to him: May Allah have mercy upon you.

I do not know what happened to it, but I think (that it 'underwent a process of metamorphosis) and assumed the shape of rats. Don't you see when the milk of the camel is placed before them, these do not drink and when the milk of goat is placed before them, these do drink. Abu Huraira said: I narrated this very hadith to Ka'b and he said: Did you hear this from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? I (Abu Huraira) said: Yes. He said this again and again, and I said: Have I read Torah? This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Ishaq with a slight variation of wording.
2997.02 | Abu Huraira reported that the rat (is the result of) metamorphosis (of a group of Bani Isra'il) and the proof of this is that when the milk of goat is placed before it, it drinks it, and when the milk of the camel is placed before it, it would not taste it at all. Ka'b said:Did you hear it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? Thereupon he said: Has Torah been revealed to me?

Abu Bakra reported on the authority of his father that a person praised another person in the presence of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), whereupon he said:Woe be to thee, you have broken the neck of your friend, you have broken the neck of your friend-he said this twice. If one of you has to praise his friend at all, he should say: I think (him to be) so and Allah knows it well and I do not know the secret of the heart and Allah knows the destined end, and I cannot testify his purity against Allah but (he appears) to be so and so.

Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: If anyone has to praise his brother at all, he should say: I think him to be so and so, and even on this he should say: I do not consider anyone purer than Allah (considers).

Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:It was shown in a vision that I was rinsing my mouth with miswak and two persons began to contend with one another for getting that miswak. One was older than the other. I gave the miswak to the younger one amongst them, but it was said to me: (Let it be given) to the older one. So I gave it to the older one.
2493.02 | It was reported that Abu Huraira used to say:Listen to me, inmate of the apartment; listen to me, inmate of the apartment, while 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) had been busy in observing prayer. As she finished prayer, she said to" Urwa: Did you hear his words? And this is how Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to utter (so distinctly) that if one intended to count (the words uttered) he would be able to do so.
3004 | Abu Sa'id Khudri reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Do not take down anything from me, and he who took down anything from me except the Qur'an, he should efface that and narrate from me, for there is no harm in it and he who attributed any falsehood to me-and Hammam said: I think he also said:" deliberately" -he should in fact find his abode in the Hell-Fire.
3005 | Suhaib reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) thus said:There lived a king before you and he had a (court) magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: I have grown old, send some young boy to me so that I should teach him magic. He (the king) sent to him a young man so that he should train him (in magic). And on his way (to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there. He (the young man) listened to his (the monk's) talk and was impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk and set there and he came to the magician (late). He (the magician) beat him because of delay. He made a complaint of that to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family had detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician had detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people, and he (the young boy) said: I will come to know today whether the magician is superior or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about (on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial don't give my clue. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you. He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) for a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. And he 'said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest and the mountain began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water). So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people in an open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his quiver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually done what you aimed at averting. They (the people) have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He (the king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who would not turn back from his (boy's) religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. (The people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire and the child said to her: 0 mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.
3006 | 'Ubadah b. Walid b. Samit reported:I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Ma'afiri upon him. And his servant too had a Ma'afiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mother's bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (Abu'I-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Ma'afir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him. He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allah's Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques. It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. 'Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allah's Messenger, it' is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Don't curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded. It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allah's Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allah's Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allah's Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that. Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allah's Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word" faitab'd" and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Isma'il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allah's Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allah's Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah's Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skin's,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (ﷺ) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our heart's content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.
2009.03 | Al-Bara' b. 'Azib reported that Abu Bakr Siddiq came to the residence of my father ('Azib) and bought a haudaj from him and said to 'Azib:Send your son to my residence (to carry this haudaj), and my father said to me: Carry it (for him). So I carried it and there went along with him (with Abu Bakr) my father in order to fetch its price and he ('Azib) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr, narrate to me what you both did on the night when you set out on a journey along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, and the path was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got down at that place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the place where the Prophet (ﷺ) would take rest under its shade. I then set the bedding and said: Allah's Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep a watch around you. I went out and watched around him. There we saw a shepherd moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we intended (i. e. taking rest). I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He said: I am a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats? He said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it should be free from hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara' striking his hand upon the other (to give an indication) how he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup which he had with him and I had with me a bucket in which I kept water for drinking and for performing ablution. I came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and did not like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled from the sleep. I poured water upon the milk (till It was cold) and I said: Allah's Messenger, take this milk. He then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian and Suraqa b. Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said: Allah's Messenger, we are about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he also said: I know you have hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I shall turn everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah's Messenger) supplicated Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he said: I have combed all this side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in fact fulfilled his promise.
2009.04 | Al-Bara' reported:Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman b. 'Umar, the words are: He (Suraqa b. Malik) drew near Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and he (the Holy Prophet) cursed him and his camel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully aware of It that it is your doing. Supplicate Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitchforked) and I give you a solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are coming after me. Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I don't need your camels. And we (the Prophet and Abu Bakr) came to Medina during the night and the people began to contend as to where Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) should reside and he encamped in the tribe of Najjar who were related to 'Abd ul-Muttalib from the side of mother. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) honoured them, then people climbed upon house-top and women also and boys scattered in the way, and they were all crying: Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, Messenger of Allah.
3015 | Hammim b. Munabbih reported:This is what Abu Huraira reported to us from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and in this connection he narrated some of the ahadith and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: It was said to people of Israel: Enter this land saying Hitta (Remove Thou from us the burden of our sins), whereupon We would forgive you your sins, but they twisted (this statement) and entered the gate dragging upon their breech and said: The" grain in the ear."
3016 | Anas b. Malik reported that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, sent revelation to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) just before his death in quick succession until he left for his heavenly home, and the day when he died, he received the revelation profusely.
3017.01 | Tariq b. Shihab reported that a Jew said to'Umar:You recite a verse which, if it had been revealed in relation to us, we would have taken that day as the day of rejoicing. Thereupon 'Umar said: I know where it was revealed and on the day when it was revealed and where Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been at that time when it was revealed. It was revealed on the day of 'Arafa (ninth of Dhu'l Hijjah) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been staying in 'Arafat. Sufyan said: I doubt, whether it was Friday or not (and the verse referred to) is this:" Today I have perfected your religion for you and completed My favours upon you" (v. 4).
3017.02 | Tariq b. Shihab reported that a Jew said to 'Umar:If this verse were revealed in relation to the Jews (i e. "This day I have perfected your religion for you and have completed My favours for you and have chosen for you al-Islam as religion") we would have taken the day of rejoicing on which this verse was revealed. Thereupon 'Umar said: I know the day on which it was revealed and the hour when it was revealed and where Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been when it was revealed. It was revealed on the night of Friday and we were in 'Arafat with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at that time.
3017.03 | Tariq b. Shihab reported that a Jew came to 'Umar and said:Commander of the Faithful, there is a verse in your Book, which you recite. Had it been revealed in connection with the Jews, we would have taken it as the day of rejoicing. Thereupon he said: Which verse do you mean? He replied:" This day I have perfected your religion for you and I have completed My favours upon you and I have chosen al-Islam as religion for you." Umar said, I know the day when it was revealed and the place where it was revealed. It was revealed to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at 'Arafat on Friday.
3018.01 | 'Urwa b. Zubair reported that he asked 'A'isha about the words of Allah:" If you fear that you will not be able to maintain equity amongst the orphan girls, then marry (those) you like from amongst the women two, three or four." She said: O, the son of my sister, the orphan girl is one who is under the patronage of her guardian and she shares with him in his property and her property and beauty fascinate him and her guardian makes up his mind to marry her without giving her due share of the wedding money and is not prepared (to pay so much amount) which anyone else is prepared to pay and so Allah has forbidden to marry these girls but in case when equity is observed as regards the wedding money and they are prepared to pay them the full amount of the wedding money and Allah commanded to marry other women besides them according to the liking of their heart. 'Urwa reported that 'A'isha said that people began to seek verdict from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after the revelation of this verse about them (orphan girls) and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" They asked thee verdict about women; say: Allah gives verdict to you in regard to them and what is recited to you in the Book about orphan woman, whom you give not what is ordained for them while you like to marry them" (iv. 126). She said: The wording of Allah" what is recited to you" in the Book means the first verse, i. e." if you fear that you may not be able to observe equity in case of an orphan woman, marry what you like in case of woman" (iv. 3). 'A'isha said: (And as for this verse [iv. 126], i. e. and you intend" to marry one of them from amongst the orphan girls" it pertains to one who is in charge (of orphans) having small amount of wealth and less beauty and they have been forbidden that they should marry what they like of her wealth and beauty out of the orphan girls, but with equity, because of their disliking for them.
3018.02 | 'Urwa reported that he asked 'A'isha about the words of Allah:" If you fear that you will not be able to observe equity in case of orphan girls" ; the rest of the hadith is the same but with a slight variation of wording.
3018.03 | 'A'isha said that as for the words of Allah:" If you fear that you would not be able to observe equity in case of orphan girls)," it was revealed in reference to a person who had an orphan girl (as his ward) and he was her guardian, and her heir, and she possessed property, but there was none to contend on her behalf except her ownself. And he (her guardian) did not give her in marriage because of her property and he tortured her and ill-treated her, it was in relation to her that (Allah said: )" If you fear that you would not be able to observe equity in case of orphan girls, then marry whom you like among women," i. e. whatever I have made lawful for you and leave her whom you are putting to torture.
3018.04 | 'A'isha said in connection with His words (those of Allah):" What is recited to you in the Book about orphan women whom you give not what is ordained for them, while you like to marry them," these were revealed in connection with an orphan girl who was in the charge of the person and she shared with him in his property and he was reluctant to marry her himself and was also unwilling to marry her to someone else (fearing) that (that person) would share in his property (as the husband of that girl), preventing her to marry, neither marrying her himself nor marrying her to another person.
3018.05 | Hisham reported that 'A'isha said in connection with the words of Allah:" They ask thee the religious verdict about women, say: Allah gives you the verdict about them" (iv. 126), that these relate to an orphan girl who is in charge of the person and she shares with him in his property (as a heir) even in the date-palm trees and he is reluctant to give her hand in marriage to any other person lest he (her husband) should partake of his property, and thus keep her in a lingering state.
