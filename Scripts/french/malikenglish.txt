But if this one will see the blood, her husband will have the right to coitus with her, because she will be considered as a woman who suffers a flow of blood”.

Once awake, Abdallah came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and told him his dream.

(150) 2 - Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "when you hear the call to prayer, repeat what the muezzin says”.

If they knew what is like merit by arriving early to pray in the mosque, they would have rush to get there. And if they knew what there is as merit in doing the evening prayer and that of the dawn in common, they would have returned, even dragging on all fours". 
(152) 4 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "when you hear the second call to prayer, do not hurry there, rather come in peace.

(153) 5 - Al-Mazini a reported from his father that Abu Sa'id Al Khoudri said to him: "I see that you love sheep and the desert.

After the first call is over, it comes back and stays until the time of the second call. When the second call was made, Satan goes away again and then comes back to place himself between the man and his heart, suggesting to him and saying: “Remember such a thing, remember such a thing, that this man never thought of, that in the end, he no longer remembers the number of raka'ts he already has carried out". 155) 7 - Sahl Ibn Sa'd As-Sa'idi said: “there are two times (lit. two hours) when the Gates heavens open and few people invoke Allah and let their prayers are answered: when we call to prayer and when we put ourselves in rank to fight in the way of Allah". Malek was asked at about the timing of the call to prayer, will Friday be before its appointed time. He answered: “no, its moment will be when the sun has left the meridian”. Malek was asked at about the two calls to prayer and when should people get up to pray? He answered: "I don't know about them other than what I saw the men do: on the second call we don't pick up not for twice the same words (what we do for the first) and this is what well-informed people constantly do in Medina. As to when people have to get up to pray after the second call, I do not find in this a definite time, but I see that we must take into consideration the capacity of the men, for among them there will be both the strong and the weak, and they cannot all be alike”. Malek was asked at about people all present to make the prescribed prayer, in common; so they wanted to make the second call without the first? He replied: "That is enough because the first appeal was imposed only in the mosques frequented by a multitude of people where we pray in common”. We asked again Malek on the muezzin's greeting to the imam and his invitation to preside over the prayer and of the first person to be greeted? He replied, "I was not informed that this bow was practiced at there first period”. Malek was asked at subject of a man who calls for prayer but no one is present to do it with him; then he makes the second call, and prays alone, after which people come to pray, will he have to redo prayer with them? He replied, "No, he won't have to do it again, and whoever comes after the prayer has ended, he may accomplish it alone”. Malek was asked at about a man who calls for prayer and then says a prayer supererogatory. People arriving at the mosque, wanted another make the second call can be made by another person". Malek has says, "We keep making the first call to the dawn prayer before the dawn appears. As for the other prayers, we do not make the first call only after their scheduled hours. 
(156) 8 - We told Malek that the muezzin came to find Omar Ibn Al-Khattab to warn him that it is time for the dawn prayer. finding it asleep, he said to her: “prayer is better than sleep. Omar subsequently ordered this to be pronounced in the first appeal to the dawn prayer. 
(157) 9 Souhail Ibn Malek reported from his father that he said, "What I saw the men (it is understood: the companions of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him grace and peace of Allah)) do (without changing it) this is the first call to prayer".

(161) 13 - Hicham Ibn Urwa reported that his father said to him: “When you are traveling, you can make the first and second calls to prayer, and you can settle for the second without the first". Malek said: "There's nothing wrong with a man doing the first call to prayer as he straddles his mount". 
(162) 14 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab said: “He who prays (alone) in a deserted place, an angel on his right and another on his left are praying with him. When he makes the first and the second call to prayer or the second, alone, a crowd of angels like the mountains pray behind him". Chapter III The time devoted to suhur expires with the first call to prayer

He acted thus, until he has met Allah”.

Malek, commenting on this, said: "When a man wants by this takbir to begin his pray". We asked to Malek, about a man who comes to pray in common behind the imam, forgetting to do the takbir at the beginning of the prayer, and at the bow, until he has performed a raka't, then remembering this, he pronounces the takbir during the second raka't”? He replied: "it is for me to preference that he do the takbir at the beginning of the prayer even if he forgets to do so following the imam and he does it during the first bow, because it is enough if he considers it as the takbir of the beginning”. About the one who prays alone, forgetting to pronounce the takbir at the beginning, Malek said, “he can continue his prayer”. And regarding, the imam who forgets the takbir from the beginning of the prayer, until he accomplishes it, Malek said: "I think he must resume prayer, as well as for those who prayed with him, even if the latter pronounced the takbir, they must remake".

D - Malek said, at about a man who, having ten dinars, then benefiting from this sum, in the field of commerce, to reach twenty dinars after the lapse of a year, he must submit this new sum to zakat without waiting for a year has elapsed from the day it was formed, because this period was elapsed when he possessed twenty dinars. Subsequent zakat is not payable until one year after the penultimate one has been paid. E - Malek added: “This what has been heard about the wages of slaves and their tribute, the wages of the poor, and the price of the release of the contractual slave, is that all these cases are not subject to zakat, and that whatever the amount, unless a year has already passed, precisely from day on which the beneficiary received the sum". F - And Malek says again: “for gold and silver which are in association, where each has a share of twenty dinars or two hundred dirhams, they owe zakat. Whoever has less than that is exempt from paying zakat. If all shares are subject to zakat, but with a variant, when the value of these shares is different from one share to another, so that some shares are lower than the sum where it is the duty to pay the zakat, as for the others, if the sum is higher, the zakat will be provided for in these last shares, also according to their values; because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "zakat is not obligatory for a sum of less than five ounces of silver". Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." - Malek said: “if a man has gold and silver, but they are scattered among people, he must assess them so that he pays on them, the due zakat”. - And from the saying of Malek: "Whoever, by inheritance or by gift, obtains gold and silver, the zakat on their subject, is only due, before the lapse of one year" . Chapter III Metal zakat. 
(582) 8 - Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdel-Rahman reported from many that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had granted Bilal Ibn Al-Hareth the privilege of a territory on the coast containing the mines of Qabaliya, on the side of "Four'" (Between Medina and Nakieh). These mines are still subject to zakat”. Malek said: "I think and Allah is best informed that these buried metals are only due for zakat, when what is of their extracts is equivalent to twenty dinars or two hundred dirhams; and whatever is in excess, shall likewise be subject to zakat according to the legal assessment of zakat; in case we are unable to extract what is valuable from these metals, nothing is subject to zakat, only when what is extracted is equivalent to twenty dinars in gold or two hundred dirhams in silver, taking into account the first evaluation”. And Malek said, “metal is to be compared to crops; both are subject to zakat; what is extracted from the first is subject to zakat, without the expectation of a year passing; as for harvests, the tenth of their quantities is for zakat, and that, before one year is exceeded. Chapter IV From the zakat of buried metals called: “Al - Rikaz” 
(583) 9 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “the rikaz is subject to the fifth”. (the buried treasure) Malek said: "which is unquestionably followed in Medina, and that, moreover, I have heard from the ulema is that: the rikaz is all that is buried from the pre-Islamic era; it is all one can have without price, expense, hard work, or supplies. On the other hand, what requires an effort, or an expense, and where one has the risk of finding or not by digging, it is not rikaz. Chapter V Of what is not subject to zakat such as jewelry, gold dust and amber. 
(584) 10 - Abdel-rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported from his father that Aicha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r Upon him the grace and peace of Allah took care of his orphan nieces, who lived under his guardianship, keeping their jewelry for them, without her paying zakat on them. 
(585) 11 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar, did not pay the zakat, on the objects of adornment, of his daughters and his slaves (females). Malek said: "Whoever has powdered gold or gold or silver jewelry that does not serve as adornment, must pay zakat about them, every year by taking a quarter of a tenth after weighing them, unless the value is not twenty dinars in gold or two hundred dirhams in silver, if, what he possesses is less than that , zakat is not payable. As for gold powder or broken jewelry which their owner intends to repair, then use it for adornment, they are held like furniture in a house and are not subject to zakat”. Malek also said: “neither pearls, nor musk, nor amber, are subject to zakat”. Chapter VI The subject of zakat with regard to the property of orphans, and the profit they bring in trade. 
(586) 12 • It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "Make the goods of the orphans are fructified in the trade, otherwise the zakat will eat them away”. 
(587) 13 - Abdel-Rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported from his father the following: “Aicha, looked after me and my brother, being two orphans, under her guardianship; she paid zakat, goods that we had”. 
(588) 14 • It was reported to Malek, that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) exposed to trade, the money that went to the orphans, being under his guardianship". 
(589) 15 - Malek reported that Yahia Ibn Sa'id bought for his orphan nephews, living under his guardianship, property, which was later sold, bringing in a great profit”. Malek said, “There is no harm in orphans' money being traded in case the protector is permitted to do so; I don't think that the protector should thereby provide a guarantee. Chapter VII Inheritances subject to zakat. 
(590) 16 - Malek said: "When a man dies and he has not paid zakat of his property, I find that zakat be taken from a third of his inheritance, taking into account that this should in no case be more than a third. It is even necessary that the zakat be deducted from it before terminating the will, because, in my opinion. This is considered in the form of debts which must be discharged”. Malek continuing: “this is the case of a man who has already made his will; if this is not the case, it is necessary that his people do it, because it will be a good way to act; moreover, they are not obliged to do so”. Malek also said: "What is undisputed tradition and good practice (in Medina) is that someone who inherits should not pay the zakat, for any property he receives from a loan repaid to the dead, from a transaction, from a dwelling, from a slave, from a slave before one year has passed, from the day he cashes in the sum that comes to him from the sale of this property”. On the other hand, what is our tradition, says Malek, is that the heir does not owe zakat for an estate until one year has passed”. Chapter VIII Zakat due on a debt. 
(591) 17 Al-Saib Ibn Yazid reported that Osman Ibn Affan said: “This is the month of paying your zakat. He who owes a debt, let him discharge it, and when you have recovered your rights, pay the zakat on them”. (592) 18- Ayoub Ibn Abi Tamima Al-Sakhtiane reported that Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz ordered, in writing, his prefects, who unjustly levied taxes, taxpayers, to return them by deducting from them the zakat due to the years already passed. Then he revised his opinion and prescribed that this zakat is to be collected for only one time because we no longer know, from whom these taxes had been collected, and whether or not he had to pay the zakat”. 
(593) 19 - Yazid Ibn Khoussaifa reported that he asked Suleiman Ibn Yassar at Subject of a man possessing and being indebted to the same amount of money; does he have to pay zakat for what he owns? He replied, "No". Malek said: "What is not to be discussed for the question of debts is that whoever lends does not pay zakat, only after having recovered his loan, even if the debtor owes this debt for many years; and in this case, the one who has the right, owes the zakat only once after having recovered the ready. In the event that he partially recovers the loan, this sum is not subject to zakat; but if he possesses a sum, other than the one he has just had, after recovery of his debt, this sum is subject to zakat, which will be relative and to the sum in question, and to the part of the loan which he had already recovered". Malek continued: “in case this man does not have his loan, and this is not due from a zakat, then, the zakat is not to pay; but that he remember well what he has already recovered, because when there will be an addition so that everything will be subject to zakat, he must pay it”. And Malek went on to say, “In case the sum recovered from the loan has been consumed or not, the zakat is obligatory with what he will have collected elsewhere, which with the first part is equivalent to twenty dinars in gold, or two hundred dirhams in silver. As for what he will recover later from the loan, whether little or much, the zakat in this case, will be payable relatively to the sum”. Malek resumed: “like proof of what we have just mentioned, about the debt, so that it has been recovered after a good number of years, as for the zakat, which is appropriate for it, it is payable only for one one time, - it is to be compared to a commodity, being and remaining with a merchant for several years; selling it, the merchant will only pay the zakat he owes his merchandise once. It's that the owner of the goods or the creditor no longer has to pay the zakat due on a property which, if applicable, belongs to a third person; zakat, in fact, is only required of property in material possession" Malek said finally says: “For the man who is burdened with a debt to be paid, and possesses its equivalence in merchandise, in addition to a sum of money subject to zakat; in this case the zakat is payable for the sum liquidated without taking into account what he must pay as debt, or what he possesses as merchandise; but once the sum in liquid exceeds that which he has for debt, he must pay the zakat due on this superfluity”. Chapter IX Goods subject to zakat. 
(594) 20 Zuraik Ibn Hayyan, in charge of controlling passengers entering Egypt, in the time of Al-Walid, Suleiman and Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz, reported that Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz ordered him in writing to observe passengers Moslems who enter, to take part of the money which they have, and of the value of their goods intended for the trade, by collecting on each sum of forty dinars, a dinar; to take into account what is less than that, until reaching the bottom of twenty dinars, and if it is still less than twenty, that is to say by a third, in this case, to perceive nothing”. As for the passengers who live under the Moslem protection, to perceive from them, a dinar out of twenty of the value of their goods which are for sale; to consider, which is less than that up to ten dinars; if it is less than ten dinars, to demand nothing, even if it is less than a third of the dinar, not to profit. To give them exchange, valid receipts, for one year, for what you perceive from them". A-Malek said: "what is practice in Medina, in the field of commerce, in case a man pays what he owes for zakat, then buys, with what he owns, a variety of merchandise; silk garments, slaves, or others and sells his purchases before a year is exceeded, this man owes nothing as zakat until one year later, from the day he paid the first zakat. On the other hand, if what he had bought remains at home, no sold, and this for several years, he will not have to pay the due zakat, even if it will last for a long time, until the sale takes place; at that time, zakat will be paid for one time only,'. B - For the subject who buys wheat, dates or other goods with gold or silver coins and keeps them to sell, but after a year has already passed, is zakat due for such goods? Malek replied: "Zakat is obligatory on the day of the sale, if the amount withheld of the sale is assessed to be subject to zakat; and that is not to be compared to the case of the harvest where the man obtains the output of his harvest, nor even to that of the cutting of the palm trees”. C - Malek said: “if the man owns money invests in the field of trade for a profit, and that is not the case, zakat is of obligation on this subject, and this by taking as point of reference a month of the year, where it will make a census by evaluating the available goods, and what it has as liquidated sum in gold or other; if the total amount is subject to zakat, it is payable”. D - Malek added: "those who practice, or not, trade, they are all the same, and only pay zakat once a year". Chapter X Of what is relative to the (buried) treasure. 
(595) 21 - Abdallah Ibn Dinar reported that he heard Abdallah Ibn Umar inquiring about the buried treasure? What is it? And response: “It is of all metals, which are not due for zakat”?. 
(596) 22 - Abu Saieh Al-Samman reported that Abu Huraira said: “Whoever has property, and does not pay for it what he owes for zakat, this property, on the day of resurrection, will take the form of a python, with a bald head, provided with two small horns, seeking the possessor of goods to capture him, saying to him: "I am your treasure". Chapter XI Of the zakat of the herds. 
(597) 23 - Yahia reported that Malek said: that he read the information prescribed by Omar Ibn Al-Khattab relating to zakat, and there he found: - For twenty-four camels, (24) or less, the zakat is one monton for every five camels. - For a number beyond twenty-four, (24) reaching thirty-five, (35) inclusive, the zakat is of a camel of one year old, otherwise, a camel of two years old. - For a number varying between thirty and five, (35) and forty and five, (45) a camel two years old. - For what is between forty and six, (46) up to sixty, (60) inclusive, a camel three years old and ready for copulation. Between sixty-one (61) and sixty-fifteen, (75) inclusive, a four-year-old female camel. - From seventy-six (76) to ninety-ten, (90) two camels of two years of age. - From eighty and eleven, (91) to one hundred and twenty, (120) two camels three years old and ready for copulation. - For all that is beyond one hundred and twenty-one, (121) a one-year-old camel for every forty (40) camels, and a three-year-old camel ready for copulation for every fifty (50). - As for the sheep: forty to a hundred and twenty (from 40 to 120) a sheep. - For between one hundred and twenty one (121) and two hundred, (200) the zakat is two sheep. - From two hundred and one (201) to three hundred, (300) three sheep. - From three hundred and one (301) and above that number, one sheep for every hundred. - On the other hand, we should not give alms, neither from a goat, nor from an old animal, nor from an animal which has lost a limb, unless the collector agrees to take it”. - One should not group two lots, nor separate a group of two lots because of the zakat. - In case there is a mixture of two lots, where they cannot be distinguished, both owners owe zakat. - With regard to money, the zakat is a quarter of a tenth if the weight is equal to or exceeds five ounces. Chapter XII Zakat from cows. 
(598) 24 - Taous Al-Yemeni reported that Mu'az Ibn Jabal Al-Ansari took from thirty cows, the zakat of a calf one year old, and forty cows, a cow three years old without collecting anything of what was less than that saying: “I have not heard anything from the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) On him the grace and the gaix of Allah as information about them, and I will ask him when I meet him”. But the envoy of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) died before Mu'az met him". A - Malek said: “What I have heard the best say about a man, owning a herd (of cows) which two or more shepherds, in different countries, had taken care of, that this man owes zakat for his reunited flock. His case is to be compared to one who possesses a sum of gold or silver, but to the holding of several persons; he must identify it and evaluate it so that he pays the zakat, if this sum is subject to it”. B - About the man owning a herd of sheep and goats, Malek said, “he has to bring them together to find out what zakat is due to them. due because this herd will be considered as made up of sheep alone, and this by referring to the letter of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab (mentioned above): "of forty sheep, one sheep". C - Malek added: “If the number of sheep is greater than that of goats, the owner of the herd owes only one sheep for the collector in charge of the zakat affair. If the goats are at a number exceeding that of the sheep, the collector takes a goat (or a goat). If the sheep and the goats are the same number, the collector will choose one as he pleases”. D - Yahia reported that Malek said: "it is the same case that arises, whether they are camels called: 'Arab', or camels with long necks called: “boukhts”. Malek said: “They are ultimately all camels; if the number of Arabs exceeds that of the boukht, and the owner owes only one more than that from Arabs, he can take a boukht; if the number is the same for the two categories, the collector takes one of the kind he chooses”. E - Malek said, "It's likewise, for the case of cows and buffaloes all put together; he said, “They are all cows. If the number of cows exceeds that of buffaloes, and the owner owes only one cow, the collector takes a cow, and if the buffaloes outnumber the cows, he takes a buffalo; if cows and buffaloes are equal in number, the collector will choose, one, of the kind he wants. Finally, if zakat is required from both genders, the collector takes one of each gender”. F - Yahia a reported that Malek said, "He who in his flock brought together camels, cows and sheep, owes no zakat until just one year has elapsed from the day on which this meeting took place. been made; unless he previously had a herd subject to zakat, consisting of five camels, or thirty cows, or forty sheep. If the man owned five camels, or thirty cows, or forty sheep, and he added to them camels, cows, sheep, which came to him either by purchase, or by gift, or by inheritance, he has to pay zakat on them when he pays her for what he had before the attached ones, even if a year had not yet passed, from the day he started to use their usufruct. In case zakat has been paid for animals that have been joined with others, he will pay zakat for them along with that of his herd. G - They are considered, and still according to Malek, as the money whose zakat was paid, then the man used this money to buy goods, while the zakat became of obligation, if he sells it; and in this case the former owner will have paid the zakat, the same day of the transaction, and the second owner the following day”. H - For the man who owned a herd of sheep not payable by zakat, to which he added other sheep, either by purchase or by inheritance, but the number of which does not call for zakat, this man don't have to pay zakat before a year is passed, just from the day when the purchase or the inheritance took place is that the man in possession of a herd of camels, sheep and cows, the number of which is not not yet sufficient, to pay zakat; it will be in case each kind (of sheep, cows, camels) reaches the number where zakat is indebted. This is what is to be considered for the payment of zakat, when one joins the herd in a small or large number of the existing genera”. 1 - And Malek has added: "For the man who owns camels, cows, or sheep where each gender makes zakat indebted, and then joins what it owns, others of the same kind, zakat is to be paid for what he has as a whole". Yahia reports that Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." J - Malek said: “For the animal, whose zakat is indebted: if it is a one-year-old camel and a man does not own it, he can give, in exchange, a two-year-old camel If it's a camel two years old, or one of three years old, or even four years old, and that the man does not have what he owes, it is better, that he buys it, than to give his price to the collector. K - As for, what we uses camels or cows, either to bring water or to plow the land, Malek said: "I think that of those you have to pay zakat". Chapter XIII From zakat of a herd to different kinds. 
(599) 25 - Yahia reported that Malek said, "If there is a mixture of two flocks, and one shepherd, and where there is one stallion, one pasture and one bucket, the owners of that mixed flock, are associates even if we can determine the share of each. On the other hand, if we does not know each other's share, they are not partners but co-owners". Malek said, "In case the owners are in common, zakat is payable only when the share of each is determined to be in this capacity. This is interpreted as follows: “Whoever owns forty sheep, he owes zakat; as for the other who has less, zakat is not obligatory. In the event that each share is indebted for one zakat, the two parts can be combined, to receive only one zakat. Take for example the following: If one has a thousand sheep or less, and the other forty or more, they are joint owners and each pays the zakat corresponding to his share; for the case of thousand and forty camels, their common owners will react such as those who own sheep and where each will pay the proper zakat for his share, if this is indebted for zakat; because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "The zakat is not to be paid for the number of camels less than five”; and Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said, "For less than forty sheep, zakat is not payable." Malek said: “it is, on this subject, from what I, best, heard to say”. Malek added: “Omar Ibn Al-Khattaba said: "Never to join two parts, and also not to separate two parts, because of the zakat", speaking of those who own flocks. To specify much more: “Never to reunite two separate parts”; supposing that it is a question of three persons, and that each is the owner of forty sheep; in this case, the zakat that everyone owes is one sheep. Furthermore, if the three people had gathered their possession, they can trick by it, the collector, make only one sheep be of zakat; but this is categorically prohibited”. This is what is to be understood from the words of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab: never to unite two parts, and neither to separate two parts”; and "that's the best I've heard, say," Malek says. Chapter XIV Of what is said about the zakat of goats. 
(600) 26 - Soufian Ibn Abdallah reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab gave him the charge, to collect zakat, about newly born rafters and goats. We said to him: “why make this count, without any benefit of zakat”? Back at Omar's, Soufian reports the protests to him; thus Omar says: “Yes, one must count them rafters and goats, which are carried in the arms of the shepherd (still infants), but which are not exigible from the zakat. We don't even have to take the one that is well fed, neither the ewe that has just given birth, nor the pregnant one, nor the stallion of sheep; but the zakat is to be collected in that of two completed years or of four completed years”. "For the owner of sheep whose number is not due for zakat, and for whom the ewes were going to give birth, one day before the collector was entitled to zakat, especially since the births were going to increase the number sheep, which is payable as zakat", Malek said: “If the ewes, from the births they had made, the number of the sheep would increase, reaching a number requiring zakat, this must be paid. Because, the breeding of sheep, and the increase in the number of sheep, are quite different from the number of sheep which one has purchased, or which one has received by inheritance or by gift. It is the same case, of a commodity, the price of which is not worth, its submission to zakat, but on its sale, the owner receives a profit where the zakat is by right, therefore, it is to be paid out of the profit. But if the profit comes from a capital gain, or an inheritance, the zakat is payable after one year has passed, from the day where the interest or inheritance has been affected". Malek said: “The kids and lambs are to be compared to the profits of a capital; however, they are different, in another light namely: if the man is the owner of a sum of gold or silver which owes the zakat, to which he adds another sum; this addition is not subject to zakat when it will be paid for what it had previously, that after the passage of one year, from the day when the new sum was added. But in case the man is the owner of sheep, cows or of camels, whose category of each species is subject to zakat, and he adds a camel, a cow, or a sheep, he must pay zakat for what has been added, when he will have it paid for what he had before if the number deserves to be subject to zakat”. Malek said, "that's the best explanation I've heard about it." Chapter XV Two-year cumulative zakat. 
(601) 27 - Yahia reported that Malek said, "For the man who owns a hundred camels who owe zakat but to whose house the collector does not come to claim it until the day when the zakat became two-year cumulative; and by chance, the man must have lost what he had of camels, having only five, the beggar will not have only entitled to two sheep for zakat on the remaining five camels, in the sense that it is one sheep per year. Zakat in this case is counted only according to what the man possesses on the day when he discharges it whether the herd has perished or been increased. If zakats have been accumulated for several years, he will only pay one zakat and that on the day when it must be paid; and if in that case his herd is no more, or the number has been minimized to such an extent that he does not deserve no longer be subject to zakat, he will have nothing to pay, and no zakat is payable for what has perished from this herd even if the zakat has been accumulated for several years”. Chapter XVI Prohibition, to constrain the subjects from whom one perceives the zakat. 
(602) 28 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported: “Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, being passing by, near a herd of sheep which is due for zakat, noticed a sheep with large and swollen udders; he asked where this sheep came from”?; "she does part of the zakat”, they answered him; "I don't believe that her owner handed her over. willingly"! Omar retorted and added, "Never seek to embarrass people, take nothing that is so precious from Muslims, and avoid claiming from them, dairy females under zakat." 
(603) 29 - Muhammad Ibn Yahia Ibn Habban reported that two men from the tribe “Achja”, recounted, that Muhammad Ibn Maslama Al-Ansari, on his way to collect zakat, he said to the debtor: “Select the zakat of your goods”. He did not refuse a sheep that his owner thought she was an acquittal of what he owed”. Malek said, "What was followed in Medina, and that moreover, I have heard versed men say, it is not to push Muslims to coercion by claiming zakat from them and to accept from them, all good, that they handed over. Chapter XVII Alms, and those who are entitled to them. 
(604) 30 • Ata Ibn Yassar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “Almsgiving is not permitted to the rich, it is actually permitted for five people: a fighter in the way of Allah, a beggar for alms, a man in debt, a man who buys it with his own money, and a man having a poor neighbor to whom alms have been given, which will be given by the latter to the rich man”. Malek said, “What is of follow-up, in the distribution of alms, is that it be made according to the choice of the governor, according to even his forecast, thus, he can deliver to one of the persons, mentioned above, according to his need, and as much as the governor thinks fit; a year or two later, he will give to other people, always considering what is necessary for them; that's what the scholars were happy to do," according to Malek's words. On the other hand, those who work for alms, says Malek, are only entitled to a specific percentage, unless the governor goes to apply any standard other than necessity”. Chapter XVIII The quest for alms and the insistence on covering them 
(605) 31 - Malek reported that Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq said: "If men refuse to give me zakat, I will fight against them, to get it". 
(606) 32 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab drank milk which he found good; he asked the man who gave it to him to drink, the origin of this milk? He told him that he was near a spring, and mentioned his name, he met a herd of animals, whose zakat was due, which was drinking. He asked for a drink, they gave him milk, which he took and filled his skin. Then Omar, put his hand in his mouth, and vomited what he had already drunk». Malek said, “He who refuses the accomplishment of one of the prescriptions, imposed by Allah and which the Muslims could not follow, they will have every right, to fight against this man until he gives it to them”. 
(607) 33 - It was reported to Malek that one of Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz's prefects told him writes, which follows: “a man refused to perform zakat of his property”; Omar, replied to him in writing: “beware of him, and do not take part of his zakat, with Muslims”. The man, put in aware of what had taken place, fell into pain, and even became sickly; at this time, he hastened to pay his zakat; the prefect of Omar, let him know what is due to this man; Omar hardly protested and said, "Take this zakat." Chapter XIX From the estimated zakat of harvesting dates and grapes 
(608) 34 - Busr Ibn Sa'id reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "lands watered by the rain and the water channels, we pay a zakat which is equivalent to one tenth of the crop; of those who are watered by water drawn from wells or through pumps, the zakat is half of a tenth”. 
(609) 35 - Ziad Ibn Sa'id reported that Ibn Chehab said: one does not take zakat from bad quality dates, called "al-jou'rour"; or “mousran-el-fara”, nor “azq ibn houbaiq”; they are counted for their owner but without being subject to zakat”. Malek said, “this is to compare to sheep, which are reckoned with goats, and these goats are in no way subject to zakat. It is about even for some fruits of which some species are not designed for alms, for example "Al-Bourdi" (one of the best qualities of dates); thus one takes neither good nor bad quality; one is in preference for what is of average quality”. Malek said: "what we esteems that among the fruits in Medina, it is especially dates and grapes, and that as soon as they are ripe and suitable for sale. It is that the fruits of palm trees and vines are eaten as fresh dates and fresh grapes. They are valued as long as they are fruits in the trees, so that their owners will be at ease and no longer in embarrassment after this valuation; then we leave to the owners the right to dispose as they see fit, of the delivery of their alms according to what has been estimated. Malek said: “For this which are fruits which are not eaten fresh, but which are used after the harvest like cereals, they are not to be valued; but we leave to their owners, and that after having harvested, treated, winnowed, so that they become grains ready to be consumed, the whole confidence in their loyalty, to give alms in case the quantity piled up, is due. And this subject is indisputable. Malek added: “what is followed in Medina is that, the palms are esteemed, while having their fruits on their trees; once these fruits ripen and whether they are displayed for sale, zakat is due from dates after cutting the bunches. If the palms are attacked with a plague after they have been esteemed, and before the bunches are cut, and the plagues deprive the palms of all their fruits, zakat, is no longer required. If, among what remains, the quantity is five 'Wasqs and beyond according to the 'sa' of the Prophet r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), zakat is to be considered in this quantity and not in that which has been lost". The same process is to be followed for the vineyards. If we have in different places, or that one owns lots in common with others of so that the lot alone is not subject to zakat, but together, the whole becomes subject to zakat, which must be paid”. Chapter XX The zakat of grains and olives 
(610) 36 - Malek reported that he inquired about the zakat of olives, near Ibn Chehab who answered him: "it is of the tenth". Malek said: "zakat intended for the olive, is of the tenth, but after having pressed it, and that the quantity be five “Wasqs” and above; if it is less, the zakat is no longer entitled. And the olive trees are considered the palm trees, about watering: let the land planted with olive trees be watered by the rain and the springs of water, the zakat, is there of the tenth; watered by water drawn from wells or others, it is half a tenth; for the olive trees, there is no need to estimate them, whereas the olives are always on the trees». As for grains that people save to eat later, the zakat is one-tenth if the land is watered by rain or springs. water; it is half of a tenth if the watering is done by the water brought. We must take into account that the weight is five "Wasqs" according to the "sa'" of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (On him the grace and peace of Allah), Malek said, and always about the grains, that what is subject to them are the following kinds: wheat, barley, soult (kind of barley), maize, millet , rice, lentil, vetch, bean, sesame and other genera similar to them, and are for food use. However the zakat, intended for these grains, is of right, once they are harvested and shelled. And, people are payable at this zakat, and we accept from them whatever they give". And, Malek was asked the time, when the zakat olives, which is either one tenth or one half of the second, is to be paid; is it before or after the maintenance fee reduction? He answered: “one does not have to consider the expenses which the owners take care of, just like the case of the food and one is only interested in what is declared. He, in whom the weight of the olives is five “Wasqs” and beyond, the zakat is one-tenth of the oil, after the olive has been pressed; if the weight is less, the zakat is not due”. Malek said, “He who sells his crop of grains after they have become dry, unharmed and kept in their husks, has to pay zakat himself, and not the buyer. And the grains can only be sold after having dried up in their envelopes, and without their still needing water, to water them”. Malek said, "for the verse: 'Pay the duties on the day of harvest' Quran VI, 141, interpreting it: it is about zakat, which is to be paid, and it says -he, "which I have heard of many". Malek finally said: “He who sells his garden, or its land, which gives crops, or fruit trees, but, at the time when the fruits are not edible, it is up to the buyer to pay zakat. In case the fruits have become edible, the seller owes this zakat unless it suits the buyer”. Chapter XXI Fruits exempt from zakat. 
(611) 37 - Malek said: "for the man, who, after picking or harvesting, obtains only four Wasqs of dates, or four Wasqs of raisins, or four Wasqs of wheat, or four Wasqs of floury grains, he will not have to collect the everything, so that it is subject to zakat; because this one is due when the weight of any species, namely, dates, raisins, wheat, or floury grains, is five Wasqs, according to the "sa'" of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and in accordance with the words of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): "for less than five Wasqs, zakat is not payable". In case, any species, previously mentioned, has a weight of five Wasqs, zakat is payable, if the weight is less, zakat is not. For more precision, suppose that the man picked five Wasqs of dates, and that independently of their gender and color; he will have to collect everything and then pay the zakat; if the weight is less than five, zakat is not paid. It is the same for wheat, brown or white, for barley, vetch, all considered one species the man must meet to pay the zakat if the weight is five Wasqs or more than five Wasqs; and if it is less than five, the zakat is not payable. As for raisins where one has black and red, which, being picked, and their weight is five Wasqs, man has to pay zakat. If the weight is less than five, zakat is not payable. As for floury grains, they are all considered as one species, just like wheat, dates and raisins without emphasizing their names or colours. Grains are said to be: peas, lentils, beans and vetches, and all that is considered by people to be floury grains. If the man had to harvest five Wasqs' according to the "sa'" of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) from all these grains, mixed together without distinguishing the species, he must combine them to pay the zakat, if it is due) Malek said: "And Omar Ibn Al-Khattab distinguished between mealy grains and wheat, when he collected zakat of the Nabataeans; he considered that all mealy grains constitute a single species and took from them, the tenth for zakat, and half of the tenth of the wheat and dates, always for zakat. Malek added: “If we protests saying: how to accept, the meeting of different kinds of floury grains so that the total is subject to zakat, and consequently, man can exchange from hand to hand a measure of one of these species for two of another, whereas this exchange cannot in any case take place, from hand to hand, for two measures of one kind of wheat against two of a different kind? The answer was the following: "gold and silver are brought together in order to pay zakat, and one can, on the other hand, exchange one dinar for several multiples of silver from hand to hand". Malek said: “for this which is palm trees which are owned between two men, and who pick eight Wasqs of dates from them, they do not have to pay zakat. If one of them picks five Wasqs, and the other four or less and the picking is from the same land, it is to the first that zakat is due, as for the other he is exempt. It is the same case for the associates, in the harvest of the grains obtained after the harvest, or of the dates after their cutting, or of the grape after its picking. If each of them will have five Wasqs of cut dates, or picked grapes, or grains broke, he must pay zakat on them; for the one whose share is less than five Wasqs, he is exempt from zakat, which will be paid by the one whose share is five Wasqs, and more”. Malek said, "What is followed in Medina is that for the man who has paid what he owes for zakat of the different kinds of wheat, dates, raisins, and cereals, then he retains them for a few years, after which he will sell them, the zakat is not entitled to be paid only after the lapse of one year, from the day on which the sale took place, because this is considered as for the usufruct or other and no longer for the trade. This is to be considered just like food, store of grain and commodities which man can keep for a number of years in order to sell them later for gold and silver; in this case, he will only have to pay zakat after the lapse of a year, from the very day on which the sale took place. But if these species are intended as articles of commerce, their owner must perform zakat on them, when he sells them, if he had kept them for a year, after paying zakat on the day he had already bought them”. Chapter XXII Of what is not subject to zakat, fruits, vegetables and cereals Malek said, “here that is of tradition, and which I have moreover heard said by the men paid is that not all fruits are subject to zakat such as pomegranates, plums, figs and the like, of all fruits. The same is true for vegetables and cereals, where there is no zakat until one year has elapsed from the day of their sale and the collection of the price”. Chapter XXIII From the zakat of slaves, horses, and honey. 
(612) 38 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "The Muslim, is exempt from zakat in the subjects of his slave, and his horse". 
(613) 39 - Suleiman Ibn Yassar reported that the people of Syria said to Ubaidallah Ibn Al-Jarrah: "Take what is zakat for our horses and our slaves”; but he refused, then wrote to Omar Ibn Al-Khat-tab, about this, who in turn refused. Syrians insisted on zakat, to Oubaidallah, who rewrote to Omar, whose response was: "If it satisfies them, take the zakat, and return theirs, offering it to their slaves”. And Malek recalls that the slaves were understood to be the poor”. 
(614) 40 - Abdallah Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm reported: "My father, being in Mina, received from Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz a letter, which said, not to take zakat neither for the honey nor for the horse. 
(615) 41 - Abdallah Ibn dinar reported: "I asked Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab about the zakat of horses"? He replied, “Is there any zakat on them”? Chapter XXIV The capitation imposed on the People of the Book and the Magi. 
(616) 42 - Ibn Chehab narrated: "I was told that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the favor and peace of Allah) had received the capitation of the Magi of "Bahrain ". And that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had perceived it from the Magi of “Persia” and Osman Ibn Affan, from the “Berbers”. 
(617) 43 - Ja’far Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ali reported from his father that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, alluding to the Magi, said: "I don't know how behave with them”? Abdel-Rahman Ibn Auf replied: "I testify that I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) say: "Treat them like the People of the Book". 
(618) 44 - Aslam, the slave of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab reported: "Omar Ibn Al-Khattab charged tax, the owners of the gold, for a value of four dinars, as well as those of the silver forty dirhams. This was for the benefit of the Muslims to help them, and to be hospitable to travellers”. 
(619) 45 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that his father said to Umar Ibn Al-Khattab: "Among the mounts there is a blind camel"; Omar to answer: “To give it to a poor family to use it”; I replied, "but she is blind”; He retorted: "Let it be treated with tar"; I answered: “How then, can she feed on the grass”?. Omar asked, “is it tax goods or zakat goods ”? "She's tax goods" I said. “By Allah, said Omar, you want to eat his flesh”. - She has the tax mark,” I said. Omar then gave the order to cut his throat, and he had nine dishes which, were well filled with fruits and other foods; he sent these dishes to the wives of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) the last of which was given to Hafsa, the daughter of Omar, for the good reason that, if his dish had for content, which is less than in the others, he will consider that as his part. He put in these dishes, flesh of the camel and sent them to the wives of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and with what remains he had a meal, to which he invited the Monhajirines and the Ansars”. Malek said, "I foresee that one should only take from the tributaries what they owe as taxes." 
(620) 46 - It was reported to Malek, that Omar Ibn Abdel Aziz had written to his governors: "To remit the taxes to the tributaries who have embraced Islam". Malek said, “He is from the sunna, not to impose the tax neither on the wives of the People of the Book, nor on their children, and that it is of obligation for pubescent men. On the other hand, the capitation is not collected from those who are protected by the Muslims, nor from the Magi, for what they possess of properties such as palm trees, vines, plantations, herds, because, the alms was in principle only wanted from Muslims, only with the aim of purifying them, and giving it to the poor, And this poll tax was imposed on the People of the Book to humiliate them, they should not, in their countries, no tribute on their own goods, because they concluded a pact of submission, that if they make commercial transactions in the countries of the Moslems, which is besides their end, one perceives the tenth of their transactions. Moreover, the poll tax was imposed on them, and they accepted it, so that they would remain in their country and defend it against the enemy. If one of them leaves his country for another where he will trade, he owes a tenth of his transactions. It is for those who are from Egypt and who leave for Syria, those of Syria for Iraq, those of Iraq for Medina, or for Yemen or other countries (Muslims), all have to pay the tenth. It is tradition that the People of the Book have no zakat, as well as the Magi, in their goods, their herds, their fruits and their plantations. They can even keep their religions, without being obliged to deny them. But, as long as they have to do business in Muslim countries, they must pay the tenth of their transactions, because this does not form a clause of the pact which they concluded, nor a favor which was granted to them. This is what I have seen, applied by the Ulemas of Medina”. Chapter XXV The tithe collected from those who enjoy the protection of Muslims. 
(621) 47 - Salem Ibn Abdallah reported from his father that Omar Ibn Al-Khatab, took from the Nabataeans, half of a tenth of their wheat and their oil, wanting to increase by this, these products in Medina. As for floury grains, he took the tenth”. 
(622) 48 - Al Saib Ibn Yazid said: "I was very young, and worked with Abdallah Ibn Utba Ibn Mass'ud in the market of Medina, in the time of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, and one perceived the tenth of the merchandise of the Nabataeans". 
(623) 49 - Malek asked Ibn Chehab: "By what right Omar Ibn Al-Khattab took from the Nabataeans, the tenth"? He replied: "It had taken place during the pre-Islamic period, and Omar, obliged them to continue to pay it". Chapter XXI Of buying alms and giving back. 
(624) 50 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that his father heard Umar Ibn Al-Khattab say, “I gave alms of a purebred horse to a man, to fight in the way of Allah. The man, with whom the horse was, had it badly maintained; so I wanted to buy it myself at a good price. I asked, on this subject the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) who answered me: “Do not don't buy it, even at the cost of a dirham, because the one who goes back on his alms is to be compared to the dog who goes back on his vomit". 
(625) 51 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab made a horse an alms to be ridden in the fight in the way of Allah. Wanting to buy it, he asked the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) this subject, which replied, "Don't buy it, and don't go back on your alms". Malek was asked at subject of a man who gave alms, who soon afterwards found himself with another than the one to whom it was given, and what the latter wished to sell; could he afford it? He answered: “I prefer that it be abandoned”. Chapter XXVII Those for whom zakat of fitr is payable. 
(626) 52 Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar paid the fitr zakat for his servants - who worked in Khaibar and Wadi Al Qura». (...) 'Malek said: "The best I have heard about the zakat of fitr, paid by man, is that it is paid for those whose he has the responsibility, and for whom, he must spend. And the man pays the zakat of the fitr for his contractual freedman, his posthumous freedman, his slaves present and absent, Provided that they are Muslims, or even that they serve for trade or other. As for those who are not Muslims, zakat is not payable on them”. Malek continued: “As to the runaway slave, whether his boss knows his place or not, and his absence has been for a short time, in the hope of his return and his life, I conceive that he pays zakat fitr about him. In case there is no more to hope for his return, and his absence is long, this zakat is not to be paid". And Malek who adds: “the zakat of the fitr is an obligation on the Bedouins and the townspeople; because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has prescribed it on everyone, whether it is a free man or a slave, a male or a female, as Muslims” .

(629) 56 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar gave for zakat of fitr only dates, except once when it was barley”. Malek said: “All atonements, zakat of fitr, zakat of tithes, in short everything, must be commensurate with the little 'mudd' of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) with the exception of divorce dihar (it is the fact of saying to his wife "Be for me like the back of my mother”), in this case the expiation will be according to the world of Hisham, called the great “moudd”. Chapter XXIX Fixed time for payment of zakat of fitr

And Malek said: "And it is a blessing, if the zakat of fitr is given even at dawn on the day of the feast of fitr, and after." Chapter XXX Of those who are exempt from the zakat of fitr 
(632) 59 Yahia reported that Malek said, “Man does not owe fitr zakat for the slaves of his slaves, nor for his worker, nor for the slave of the woman, except those who are in her service and who are necessary to her.

Yahia reported that he has heard Malek say about the man who sees the new moon of Ramadan by himself: "He must fast, and not break his fast, knowing that this day is the beginning of Ramadan". Malek also said: "He who alone sees the moon of Shawwal should not break the fast, for people will accuse him of a lack of confidence whoever breaks his fast, saying: 'We have seen the new moon' . He who therefore sees the moon of Shawwal, during the day, must not interrupt his fast, but will continue it until the end of the day; and this moon is none other than the sign of the night that will follow”. Yahia reported again that he heard Malek say, "If people are fasting on the day of fitr, believing it to be a day of Ramadan, then they are warned that the moon of Ramadan, was visible, a day before they have started the fast and that day of their fast will be the thirty-first of the month, they must break their fast on that same day, just at the time when they have been warned, however, without they do the prayer of the party, especially if the warning took place after the sun had left the meridian”.

Arrive at “Al-Kadid”, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) asked to bring him a glass of water, he drank it and the people suspended their fast”.

The man replied, "I can't do either." At that moment, the Envoy was brought of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) a basket containing dates; he said to the man: “Take this, in order to to give alms» He replied: «No one needs it. more than me". The Messenger of Allah (upon him the grace and peace of Allah) laughed, so much so that his canines appeared, and said to the man: "Eat some."

The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) asked him: "what is the matter with you"? "I just had carnal intercourse with my wife while fasting at month of Ramadan" answered the man. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said to him: "Are you able to free a slave." No," replied the man. “Can you sacrifice a camel”? - "No" answered the man. "Sit down, then"; we brought, to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) at this time a basket of dates; he gave it to the man saying to him, "Take this and make one alms". The Bedouin says: “No one needs it more than me”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the favor and peace of Allah) said: "Eat it, but to fast one day as expiation for what you have committed". -Ata asked Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab: "what was the weight of the dates contained in this basket"? He replied: "A matter of fifteen to twenty sa's." Malek said, "I have heard versed men say: "He who, for having had carnal intercourse with his wife, or for any other cause, has broken a day of fasting in the month of Ramadan, will not have to make expiation, as moreover, it was mentioned by the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) about the one who has already had reports during the day; but he will have to compensate on that day, in other months of the year”.

(664) 33 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father allowed himself to be bled while fasting, then did not suspend his fast”. And he said, "And I only saw him do that when he was fasting." Malek said: “We disapproves of bloodletting the faster, for fear that he will become weak; and apart from that cause, it is not to be refused. Corn if a man wants to do it without it weakening him, there is no harm in it, and I do not find that he should fast on any other day, except the month of Ramadan, because this bloodletting is considered cause valid for breaking the fast, if it weakens it. The one, so who wants to do a bloodletting while fasting, and intends to be so until the evening, there is nothing wrong with that, and he will not have to compensate by another day". Chapter XI Fasting on the day of Achoura. 
(665) 34 - Urwa reported that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "On the day of Ashura, was a day of fasting for the Quraishites, in the period pre-Islamic, and it was the same for the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah). And when the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) was in Medina and the day of Achoura, he fasted it, and commanded it to be fasted. But when the fast of Ramadan was prescribed, it was considered the only fast that should be followed, and the fast of the day of Achoura was suspended, leaving people the freedom to fast it”. 
(666) 35 - Houmaid Ibn Abdel-Rahman Ibn Awf reported that he heard Mu'awia Ibn Abi Sufian, the year he made the pilgrimage, say, on the day of Ashura, while being in the pulpit: “O Médinois! where are your versed men? I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and peace of Allah) say, about this day: "It is the day of Ashura, and Allah has not prescribed it for you, a day of fasting. For me, I fast it, for you others, you can fast it or not”. 
(667) 36 - It was reported to Malek, that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab sent word to Al-Hareth Ibn Hisham: “Tomorrow is the day of Ashura, fast it and order your family to do the same”. Chapter XII From the fast of the two days the fitr and al-adha, and from the omnitemporal fast. 
(668) 37 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the mercy and peace of Allah) forbade fasting both days of fitr (suspension of the fast) and al-adha (the day of sacrifice)”. 
(669) 38 - Malek reported that he has heard, versed men say, "There is no harm in fasting continually, but except fasting for two days which it has moreover been forbidden to fast namely the day of fitr, and that of al-adha; this is what has come down to us”. Malek added: this is my favorite thing”. Chapter XIII From the prohibition of continuous fasting (for two ensuing days) 
(670) 39 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), has forbidden to follow the fast for two continuous days”.

(671) 40 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Beware of fasting for two days in a row, take care not to fast for two days in a row”! He was told: “but you, you are fasting, O Messenger of Allah”? He replied, “I am not like you; I sleep well fed and watered (by my Allah)”. Chapter XIV From the fast of the one who, by mistake commits a murder or the one who compares his wife "to the back of his own mother". 
(672) 41 - Malek said, "The best words I have heard about one who will fast for two months in a row, as an atonement, for not having, by mistake killed another man or by reason of having compared his wife to the back of his own mother in case he is suffering from a disease which obliges him to suspend his fast, to have to postpone the fast until he is cured, and to resume the fast taking into account the days he has already fasted". It is the same for the woman who owes this fast, if by mistake she kills a person, she a to suspend her fast during the period of her menses, then once purified, that she resume the fast without any delay taking into account the days she has already fasted”. And there is no cause, for the one who must fast for two consecutive months, - as it was mentioned in the Book of Allah - to break his fast if it is not for a cause of illness, or for the question of menses; therefore , he must not travel so that he does not break his fast”. And Malek said, 'that's the best I've heard about it'. Chapter XV What the patient should do regarding his fast. 
(673) 42 - Malek said: "What I have heard men versed in religion say about one who is stricken with an illness, in such a way that his fast seems to him so painful and tiring, even to give up his unbearable state, that he can suspend his fast. It is the same for the sick person who cannot say his prayers on his feet because of his illness; and Allah knows better than anyone his condition, and the seriousness of his illness, therefore, he can pray while sitting, because the religion of Allah is to facilitate the practice”. On the other hand. Allah has The traveler is tolerated to miss the fast, although he is much more capable of doing so than the patient. Allah, the Most High said in his Book: “Whoever among you is sick, or who travels, shall then fast an equal number of days”. Koran II, 184. Allah, therefore, has tolerated for the traveler, the breaking of the fast, although he is much more capable than the sick person of fasting”. This is what I heard from God, and this is what is traditionally followed”. Chapter XVI Of the vow to fast and fasting on behalf of the dead. 
(674) 43 - Sa'id Ibn Musaiab was asked about a man, who took a vow to fast for a month. Can he fast on other days (as a supererogation)? He replied, "Let the vow be performed first, and then fast other fasts." Malek said: “It was the same opinion of Suleiman Ibn Yassar”. Malek said, “He who dies before fulfilling a vow to free a slave, or perform a supererogatory fast, or pay the zakat of a camel, and that he stipulates in his will, his successor must execute it in the inheritance, and which is equivalent to a third of what the man has bequeathed; and this is to be considered as a priority, of all other stipulations unless there is such a thing. Because of all that he has done as a vow or otherwise, nothing is obligatory, and is not even to be considered as a supererogatory act which can only be taken from a third of what he bequeathed, without touching the capital. If it has him been allowed, the dead would have delayed this until the moment when death presents itself to him and the property will go to his successors, he will have designated all these things that no one has the right to claim them except after a dispute brought to justice and in this way, this dead could designate all this until death, presenting itself to him to dispose of all his capital, which he will not have the right to do”. 
(675) 44 - It was reported to Malek whom Abdallah Ibn Omar was often asked "Is it permissible for a man to fast for another, or to pray in place of another". He replied: “No one can fast or pray in place of another”. Chapter XVII Of fasting on days other than Ramadan and their atonement. 
(676) 45 - Khaled Ibn Aslam reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, suspended his fast on a day of Ramadan, as the sky was cloudy, and believing that the sun had disappeared. A man came and said to him: “O prince of believers! The sun has appeared”; Omar answered: "what I have just done is not serious, and I only made the application of my own lights". And Malek, wanting to explain the above said: “Omar, designate by "it does not matter", that he intends to compensate for the day on which the fast was broken, by another, because it is only a question of a single day which is so easy to fast”. And Allah is most knowledgeable about this.” 
(677) 46 - Nafe’a reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "He who must fast for several days in compensation for other days of fasting broken in Ramadan, for causes of illness or travel, he must fast uninterruptedly". 
(678) 47 - Ibn Chehab a reported that Abdallah Ibn Abbas and Abu Huraira had argued over compensation for the fast, for breaking it for a few days in Ramadan. One said to himself, "He must fast them consecutively, the other: he can fast them separately”. The reporter added: “I don't know which of them said: 'He can fast them separately'. 
(679) 48 - Nafe’a reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said, “Whoever vomits voluntarily, while fasting, must fast another day. As for the one who cannot hold back his vomit, he can dispense”. 
(680) 49 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab ask about compensation for fasting. He replied: “If a man has to fast a few days, to compensate for others in the month of Ramadan, I prefer that he fast them, without interruption”. Yahia reports that he has heard Malek say: “He who fasts several days in order to compensate for other days of the month of fasting, by separating them, must not do them again without interruption; what he has done is sufficient, although I prefer that the compensated fast be done without interruption”. Malek said, "He who inadvertently or by forgetfulness, in Ramadan or even, during a compensated fast, will go to eat or drink, he must fast on other days by acquittal”. 
(681) 50 - Malek a reported that Houmaid Ibn Qais Al-Makki related to him: "I was with Mujahed, in a processional tour around the Ka'ba, when a man came to ask him about the fasting days of atonement, if they are to be done without interruption or separated? Houmaid replied: "Certainly he can separate them by fasting." But Mujahed added: “He must, fast them without interruption, because according to the recitation of Ubai Ibn Ka'b, they must be three days in a row”. Malek added: “It is better that they be fasted without interruption, as revealed by Allah in the Qur'an". Malek was asked at about a woman who while fasting, in Ramadan, had a flow of blood in the morning, without it being her menses, then waits for the evening to see if she will be in such a state, but she does not see none of that. Then the next morning, she will have a flow, less than the first, which stops even before a few days of her menses, what should this woman do and for her fasting and her prayer”? He replied, “This flow is due to menstruation, so she must break her fast, and will have to compensate for these days later after the month of fasting. Once her menses stop let her make her lotion and fast”. Malek was asked about a man who just on the last day of Ramadan converted to Islam. Should he fast only the day of his conversion to Islam, or every day of this month”? He answered: “He does not have to fast the days that have passed, by way of compensation; but he must fast the days that follow them, although I prefer that he fast on the day he converted to Islam”. Chapter XVIII Of the acquittal of voluntary fasting. 
(682) 51 - Ibn Chehab reported that Aisha and Hafsa, the wives of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) I (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was fasting voluntarily, when, in the morning, they were presented with food, they broke their fast. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) entering their home, Aisha said: “Hafsa, who looked like his father (Umar) took the initiative and asked the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): “O, Messenger of Allah, I was performing a voluntary fast, with Aicha, when, having received a food, we broke our fast”? He replied, "Fast by substitution another day." Yahia reported that he has heard Malek say: "Anyone who, doing a voluntary fast, has, by mistake or forgetfulness, eaten or drunk, may continue his fast for the rest of the day without being obliged to fast another day. Thereby, one who fasts voluntarily and who breaks his fast for any reason, will not have to fast another day; for the breaking of the fast is due to a valid cause without it being by his will. On the other hand, the one who makes a voluntary prayer and who accidentally, became impure, in such a way that he must redo his ablutions to continue his prayer, can dispense with this prayer". Malek added: "It is not suitable for a man who, practicing religious works (al-amal as-saliha) of those which are obligatory such as prayer, pilgrimage, fasting and any other worship practice, when he performs them as supererogatory works, not performing them as obligations, when he does them as supererogatory as in the case where, he makes the takbir without accomplishing the two raka'ts, likewise the voluntary fast which he breaks before the evening, he makes the talbiat of the pilgrimage and returns home before he completes it, finally he makes the processional rounds (Tawaf) before completing the seven rounds. It is improper for him to omit a rite before he performs it to perfection, unless something happens to him that constrains him such as illness and the like. valid excuse. For Allah the Exalted said in his Book: "Eat and drink until one can distinguish at dawn a thread white with a black wire. Then fast until nightfall. Koran II, 187. Man must fast. Allah also said: "Do for Allah the small and the great pilgrimage" (Koran 11,196). If a man performs the talbiat of a voluntary Hajj when he has performed the obligatory pilgrimage, he is not allowed to leave his irham before he completes his pilgrimage. And any man beginning a supererogatory work must complete it, as if it were a prescribed obligation. That's the best interpretation I've heard about it." Chapter XIX Of the redemption of those who do not fast in Ramadan, for a valid cause 
(683) 52 - Malek reported that Anas Ibn Malek, paid the fidya (he redeemed himself) when he reached old age, and he could no longer fast. Malek added: "I don't I don't think it's obligatory and I prefer that he fast if he is able to do so. For he who redeems himself must give food, for each day to the poor, a mudd of food according to the mudd of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah). 
(684) 53 - We asked Abdallah Ibn Omar about the pregnant woman who fears for her fetus, if fasting causes her weakness? He answered: “Let her stop fasting and that she gives food to the poor, for each day, a mudd of wheat which is equivalent to the mudd of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and peace of Allah). Malek said: “Men paid provide that she must fast other days by way of compensation, in accordance with the words of Allah to Him the power and the glory: "Whoever of you is sick or travels, then shall fast an equal number of days." Coran II, 184. They consider that her pregnancy and her fear of her child are only a disease”. 
(685) 54 - Abdel Rahman Ibn al-Kassem reported that his father said: “He who had to fast for a few days and he has not done so, until the advent of the following Ramadan, he must give, for each day, to eat to the poor, a moudd of wheat, while fasting what he must of days". (...) 55 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Joubair was of the same opinion». Chapter XX Of the acquittal of the fast. 
(686) 56 - Abu Salama Ibn Abdel-Rahman reported that he heard Aicha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say: "I happened to have to days of fasting in the month of Ramadan, and I could only fast them in the month of Sha'ban". Chapter XXI From the fast of the day that one doubts. 
(687) 57 - Malek a of course, men versed in religion, prohibit fasting on the day of which one doubts in the month of Cha'ban, if one intends to consider it the first day of Ramadan. And, they considered that the one who will have fasted it without the vision of the new moon (of Ramadan) following which, one comes to assure that it is, in fact, the first day of Ramadan, he must fast it on another day, and they find no harm in fasting this day as supererogatory”. And Malek adds: “Such is what is our traditions, and which was moreover followed in Medina”. Chapter XXII Fasting and its merit. 
(688) 58 - Abu Salama Ibn Abdel Rahman reported that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) used to fast so much that one said that he did not break the fast, and ate what one said he was not fasting. And I have never seen the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace fast and the peace of Allah) fasting completely for a month except Ramadan. His voluntary fast was often done in the month of Sha'ban. (689) 59- Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the mercy and peace of Allah) said: “Fasting is protection. If any of you is fasting, let him not speak indecently, let him not commit unseemly acts; if anyone insults or attacks him, let him say: “I am fasting, I am fasting”. 
(690) 60 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "By him who holds my soul in his hand, the smell of the mouth of the fasting person is more fragrant with Allah than the smell of musk. He discarded his desire, his food and his drink for Me. Fasting belongs to Me and it is Me who gives the reward. Any good deed will be multiplied tenfold and can go up to seven hundred multiples; as for fasting, it belongs to Me and it is I who will determine the reward”. 
(691) 61 - Abu Houraira said: "When it is the month of Ramadan, the gates of Paradise open, the gates of Hell close, and the demons are chained". 
(692) 62 - Malek a of course, men versed in religion, do not prohibit the use of siwak (rubbing teeth made from a branch of an "arrak" wood) in the month of Ramadan, during the day, neither at its beginning nor at its end. And, none of them have it repulsed. For the question, the six-day fast, (namely at Shawwal) following the month of Ramadan, Malek said, “That he saw no ulema and no religiously educated man fasting them; and he was not even informed of this question by a predecessor. Even men shy away from it lest the ignorant and the common people attribute to the month of Ramadan, which is unsuitable and strange to it, which will be a innovation, especially if they argue by permission of men versed in religion”. Yahia reported that he has heard Malek say, "I have never heard, none of the men versed in religion, neither of those who are learned, nor of those who are follows, prohibit the fast of the day on Friday; and his fasting is beneficial; I even saw some of them fasting for it while looking for it». MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 19 The spiritual retreat First chapter The spiritual retreat. 
(693) 1 Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "When the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was retreating spiritual, he held out his head to me to clean and comb it. And he only came home for the satisfaction of a natural need. 
(694) 2 - Amrah Bint Abdel-Rahman reported: "when Aicha was doing the retreat, she asked for news of the sick while walking, without stopping." Malek said, "He who makes a spiritual retreat, must not take care of any personal business, nor go out to seek him, nor help anyone in any work, but he can only leave the mosque for the satisfaction of a natural need. And if he were allowed to go out, from the place of retreat, he could visit a sick person, or follow a funeral procession and pray over a dead person». And Malek added: “he who does itikaf is only said in itikaf, only if he abstains from avoiding what a man who does not make this retreat should occupy, namely visiting a sick person, following a funeral procession by saying the funeral prayer, and satisfying a natural need by entering his home”. 
(695) 3 - Malek a asked Ibn Chehab about the man who is in retreat, is it permissible for him to enter a covered place for the satisfaction of a need? He replied, "Yes, there is nothing wrong with that." Malek said, “What is indisputable is that there is no harm in performing itikaf in any mosque where Friday services are held. The aversion is, that the moutakif (in spiritual retreat) leaves the mosque where he was doing his retreat, for another where the Friday prayer is performed, or that he neglected. If it is a mosque where the common Friday prayer is not performed, and the one who makes his retreat there is not obliged to leave it for another mosque where the Friday prayer is performed, I find no harm in this, for Allah the Blessed and the Most High has said (meaning): "When you are in retreat in the mosque" Koran II, 187. And Allah, in this verse mentioned all the mosques, without any particularity”. And Malek said, “so, it is concluded that it was permissible for the man to make his retreat in the mosque where the Friday service was not held, and could not leave this mosque to go to the one where Friday prayers were held?. Malek also said: "the retiree will spend the night only in the mosque where he had made his retirement unless it is in one of the squares of this mosque. And I never heard that the pensioner will put up a tent where he will spend his night; because he had to stay in the mosque or in one of its courts”. And which shows that the pensioner was to spend the night only in the mosque, these are the words of Aicha: "When the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was in a retreat spiritual, he only returned home to satisfy a natural need. On the other hand, one should not make the retreat either on the roof of a mosque, or in its turret”. Malek added: “The retiree enters the place he has chosen to be the place of his spiritual retreat and this before sunset, of the first night when he has decided to begin his retreat so that he is ready to receive his first night, while being in retreat, without it being preoccupied with some other matter such as trade or the like. There is no harm in him entrusting others with his affairs concerning his own property or that of his family, even to allow them to sell what he owns, or something else that does not require his intervention. There is no harm in him entrusting a third person with taking care of all this”. Malek adds: "I have no never heard anyone of the men versed in the religion, underline a precise condition to make the spiritual retreat, because, this one is nothing but one of the religious practices just like prayer, fasting, pilgrimage and other similar practice, in short, prescribed either it or supererogatory. Thus, whoever decides to exercise such a practice, must follow the predecessors without involving an innovation that Muslims have not made, nor imposing something on others or on himself. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) made this retreat and Muslims knew how it should be practiced”. Malek finally concluded, that the retreat and the stay in the mosque are similar and can be practiced by a city-dweller and a Bedouin, in the same way”. Chapter II of what cannot be neglected as a religious obligation in the spiritual retreat (itikaf). 
(696) 4 - We reported to Malek, that Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad and Nafe', the freedman of Abdallah Ibn Omar, said: "No spiritual retreat is feasible, without fasting", and this by reference to the words of Allah the Blessed and The Most High (meaning): “Eat and drink until a white thread can be distinguished at dawn from a black thread. Then fast until nightfall. Have no relation with your wives when you are retired in the mosque” Koran II, 187. Allah, in this verse, mentioned retirement with fasting”. Malek said: "It is, moreover, what we have followed, that there is no retreat except with fasting". Chapter III The exit of the retired moutakif to attend the party. 
(697) 5 - Soumai the freedman of Abu Bakr Ibn Abdel-Rahman reported that Abu Bakr Ibn Abdel-Rahman, being in his spiritual retreat, went out to do its natural need under a roof in a closed room, in the residence of Khaled Ibn Al-Walid. He only returned to his family to attend the feast prayer with the Muslims”. 
(698) 6 - Malek a reported, that he saw the men versed in the religion, making their spiritual retreat in the last decade of Ramadan, and returning home, only to attend the prayer of the feast of the fitr with the people”. Malek added: “It I have also been told about the virtuous men who have gone before us; and that's my favorite thing I've heard". Chapter IV Of the payment of the pension. 
(699) 7 - Aisha reported: "Wanting to make his spiritual retreat (itikaf), the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) went to the place of his retreat, and he was surprised by the presence of the tents erected, among others, the tent of Aicha, and that of Hafsa. Seeing them, he went to find out, and they said to him: "This is Aicha's tent, this other of Hafsa, and finally that of Zainab". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "You believe that you do thereby a pious work?”; then he left the place without beginning his retreat, and made it later in a decade of the month of Shawwal”. Malek was asked, about a man who went to the mosque for spiritual retreat in the last decade of the month of Ramadan; he remained there for a day or two, then fell ill, and left the mosque. Should he make the retreat for what remains of the ten days, if he is cured, or is it dispensed with”? Malek replied: “He has to pay the remaining days of the retreat, if he is cured in Ramadan, or even after, this month ended. And I was told, that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) wanted to make a retreat spirituality in the month of Ramadan, then he returned without accomplishing it, so that, once this month had ended, he left to make his ten-day retreat in the month of Shawwal". On the other hand, the one who voluntarily makes a spiritual retreat, and the one who has to fulfill it, are the same concerning what is ritual to follow, or what is not ritual. And I have not been told that the volunteering of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) concerning the spiritual retreat was only supererogatory”. about the woman, who doing her spiritual retreat, during which, she had her mentrue, Malek said, “She must break her retreat and go home; she will make her purification lotion, and will be at the mosque again as soon as she has purified herself; thus, she will continue, the days that remain to her of her retirement taking into account the days of her menses. It is the same case of a woman, who has to fast for two successive months; having her period, she will purify herself and then continue her fast, considering the days she had already fasted; and it is better that it does not delay them”. 
(700) 8 - Ibn Chehab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) during his retreat, went home, in case he had a need to satisfy". Malek said: “Who is in spiritual retreat (itikaf) does not have to come out of his retreat, so that he follows the funeral procession of his parents or others”. Chapter V Marriage during spiritual retreat. Malek said, “Nothing does not prevent concluding a marriage during the spiritual retreat, provided that there are no carnal relations; it is the same for the retired woman, who can be asked to marry, without there being any cohabitation. The retiree is prohibited from having relations with his wife, both during the night and during the day. And Malek added: “He A retired man is forbidden to touch his wife, nor even to kiss her. And I did not hear, prohibit a woman and a retired man from concluding a marriage, as long as there are no carnal relations; at this time, it is to be prohibited. All the same, nothing prevents the faster from concluding a marriage during his fast. On the other hand, there is a distinction to be made between the marriage concluded by a man in retirement, and that which is made by a man in Ihram. The latter can eat, drink, visit a sick person, attend funeral processions, but does not wear perfume. On the other hand, women and men on retreat (itikaf) can anoint themselves, perfume themselves, and comb their hair, but rarely attend funeral processions, do not pray over the dead, and do not visit the sick. Thereby the conditions of marriage differ from one to another, and this is moreover what is traditionally followed for the question of marriage for the one who is in the state of Ihram, to the one who is in itikaf, and finally to the faster.

(761) 53 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair, remained in Mecca for nine years, making the talbiat for the pilgrimage at the sight of the new moon of Zul-Hijja, and Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair did the same”. Malek said: "The inhabitants of Makkah and others who are there, make the talbiat for pilgrimage and those who are in Makkah and who are not not Meccans, do it where they are without however leaving the sacred enclosure". Malek added: “Those who do the talbiat for the pilgrimage from Mecca, must postpone the processional tour around House, and the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa until their return from Mina. And that's what Abdallah Ibn Omar was doing. Malek was asked about those who do the talbiat during the pilgrimage, of the Medinans or others, at the vision of the moon of Zul-Hijja, how should they make the processional tour? He replied, "for the processional tour which is of obligation, it is to be delayed; and she is the next one the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. However, they can make excess rounds as much as they want, performing two supererogatory raka'ts at the end of every seven rounds. Besides, the companions of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) did the same, when performing the talbiat for the pilgrimage and delayed the processional tour around the House, and the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa until they return from Mina. Thus did Abdallah Ibn Omar”. Malek was asked about a Makkan man; can he make the talbiat for a pious visit from Mecca”? He replied: "He must rather leave the sacred precincts to perform the talbiat". Chapter XV Ihram does not prohibit the adornment of animal victims. 
(762) 54 - Amra Ibn Abdel-Rahman reported that Ziad Ibn Abi Sufian wrote to Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace): "Abdallah Ibn Abbas said: 'Whoever sends an animal to be sacrificed, must abstain from anything from which a pilgrim abstains, until that animal is sacrificed. And as I have already made my offering, let me know in writing, or inform the one who brings this offering”. Amra added: “Aicha replied: “It is not like Ibn Abbas said; myself, I braided with my own hands the garlands of the sacrificed animal of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and peace of Allah), then in turn he put them around the neck of the animal, and he sent it to be guarded by my father. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) did not forbid himself from everything what Allah made lawful for him until he sacrificed his animal. 
(763) 55 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported: "I asked Amra Bint Abdel Rahman, about the man who sends his offering while he remains, will he have to refrain from something?

(764) 56 - Rabi'a Ibn Abdallah Ibn Al-Houdair reported that he saw, in Iraq, a man behaving like a pilgrim. He asked about him, people who said to him: "He ordered that his sacrificial animal be adorned for him, and from then on he behaved like that”. Meeting Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair, I reported to him what was said; he exclaimed: “It is an innovation; and I swear it in the name of the Lord of the Ka'ba". Malek was asked at subject of a man who himself brings his offering by making a bleeding and adorning it at Zoul-Houlaifa, without it being in a state of ihram until its arrival at Al-Jouhfa? He replied, "I don't like not that, and I don't think that man followed what is traditional, because it is not permissible to do that except to a man who adorns his animal for the sacrifice, by bleeding it during the talbiat, and who does not intend to make the pilgrimage, and in this case he sends it and remains with his own”. We also asked to Malek, about the man who brings the beast victim without him still being in a state of ihram"? He replied, "There is nothing wrong with that." And we asked him again for the question of the man who does not want to perform either the pilgrimage or the pious visitation; should he be in ihram state to adorn the sacrificial beast, because this matter has created a debate among people”? He replied: "We will have to follow, the hadith narrated by Aisha, the mother of the believers, where it is said that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had sent his sacrificed beast then he remained without forbidding himself from the things that Allah made lawful for him until the beast was sacrificed”. Chapter XVI What should a woman who has her period during the pilgrimage do? 
(765) 57 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "The woman who has her period and who does the talbiat for a pilgrimage or a pious visit, may, if she wishes, perform it, but she will not make the processional tour around the Sacred House, nor the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. She can perform all other rites with people, except doing the tour and the route, and she cannot go to the mosque until she has become pure".

(767) 59 - Urwa reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) made only three visits pious: one was in the month of Shawwal and the other two during Zul-Ka'da". 
(768) 60 - Abdel-Rahman Ibn Harmala al-Aslami reported that a man asked Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab: "May I pay a pious visit before the pilgrimage"? He replied: "Certainly, yes, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had made a pious visit before the pilgrimage". 
(769) 61 - Sa'id Ibn al-Musaiab reported that Omar Ibn Abi Salama asked permission from Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, to make a pious visitation in the month of Shawwal, and he got permission. Having made the pious visitation, Omar Ibn Abi Salama returns to his family, without performing the pilgrimage”. Chapter XVIII Of the interruption of the talbiat during the pious visitation. 
(770) 62 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father would break the talbiat if he entered the sacred enclosure while making a pious umra visitation”. Malek said about one who is in the state of ihram, in "Al-Tan'im": "that he must break the talbiat at the sight of the Sacred House". We asked to Malek about the man who would like to do his irham for a pious visit from one of the mikat being a Medinan or other? When should he break the talbiat”? He replied, "Whoever is in the state of ihram from one of the two mikat, must interrupt the talbiat once he arrives at the Sacred House”. And he adds: “I was told that Abdallah Ibn Omar was doing this”. Chapter XIX El Hajj at Tamattou 
(771) 63 Mouhammad Ibn Abdallah Ibn Al-Hareth Ibn Abdel-Mouttaleb reported that he heard Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas and Al-Dahaq Ibn Qais, the year that Mu'awia Ibn Abi Soufian made the pilgrimage alluding to at Tamattou ( the enjoyment of a normal life between the pious visitation and the pilgrimage.) Al-Dahaq Ibn Qais said, "It will only be done by one who is ignorant of Allah's command to Him be power and glory." Sa'd to reply: “it is not correct what you have just said, o son of my brother”. al-Dahaq answered him: "Now, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab forbade it"; Sa'd continued: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), did this, and we have accomplished it with him”. 
(772) 64 - Sadaqa Ibn Yassar reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: “By Allah! Do a pious visit and offering a sacrifice before the pilgrimage, is more pleasing to me than making a pious visit, following the pilgrimage in the month of "Zoul-Hijjà". 
(773) 65 - Abdallah Ibn Dinar reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: "He who does the pious visit in the months of Chawal or Zoul Ki'da or Zoul-Hijjà, before the pilgrimage then resides in Mecca until the time of the pilgrimage, can enjoy a normal life if he makes the pilgrimage. And he will sacrifice the offering which is easy for him to have; if he can't find it, let him fast for three days during the pilgrimage, and seven when he returns home”. Malek has interpreted this by saying, "If he resides to Mecca until the pilgrimage, and makes his pilgrimage the same year". Malek, about a Meccans who leave this city to reside elsewhere, then return to make a pious visit during the month of the pilgrimage and stay in Mecca, from where he will begin the pilgrimage - said: "this man will have enjoyed a normal life and will have to make the offering or fast if he does not possess no offering, and so shall be considered a Meccans." Malek was asked about a man who was not a Meccans, but went to Mecca for a pious visit pilgrimage and deciding to stay there until making the pilgrimage. Will he be taken for a man who enjoys a normal life? He answered: “Yes, certainly he will have a normal life, but he is not considered a Meccans, even if he decides to stay there. And this, because he entered Mecca although he was not one of its inhabitants, and sacrifice and fasting are obligatory for those who are not Meccans. And this man wants to stay there, but he doesn't know if he will be able to stay there with certainty, not being a Meccans. 
(774) 66 Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab say: “He who pays a pious visit to the months of ChawaI, or Zoul-;Ki'da or Zoul-Hijja, then resides in Makkah until the pilgrimage takes place, he can enjoy a normal life in case he will make the pilgrimage. He will make the offering if it seems simple to him, or he will have to fast for three days during the pilgrimage and seven when he returns home". Chapter XX Circumstances in which hajj at Tamattou is not obligatory 
(775) 67 Malek said: "Whoever pays a pious visit to the months of Shawwal, or Zul-Ki'da or Zul-Hijja, then returns to his own, and fulfills the same year the pilgrimage, will not have to make an offering: because the offering is obligatory for the one who has made a pious visit in the month of the pilgrimage then he remains (in Mecca) until the period of the pilgrimage, for perform it. And anyone who goes to Makkah from all directions, to stay there, so that he makes the pious visit during the month of pilgrimage and then performs the pilgrimage, he is not held as one who enjoys 'a normal life; therefore, he does not have to make any sacrifice, nor to fast, and he is considered just like a Meccans if he lives in Makka during this period”. Malek was asked, About a Meccans who left to be at the border, or for some trip, then returned to Mecca, wanting to stay there, whether there were relatives or not; he entered Mecca to perform Umrah, and his pious visit was begun to the places which were determined by the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) or closer than that. In this case, will he be like the one who enjoys a normal "tamattou" life? He replied, "He does not need to make an offering or fast like one who enjoys a normal life, for Allah, the Blessed and Most High said in His Book (meaning): "This is for the one who does not have a family near the mosque Sacred”.

And he has to make another pious visit, starting it, from the moment he missed the previous one, and to be in a state of ihram from the same place where he began his failed first pious visit, unless that place is a little further than the designated places; in this case he will put himself in a state of ihram from the place where he will begin his visit recovering first”. - And Malek adds: "Whoever enters Mecca, to perform a pious visit, making the processional rounds around the Sacred House, and the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, while being in ritual impurity, or even without having made his ablutions and then traded with his wife, and let him remember it", Malek says: "Let him make lotion or his ablutions, then return to do the processional rounds again, as well as the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, then he performs a pious visit and sacrifices an offering. As for the woman, who, had carnal intercourse with her husband, while she was in the state of ihram, she will act similarly to the man”. - Malek finally said: “The pious visit must be started from "Al-Tan'im", the one who leaves the sacred precinct to be afterwards in a state of ihram, this will be admitted if Allah wills; however, he has much more merit, to start doing the talbiat from the very place than the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had designated, or another that is much further than Al-Tan'im".

Malek was asked, about the man who in state of ihram is compelled to eat the meat of a dead animal? Can he hunt and eat from his hunt, or will he be able to eat meat from the dead animal? He replied: "Let him eat the meat of the dead animal because Allah the Blessed and the Most High has not allowed the one who is in the state of ihram neither to eat of the game, nor to to have part whatever the circumstance; but He tolerated the meat of the dead animal when necessary”. And Malek to say: "He is not permitted. for anyone whether in irham state or not to eat game hunted or sacrificed by someone in irham state And I have heard this said, from more than one person. who kills what he hunts and then eats it, he owes one atonement, and he is like he who kills and does not eat. Chapter XXI Of the offense of hunting in the sacred enclosure. 
(796) 89 - Malek said: "all that is game hunted in the sacred enclosure, or maintained by a dog to be killed in a free environment is by no means lawful to eat.

Chapter XXVII Judgment on hunting. 
(797) 90 - Malek said: "Allah, the Blessed and Most High has said: 'O believers! Do not kill game while you are holy. Whoever among you deliberately kills any, let him compensate, either by some animal of the herd, similar to what he has killed, of which two of yourselves, people of integrity, will judge, and it will be like an offering that one makes to attain the Ka'ba either by expiation, by feeding the poor, or by the equivalent of fasting. This so that he tastes the consequence of his act”. Koran V, 95. Malek has continued: “He who hunts, being in sanctification, then kills the hunted beast while he is in state of ihram, is comparable to someone who buys it in a state of ihram and then kills it. And Allah having forbidden this, the man must in these conditions repair this crime”. And he who then kills what he has hunted, while being in ihram, must be judged”. - Malek added: “this what I have heard best about the one who kills what he hunts is that he is judged by his title in such a way that he valorizes the hunted beast; one fixes what he owes to make eat with all poor of approximately one mudd, or to fast one day by compensation with each mudd. Then one determines the number of the poor if they are at ten, he must fast for ten days, at twenty he must fast for twenty days, as much therefore their number, even if it is at sixty poor. Malek finally said, “I have likewise heard that whoever kills game within the sacred precincts while it is being desacralized, will be judged. similarly to one who is in a state of ihram and kills game in the sacred enclosure”.

But the wild beasts which do not attack such: the hyena, the fox, the cat and animals similar to them, they are not not to be killed by a man while being from ihram. And if he kills them, he must expiate them. On the other hand, harmful birds are not to be killed by man in a state of ihram except those which have been mentioned by the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) such as: the crow and the hawk. And if it is done that the man in the state of ihram kills any other than these two kinds of birds, he must atone for it”.

Al-Fadl stared at her and she stared back at him; the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) caused Al-FadI's face to turn to the other side. The woman said, “Oh. Messenger of Allah, the prescription of Allah, in pilgrimage, is a difficult obligation for my father who has reached a certain age, and he can no longer maintain himself on the back of a mount. Can I perform the pilgrimage in his place? He replied: “Yes, certainly”. This happened during the Farewell Pilgrimage”. Chapter XXXI Of the pilgrim held back by the enemy.

Then we weren't informed, if the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had ordered one of his companions, nor any of those who were with him, to acquit sooner or later, nor to repeat any rite". 
(808) 103 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar, leaving for a pious visit to Mecca, during the conflict, (between al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf and Zubair ibn al-Awwam) said: "If I am going to be forbidden to come to the Holy House, I will do, what we have already done with the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah). Thus, he made the talbiat for a pious visit, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had made the talbiat for a pious visit in the year of Houdaibia”. Then Abdallah, thinking about what he has done. said: "The pilgrimage and the pious visit are both the same duty. Then addressing his companions he said to them: "Since both are the same duty, I take you to witness that I have given the order to bring together the pilgrimage and the visit pious”. Then he succeeded in gaining access to the Sacred House, completed the tawaf, finding that he had accomplished the rites, he sacrificed his victim”. Malek said: “such is this which is traditionally followed, by one who is restrained by an enemy, just like the case of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and his companions. As for the one who is retained in other conditions (or situations), he cannot be desacralized if he has not arrived at the Sacred House”. Chapter XXXII Of the Pilgrim retained by another cause than the enemy. 
(809) 104 Salem Ibn Abdallah reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: "The pilgrim detained because of an illness should not leave the ihram, before he made the processional tour around the Sacred House, and the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa.

I sent a messenger to Makkah where Abdallah Ibn Abbas, Abdallah Ibn Umar and others were consulting them about me. No one allowed me to leave ihram. So I stayed all near the water source for seven months (where I broke my thigh), until I was healed; so I left the ihram after having made a pious visit”. 
(812) 107 - Salem Ibn Abdallah reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "He who, having fallen ill, finds himself unable to arrive at the Sacred House, should never leave the ihram before he has completed the processional tour around the Sacred House, and traveled the route between “Al-Safa” and “Al-Marwa”. (....) 108 - Suleiman Ibn Yassar reported that Sa'id Ibn Huzaba Al-Makhzouni, becomes ill en route to Mecca, while being in ihram. He inquired about those who were near the water source, and met Abdallah Ibn Omar, Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair and Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam. Telling them what had happened to him, they all order him to remedy what he needs, and to make an offering. Once, feeling cured, he will have to make the pious visit then he will desacralize himself, waiting for the pilgrimage of the following year to accomplish it, and make the offering which seems easy to him». - Malek said: “this is what which is, for us, traditionally followed, for the one who is prevented, for another cause than that of the enemy. And Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, had ordered, Abu Ayoub Al-Ansari, and Habbar Ibn Al-Aswad, who missing the pilgrimage and arriving on the day of the sacrifice, to desacral themselves after a pious visit, then return home, still in a state of desacralization. Then, the following year, they will have to make the pilgrimage and offer their victims; in case they cannot be found for them, they will have to fast for three days while on pilgrimage, and for seven days once they are at home”. Malek added, “one who is in a state of ihram and who shall be inhibited from the pilgrimage either by reason of illness or other cause, or by error in counting the days, or by the invisibility of the crescent, being held as impeded, he shall discharge the same obligations as the pilgrim stop". Malek was asked about a Meccans who made the talbiat for a pilgrimage, then suffered a fracture, or diarrhea, or that his wife had to give birth, what would he do”? He says, “Whoever is subject to these conditions is already taken for granted. As a result, he will have to fulfill all the obligations that are applied to everyone”. Malek said: "for the man, who arrives, in the months of the pilgrimage, to make the pious visit, who once this is finished, he will make the talbiat of the pilgrimage from Mecca, then he suffers a fracture or something that prevents him from being at the same station with the other people", "I think, he said, he must persist until whatever it is restored, where he will go out to the free territory and then return to Mecca, make the processional tour around the Sacred House, and the route between Al-Safa and al-Marwa, after which he will go out of the state of ihram. He will have to make the pilgrimage the following year and will offer a victim”. Malek was asked about the one who does the talbiat for a pilgrimage from Mecca, then completes the processional tour around the Sacred House, and the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, after which he falls ill, and cannot manage to be at the same station with people”. Malek answered: "if this man has missed the pilgrimage, if he succeeds, he goes out to the free territory, will enter for a pious visitation, will make the processional tour around the Holy House and the route between al-Safa and al-Marwa, as his first tour was not for a pious visitation. For this, he must complete the rites mentioned, and will make the following year, the pilgrimage and the offering is to be sent. But if he is not one of the inhabitants of Mecca, and he suffers from an illness that keeps him away from the pilgrimage, he makes the processional tour around the House and the route between Al-Safa and Al- Marva. Then he is in a state of ihram for a pious visitation, made a processional tour around the House and the route between Al-Safa and al-Marwa, as his first tour and run was for pilgrimage only. The following year, he will have to do a pilgrimage and make an offering". Chapter XXXIII Of the construction of the Ka'ba.

Aisha replied, “O Messenger of Allah! Are you not going to rebuild it according to the foundations of Ibrahim”? He replied, "If your fellow citizens were not so close to the time of polythesis, I would have done it". Abdallah Ibn Omar added: “if Aicha had heard these words from the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) I do not think that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) would have neglected the fact of touch the two Yemenite columns that directly follow the Black Stone. But the House has not been restored according to the foundations of Ibrahim”.

He replied: "No, you should not do so, because it is the tradition followed, to make two raka'ts once the seven rounds are completed". - Malek said about of the man, who, distracted, will make eight or nine processional rounds, instead of seven, that he must break these rounds, if he is aware of the surplus, then make two raka'ts without taking into account the rounds made in addition. On the other hand, he does not have to consider the nine rounds already made after which he will make the prayer. Because he must do two raka'ts for every seven rounds completed. Malek added: “The one who doubts the number of his processional rounds, after having made two raka'ts, must start his rounds again to be sure of their exact number which is seven, then that he redo the two raka'ts, because any prayer made does not will be admitted only if the seven rounds have been completed”. -Malek finally said: "Whoever accidentally suffers, which may make him impure, while making his processional rounds around the House, or even during the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, or between these two rites, in such a way that his rounds are almost partially or totally accomplished, and that he has not yet done the two raka'ts, he must redo his ablutions, in order to continue his rounds and do his prayer.

When the prayer is finished, he will consider the number of rounds already made to complete them at seven. Then, he will not have to pray except just when the sun rises or sets”. And Malek has added: “and if he wants to delay the prayer after sunset, he can do so”. Malek finally said, “There is no harm in a man doing Tawaf after the dawn prayer, and the asr prayer provided he does not perform only seven rounds, and to delay the two raka'ts of the prayer, until the sun rises. Moreover, this is what Omar Ibn Al-Khattab did. He can delay them after the asr until sunset; the latter lying down, he can, if he wishes, pray to them, otherwise he can still delay them so that he can say the sunset prayer, and there is no harm in that”.

Allah will consider his pilgrimage accomplished. Malek finally said: "For the man who does not know that the last rite to perform is to walk around the House, and he is not aware that after leaving the holy places, I think he will not have nothing to do unless he is still very close to these places; then he must return to do the tour and then leave the Sacred House once the farewell tour has been completed”.

Then coming back to the House, and arriving at the door, I found myself impure again, so that I turned back and stayed at home until I was in purity; become pure, for the third time, here I am returning to the House, and again arrived at the door, the blood flowed.” which flows, is only the thrust of the demon.

He who makes the pilgrimage to the House or the pious visit does not commit of sin if he completes the ritual circuits here and there” Koran II, v.158. Thus, man is not to be judged if he does not make the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa”. Aicha replied: “No, you misunderstood this verse; for if it were so, it would have been revealed in the way following: "It will not be a subject of offense if the man does not make the journey between these two localities". Continuing, Aicha says: “So this verse was revealed about the Ansar who were doing the talbiat au, name of "Manat" (adored statue) located in front of Koudaid and they bothered to make the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. Being converted to Islam, they asked the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) about it.

And if he is unaware of this, and has already left Mecca, being far from this city, let him return there, perform the processional rounds around the House, and make the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. If he had had relations with his wife, let him turn back, make the tour around the House and the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa to complete what he had to accomplish with his pious visit, he will have to also make another pious visit the following year, and the sacrifice of an offering”.

Do not kill game when you are in a state of sacredness. Whoever among you intentionally kills any, will send to the Ka'ba, as compensation, an animal from his herd, equivalent to the game killed, according to the decision of two honest men among you. An equivalent reparation will still consist in feeding a poor person or in fasting” Koran V, 95. And of all that is considered as offerings of compensation, the sheep, is among what Allah has called offering. And this is indisputable, moreover, how can anyone doubt that? Any compensation that would not be a camel or a cow, should at least be a sheep; and if this compensation does not require a sheep, then one must redeem oneself by a fast or by the food of the poor”.

Abdallah Ibn Umar said to him: "For what has been cut from your hair, make an offering". A woman from Iraq asked him: “What should be his offering O Abou Abdel-Rahman”? He wondered, "His offering"?

So let them not discuss with you the order received, Call on your Lord! You are on a straight path”.

If he has done this, his pilgrimage will be admitted. But if he is not in the state of ihram before the appearance of the dawn, he will be just like the man who missed his pilgrimage.

Malek was asked: “What was the number of the raka'ts of the prayer made by the Meccans at Arafa? Two or four raka'ts? What did the prince of the pilgrimage do if he was a Meccans? Did he pray the noon and asr prayers to Arafa, four or two raka'ts? How was the prayer of the Meccans on the days of the pebble pier? He replied, “As long as the Meccans were in Arafa and Mina, they would perform a two-raka't prayer, shortening the prayer until they returned to Mecca; and he was the same for the prince of the pilgrimage, if he were a Meccans; he shortened the prayer in Arafa, and during the days of Mina. But if someone lived in Mina, or stayed there, he made a complete prayer. On the other hand, the one who lived in Arafa, or who lived there, he also made a prayer of four raka'ts”. Chapter LX VII The prayer of the one who dwells in Mecca and Mina 
(921) 217 - Malek said: "Whoever arrives in Mecca in the month of Zou-Hijja and makes the talbiat for a pilgrimage, must make a complete prayer until he leaves Mecca for Mina where he shortens the prayer. This is due to the fact that he decided to stay in the same locality for more than four nights”. Chapter LXVIII From Takbir the days of “Tachrik” 
(922) 218 - Reported to Yahia Ibn Sa'id that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, came out on the morning of the day of the sacrifice at the first ray of sunrise. He made the takbir and the people also did theirs. Then he came out again, the same day, while it was broad daylight, made the takbir, and the people did it the same way. Finally, he came out for the third time when the sun had disappeared, made the takbir and the people likewise did it, in such a way that this takbir being so high, he reaches Home. So we knew that Omar had come out to throw the stones. - Malek said, “What is traditional is that the takbir comes after the prayers. The first takbir is done by the imam and people accompany him after the midday prayer of the day of the sacrifice. As for the last, it is that of the imam in company of the faithful. This takbir is after the dawn prayer, on the last day of the “tachrik”, after which this takbir ceases”. - Malek added: "Takbir, should be done by men as well as women, on the days of the tachrik, whether you are in a group, or alone in Mina or elsewhere in any place. It is an obligation. And people to follow the imam of pilgrimage, and the people in Mina, because in case the latter return and leave the ihram, the others will be just like them, and will be desacralized. But he who does not make the pilgrimage, will not have to imitate them, making the takbir only during the days of the tachrik”. Malek said, "The days mentioned by Allah in the Quran are the days of the tachrik." Chapter LXIX From the prayer of "Al-Muzdalifa" and "Al-Muhassab" 
(923) 219 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) made kneel his mount to “Al-Batha” in Zoul-Houlaifa, and prayed. Nafe' added: "Abdallah Ibn Omar did the same". Malek said, “He is not allowed no one to pass through "Al-Mu'arass", returning from the pilgrimage, without praying there. And if he is passing through, and it is not time to pray, let him stay there waiting for the moment of prayer. He will be able to make, thereafter, other prayers than those which are supererogatory, because it was reported to me that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had made a prayer to Al-Mou'arass and it was the same for Abdallah Ibn Omar who had stopped there». 
(924) 220 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar performed the midday, Asr, sunset and evening prayers at Al-Muhassab; then he entered, at night in Mecca, making the processional rounds around the House”. Chapter LXX From spending the nights of Mina in Mecca.

And Malek added: "If they were a little bigger, it would be better for me." (....) 228 - Nafe reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "Whoever found in Mina on the second day of the tachrik, and when the sun sets, let him not leave this place until he has thrown the pebbles of the next day". 
(932) 229 - Abdel Rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported that his father said: “Once people threw the pebbles, on the jamarates, they were back and forth, walking; as for Mou'awia Ibn Abi Soufian, he was the first to do the course, while being on his mount”. 
(933) 230 - Malek a reported that he asked Abdel-Rahman Ibn Al Kassem: "From what distance Al-Kassem threw the stones at the Jamarate of Al-Aqaba"? He replied, "From a suitable place." Yahia reported that we have asked Malek: "Can we throw the pebbles by substitution for children and the sick"? He replied, "Yes, but let the patient find out when the pebbles were thrown at him by substitution, so that he could do the takbir while being at home, and that he slaughters his offering. And if the patient is cured during the days of the tachrik, he throws the same number of pebbles, which were thrown for him, and he will obligatorily make an offering». Malek added: "I don't do not see that the one who throws the stones, or makes the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, while not having his ablutions, that he must redo the rites, but that this is not done on purpose". 
(934) 231 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: "Not to throw the stones, the three days of the tachrik, before the sun has left the meridian". Chapter LXXII Of the tolerance permitted for Jamarate rummy.

(936) 233 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Ata Ibn Yassar say that it was tolerated for herdsmen to throw stones at night. He added: “It dates back to the earliest era of Islam”. Malek said: “Interpreting the hadith where the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had tolerated the herdsmen of delay the throwing of the stones, I think, and Allah is Most knowledgeable about this, which he had implied, the throwing of the stones on the day of the sacrifice, then the day after it, and the day when one prepares to leave the holy places, in such a way that they will throw away what they had to throw away the day before, and the present day, because no one can abstain from his obligations; but if he misses them he must pay for them. If they (the shepherds) realize that they have finished throwing stones, in two days, and that they are residents of Mina, on the third day, they will throw with the others, leaving the place with them”. 
(937) 234 - Nafe’a reported from her father, that a daughter of Safia Bint Abi Obaid's brother gave birth to Muzdalifa. For this, she and Safia, were late (compared to the other pilgrims) and had arrived in Mina only after sunset. Abdallah Ibn Omar ordered them to throw the stones as soon as they arrived, and found no other obligations for them”. Yahia reported that we have asked Malek about the one who forgot to throw the pebbles at one of the Jamarates (three in number) and only remembered in the evening”? Malek replied, “Let him throw them away when he remembers day or night, just as he fulfills a prayer he forgot to say, day or night. If he remembers, after having left Mina, and is already in Mecca, or even left this city, he must make an offering". Chapter LXXHI Tawaf al-Ifada. 
(938) 235 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab made the khutba on the day of Arafa, and taught the rites of pilgrimage to the faithful. Of which said to them, "Once you come to Mina, those who threw the stones at the Jamarates, they will be tolerated whatever they were forbidden to make pilgrimage, except to approach women and put on some perfume. Let no one touch the women, nor wear perfume before he has made the farewell rounds around the House”. 
(939) 236 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "He who threw the stones, then shaved his head or cut his hair, then slew his offering, he will be permitted everything that was forbidden to him except women and perfume, from the moment that he has not yet completed the farewell rounds around the House”. Chapter LXXIV From Tawaf al-Ifada of a woman having her period 
(940) 237 Aisha, the mother of believers reported: "we left, the year of the farewell pilgrimage, with the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and made the talbiat for a pious visit. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to the faithful: "Whoever has his offering, let him make the talbiat for a pilgrimage with a pious visitation, then he does not leave the ihram before having completed all the rites”. Safia added, “I arrived in Makkah having my period; thus I could neither make the processional rounds around the House, nor the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. I complained to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said to me: "Untie your hair, and comb it, then make the talbiat for the pilgrimage, leaving aside the pious visit". She continued: “I have accomplished everything. Then ending the pilgrimage, the Envoy of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) sent me with Abdel-Rahman Ibn Abi Bakr Al-Siddiq to Al-Tan'im, where I made the talbiat for a pious visit ". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) then said to me: "Such is the place, where you will begin your pious visit». Thus, those who had already done the talbiat for a pious visit, made the processional rounds around the House and the race, between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, then put themselves in a state of desacralization. Then they made a farewell tour, once they were back from Mina, for their pilgrimage. As for those who had done the talbiat for a pilgrimage or for a joint pilgrimage and pious visit, they made only one round”. (....) 238 - Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair reported from Aicha, the same hadith». 
(941) 239 - Aicha reported: “I came to Makkah, and I had my period; so I did neither the processional rounds around the House, nor the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. So, I complained about this to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), he said to me: "Do the rites just like a pilgrim, but without making the processional rounds around the House, nor the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, until you are in a state of purity”. About the woman who does the talbiat for a pious visit, then who enters Mecca at the time of the pilgrimage, while she is having her period, Malek said: “She cannot make the processional rounds around the House; and if she fears not to be in purity, let her do the talbiat for a pilgrimage, and that she brings an offering. In this case, she is like one who has joined a pilgrimage and a pious visitation at the same time, and a single processional tour is sufficient for her. The woman who has her menses, if she had already made the rounds around the House, and had prayed, she will be able to make the course between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, also the station at Arafa and Muzdalifa, and will finally throw the pebbles. However, she will not be able to break out to do Tawaf el Ifada before she is purified of her menses. Chapter 75 The Tawaf el Ifada the surge of the woman who has her period. 
(942) 240 - Aicha, the mother of believers reported that Safia daughter of Houaia had her period. She was going to say this to the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who exclaimed: "Will she, we hold here,”? They tell her she's already done her rounds processional (tawaf al-ifada), he retorted: "So she did not detain us." 
(943) 241 - Aisha, the mother of believers reported that she said to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah): “O Messenger of Allah! Safia, Houaia's daughter, had her period. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) exclaimed: "It may be that she keeps us around the House". He was answered, "Yes"; then he replied; "You are free to go." 
(944) 242 - Amrah Bint Abdel-Rahman, reported that when Aicha, the mother of the believers, made the pilgrimage with other women who were in danger of having their periods, she asked them to make the departure tour on the day of the sacrifice. So, if they had had their period after that, Aicha did not have to wait for them until they were purified to make the rounds and leave”. 
(945) 243 - Aisha, the mother of believers, reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) asked about Safia bint Houaia”. Answering her that she had her period, he exclaimed: “Is she going to keep us here”? He was answered: “O Messenger of Allah she has already made the rounds around the House”. Thus, he replied, "So, no." Malek said: “Hicham, Urwa and Aisha had reported the same hadith. And the men never pushed their wives to continue the rites of pilgrimage, especially since it will not be useful to them. And if the men, on the other hand, reacted differently, more than six thousand menstruating women would have come to Mina, all of whom had already completed their farewell rounds around the House”. 
(946) 244 - Abu Salama Ibn Abdel-Rahman reported that Umm Sulaim Bint Milham asked for the opinion of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), for having had his period, or for having given birth, and that after having completed the tour on the day of the sacrifice”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) allowed him to go. Malek said: "for the woman who has her period in Mina, she must stay there, until she makes the rounds around the House, which is an obligation to her. But if she had already made the rounds, before having her period, she can go home. This is what the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had allowed, to the woman who has her menses”. Malek added: “If the woman has her period in Mina, even before making the farewell tour, her distress at being impure holds her back much more than menses usually holds a woman back". ChapterLXXVl Of the expiation of the crime of hunting a bird or a beast. 
(947) 245 - Abu Al-Zoubair reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab required the offense of hunting (on the pilgrimage) to be the following: “for a hyena, a ram; for a gazelle, a goat; for a rabbit, a goat (a few months, not even a year); for a jerboa a goat (precisely four months old). 
(948) 246 - Muhammad Ibn Sirin reported that a man came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, and said to him: "I was with a companion, in a horse race, to gain access to the opening of a defile, when we rushed a deer , while we were in the state of ihram. What do you suggest about it? Omar, turning to a man who was close to him, said: "Come, let us both judge, so--that we can pass sentence." They demanded, in compensation, a goat from the deer killed. The man left saying: "There is the prince of the believers, who could not advance a sentence about a deer, only by summoning another judge to support him". Hearing this, Omar called the man and asked: "Are you reciting Surah 'al-Ma'ida'? The man replied, "No." Omar continued: “Do you know this man who supported me in my judgment? "No; he replied. Omar continued: "If you had told me, that you were reciting the surah " al-Ma'ida", I would have hit you terribly; Allah Most High said in his Book (meaning): "...Which will be judged by two of yours, people of integrity, and it will be like an offering sent to the Ka'ba". Koran V, 95. This man who issued the judgment is Abul-Rahman Ibn Auf”. 
(949) 247 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father said, "For a wild ox killed, a compensation of a cow, and for an antelope, a sheep." 
(950) 248 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id, reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: "For a pigeon of Mecca, killed, the offering is of a sheep." About a man, who is a Meccans, being in ihram for a pilgrimage or a pious visit, having pigeons in his house, which died, because they were locked up, Malek said: “I think that 'he must expiate them, by advancing the offering of a sheep for each pigeon'. 
(951) 249 - Malek said, "I keep hearing, that for every ostrich killed, by a man in ihram, he owes as compensation a camel or a cow." Malek added: “For the egg of an ostrich, I foresee the compensation of by the tenth of the price of a camel or a cow in comparison with a free woman whose belly contains, a son or a daughter, each estimated at fifty dinars, which is equivalent to a tenth of the price of his mother's blood. As for the birds of prey such as the eagle, the osprey, the falcon, if they are killed by a man in ihram they must be expiated like other game. This expiation of the small and the great is like the price of the blood of a child and a great, because they are on an equal footing”. Chapter LXXVII Of the atonement, of him who in state of ihram, kills locusts. 
(952) 250 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that a man came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, saying to him: "O Prince of the Believers, I have killed, with my whip, while being in ihram, locusts”. He replied, "Go give the poor a handful of food." 
(953) 251 - Yahia reported that a man came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, asking his advice, for killing locusts, while he was in ihram”. Omar addressing Ka'b said to him: "Come, let this case be judged". Ka'b said, "He owes a dirham"; Omar, not appreciating Ka'b's opinion, said to him: "You are thinking of the dirhams, as for me, a date is better than a grasshopper". Chapter LXXVIII Of the expiation of him who shaves himself before slaughtering his offering. 
(954) 252 - Ka'b Ibn Ujra reported that he was in the company of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), in ihram. Head lice, hurt him, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) permitted him to shave his head, saying: "You shall fast for three days, or you shall feed six poor, each having a share of two mudas, or you will cut the throat of a sheep; whatever the act to be done, it will be an expiation”. 
(955) 253 - Ka'b Ibn Ujra reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "It is probable that these insects cause you harm. I replied, "Yes, O Messenger of Allah." He replies: “Go shave your head and then fast for three days, or feed six poor people or sacrifice a sheep”. 
(956) 254 - Ata Ibn Abdallah Al-Khourassani reported: "I was at the market in "Al-Bouram" in Kufa, an old man reported to me that Ka'b Ibn Oujra told him the following: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) came to find me, while I was rekindling the fire over a pot, for my companions. The lice swarmed in my head and beard. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), r took me from my forehead and said to me: "Go and shave that hair, and fast for three days, or feed six poor people". And the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) knew that I did not have a victim to immolate”. Malek said: “For the Redemption of the crime, it consists in the fact that no one must redeem himself before he has accomplished, which requires a redemption. As for reparation, it is a duty only when the subject is obliged to pay it; and he can make atonement wherever he wishes, in Mecca or elsewhere, opting either for sacrifice, fasting or almsgiving”. Malek added: “One who is in ihram, cannot pluck his hair, shave it or shorten it, before he leaves ihram. But if he suffers a disease in his head, (in his hair), he must, as Allah has commanded, redeem himself. He cannot cut his nails, nor kill lice, nor remove them from his head and throw them on the ground, nor get rid of lice from his skin or his clothes. If the one who is in ihram gets rid of these insects, let him eat a handful of food”. Malek finally said: “He who depilates his nose or armpits, or covers his body with depilatory products, or shaves his head out of necessity because of a wound, or shaves his neck for a bloodletting when he is in ihram, and that by forgetting or by ignorance, he must, by compensation, redeem himself. He must not shave his head to perform a bloodletting; therefore, whoever, by forgetfulness, shaves his head before throwing the pebbles, he owes redemption». Chapter LXXIX What we must do in case one forgets a rite. 
(957) 255 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas said: “Whoever forgets or neglects one of the rites must sacrifice an animal”. Ayoub added: “I don't know, it says: 'neglected or forgotten'. Malek said, "If it's a sacrifice to be made, he must make it only in Mecca. On the other hand, if it is a compensation, he can do it where he wishes. Chapter LXXX Of various forms of "fidya" redemption. 
(958) 256 - For the one who, while being in ihram, wants to put on clothes, which are not his allowed since it is in ihram, or even cuts his hair, or even wears perfume without any necessity, for the simple reason that it is easy for him to redeem himself, Malek said: "It is not becoming for anyone to do this, unless it is is a necessity, and even then he must redeem himself. Malek was questioned for the question of redemption, fasting or almsgiving or sacrifice, will its author have to choose? What will be the sacrifice? What will be the amount of the food? What mod should I use? How many days will the fast be? Can we postpone this redemption, or will we have to pay at the same time? He replied, “Everything in the Book of Allah concerning redemption is found in such and such a form. And its author has the choice to do what he sees fit. As for the sacrifice, it is one sheep; the fast is three days, the food is to be given for six poor people, each having the share of two mudds, according to the mudd envisaged by the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah). Malek added, “I heard a few men versed in religion say, 'a man in ihram, aiming at something, kills game unintentionally, he must redeem himself. It is the same for one who has left ihram, if he aims at something inside the enclosure, and he kills game without wanting to, he must redeem himself, because what is premeditated and what is erroneous are in this case on the same footing. .. About a group of men, who, all in ihram or in the sacred precinct, kill a game animal, Malek said, “I foresee, that each of them, must redeem himself: if it be a sacrifice assigned to them, each must advance an offering; If it's a fast imposed on them, each of them must fast. It is the same for men who by mistake kill an individual. In this case, the expiation of this homicidal act will be the liberation of a slave, and this on the part of of each of them, or that each fast for the following two months". Malek said, "He who kills game, or kills it, after throwing the stones and having shaved his head, when he had not yet made the farewell round, he has to expiate this offense of hunting, because Allah Blessed and Most High said: “Hunt when you have returned to the profane state”. Koran V, 2. On the other hand, the one who has not yet made the tour (tawaf), what is forbidden to him are women and perfume”. Malek also said: "He who is in the state of ihram, will have nothing as redemption, for having cut down the trees of the sacred enclosure; and nothing has come to us about it, and it is wrong what he has done”. Malek finally said: “at the about one who, ignorant or forgetting to fast for three days during the pilgrimage, or because of illness, does not fast them until he has returned home", he must make an offering, if he find, where let him fast three days when he is at home, and seven more days thereafter”. ChapterLXXXI The rules followed during the pilgrimage. 
(959) 257 - Abdallah Ibn Amr Ibn Al'-As reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) stood, in the middle people in Mina who were asking him various questions, a man came and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! Involuntarily, I shaved before sacrificing”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: "Immole, there is no harm in that". Another said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! Involuntarily, I immolated before throwing the stones”. He replied: "Throw away (the pebbles) and don't worry about it". For any question asked to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) concerning the anteriority of a rite performed, or its posteriority, his only answer was only: "Do such a thing, without any harm".

Kingship and praise belong to Him, He is mighty over all thing. We return to Him, we repent to Him, we bow down to Him, we praise Him.

(962) 260 - Talha Ibn Oubaidallah Ibn Kariz reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “In no day will Satan was not seen more humiliated, more despised, more reproached and more wrathful than he was on the day of Arafa. And it is as such, only because that he is a witness of the descent of mercy, and of the forgiveness which Allah has bestowed upon great sins, except that which he saw on the day of Badr”. It was asked, “What did he see on the day of Badr, O Messenger of Allah”? He replied, "He did indeed see Gabriel lining up the angels." 
(963) 261 - Talha Ibn Ubaidallah Ibn Kariz reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "the best invocation, is that which is made on the day of Arafa, and the best words that my predecessors of the Prophets and I have spoken are: "There is no god but Allah, He has no partner". 
(964) 262 - Anas Ibn Malek reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) entered Mecca in the year of the conquest of this city, covering his head with an iron helmet. Being, thus a man came and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! Ibn Khatal clings to the veils of the Ka'ba”. He replied, "Kill him." Malek said, interpreting this hadith: “The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was not at that time there in ihram, and it is Allah who is most informed about this. 
(965) 263 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar, coming from Makkah; on his arrival at “Al-Koudaid”, he was made aware of a disturbance which upset Medina, he turned back and returned to Mecca, leaving the ihram”. (...) 264 - Malek said: "That Ibn Chehab related the same hadith". 
(966) 265 - Imran Al-Ansari reported: “Abdallah Ibn Omar came to join me, while I was resting under a thick tree, on the road to Makkah. He said to me: “What prompted you to rest under the shade of this tree”? I replied, "I wanted to be protected." He replied, "Is there another reason"? I replied, "No, just that."

The man replied, "I am going to Mecca for the pilgrimage." Abu Zarr replied: “Will you have anything else to do”? "No-answered the man"; So, go on your way, suggested Abou-Zarr. The man continuing to narrate says: “Thus, I left, from Abou Zarr, destination Mecca; come, I stayed there as Allah willed; suddenly I saw people surrounding a man, pressing him from all sides; so I exhausted myself in order to approach this man; it was the old man I had met at Al-Rabaza- implying Abou Zarr seeing me, he recognized me”.

Thus, let her keep women company, so that she accomplishes her pilgrimage”.

He who is of reward is considered such, because his owner has dedicated him to fight in the way of Allah, he has bound him, stretching the rope in a meadow or an orchard so that he grazes the grass. And all that is grazed will be counted as good deeds for that man who owns the horse. If it is done that this horse is detached from its cord, and that it goes away while crossing at the gallops two or three stages, its traces and its excrements are counted of them of good actions for this man owner. If it happens, that, this horse, passes close to a river, drinks without its owner wanting it, that will be counted to him as good deeds and will be rewarded for it. The horse which is a protection, is the one whose owner uses it for his subsistence, without begging from others, and without even forgetting the right of Allah on their necks and on their backs. As for the burdened horse, its owner tied it up out of vanity, ostentation and out of aversion against Muslims". We asked the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) about the donkeys, he replied: “Nothing was revealed to me about them, except this general verse and isolated: "Whoever weighs an atom of well, will see.

He went out to talk with Yazid Ibn Abi Sufian and the latter was in this time there, governor of one of its regions. It was claimed that Yazid had said to Abu Bakr: "Either you go up or I go down (We want to hear that Abu Bakr went on foot, as for Yazid, he was at horse). Abu Bakr replied: "Neither for you to descend, nor for me to ascend, for I am willing to deserve the reward for my steps in the path of Allah”. Then he said to him: “You will see people who have devoted themselves to Allah (The monks), leave them and the one to whom they have devoted themselves. You will see people who have shaved the top of their head (Deacons), strike them down by striking the top of their head”. And I recommend ten things to you: “Not to kill a woman, nor a child, nor an old man, not to cut down a fruit tree, nor destroy what is built; not to slaughter a sheep or a camel unless they are to eat; not to set the bees on fire and not to scatter them; not to cheat and not to be cowardly”. . 
(983) 11 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz wrote to one of his prefects: “We were told that if the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa sallam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) sent a troop of men, he would say to them: “Make the expedition in the name of 'Allah and strive in the way of Allah you will bring down those who disbelieve in Allah; do not cheat, do not betray, do not disfigure your victims and do not kill children”. Transmit this to your army and your troops if it pleases Allah. May the peace be with you". Chapter IV Compliance with the security promise. 
(984) 12 - Malek reported from a man from Kufa, whom Omar Ibn Al-Khattab wrote to the leader of a troop, sent on a mission: "I have been told that men among you are hunting the unbeliever while the latter has taken refuge on the top of a mountain, a man among you said to him: "Come down and do not be afraid" and when he was close to it, the man killed him by treachery. He who holds my soul in His hand! If I knew where the one who did this was, I would have to cut off his head”. Yahia said, "I heard Malek say, 'This hadith was not recognized by the scholars, and one does not put into execution (the words of Omar namely) cut off his head”. Malek was asked about the security pledge, is it verbal'? He replied, "Yes, I see that she perhaps a sign of the hand, such as one advances to the troops and says: "Do not kill someone to whom you have promised safety, because for me, a sign made with the hand is equivalent to a word”. I was told that Abdallah Ibn al-Abbas said: "The people who betray the promise, .Allah will give victory to his enemy”. Chapter V From giving something in the way of Allah.

Malek was asked about a man who decided to make an expedition, and who prepared; when he wanted to leave, his parents or one of them prevented him from doing so”. He replied, “Let him not irritate them, but postpone his expedition for the following year. As for his equipment (his weapons) he keeps it to use when he needs it. And if he risks that what he has is no longer usable, he can sell it in order to to have the price, with which he will buy what to use for the next expedition. If he is well off, he can get the same equipment for his next expedition, where he can enjoy it as he sees fit. Chapter VI From assembling loot during an expedition. 
(987) 15 -Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) sent a troop where Abdallah Ibn Omar was a member, on the side of Najd. They procured a large herd of camels where each had a share of twelve or eleven camels. And for booty an extra camel. 
(988) 16 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab say: "During an expedition, in case the men divided their spoils, they estimated the camel at ten sheep". About the slave present in an expedition Malek said, “If he witnesses the battle, and takes part in it with the men, if he is free, he will have his share of the spoils; if he is not, and he does not participate in the fight, he is not entitled to anything. I even think that the booty is only on the part of the one who, a free man, participated in the fight. ChapterVII Of what is not subject to the fifth."al qoums" Malek said: “For the enemies who, landing in a Muslim-owned territory, and claiming to have been thrown from the sea to the shores, whereas the Muslims have no assurance on this subject except the broken boats for evidence, or else being thirsty, they disembarked without the Muslims allowing them! It is for the Governor to judge of them, and I do not think it is lawful for him who has taken them for captives, to share in the fifth (of the booty). Chapter VIII Of what Muslims are permitted to eat before the levy of the quint. Malek said: “I think there is no harm in this that the Muslims having conquered the enemy territory, that they eat of their food before the booty is subjected to the division”. Malek continues: “I think camels, cows and sheep are esteemed as food, which Muslims can eat, if they are in enemy territory. If the flesh of these animals must not be eaten before people attend the sharing of the spoils where everyone will have his share, this can upset the combatants. Thus, I find no harm in eating in order to subsist, and that it is without excess. But, what I disavow, is that someone makes a provision to bring it to his family”. Malek was asked about the fighter who procures food from enemy territory. He eats it, stocks up, and he has some left over. Is he allowed to keep this leftover, either that he wants to bring it to eat with his family, or that he intends to sell it before returning home, to take advantage of the price? Malek replied, "If he sells that remnant and it's still shipping, I think that price needs to be added to the loot of the Muslims; but, if it is done that he is in his country, and that this remainder is on him, I see no harm in him eating it with his family, and that he benefits, even if this remainder is not of a certain value”. Chapter IX Of handing over to the owner what the enemies have procured. 
(989) 17 - Yahia, reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Omar, had during an expedition, lost a maroon slave, and a horse which had fled, which fell into the hands of the enemy. The Muslims having recovered them, they returned them to Abdallah Ibn Omar, before they were counted as booty”. , Yahia continued: I heard Malek say about goods won by the enemy, from the Muslims: “If their owners succeed in taking them back before the spoils are divided, these goods are their rights; but if the sharing of the loot has already taken place, they will no longer have the right to obtain them again. Malek was asked about a man whose slave was taken captive by the enemy, then recaptured by the Muslims. “Malek said, “His master has the primacy of having it without paying any price, value, or fine, unless it is counted as booty. Now, if it is, I think it should be handed over to its master for a price, if he wants it”. Malek was asked about a slave whose the child is of a Muslim man; taken captive by the enemy and recovered by the Muslims, she is considered booty, after which her master recognized her by taking an oath. Malek said, “She is not to be taken as a slave, and I think the imam should pay her ransom on behalf of her master. If the imam will not act like this, it is up to his master to pay his ransom and not to neglect it. And if it is of belonging to another than its master by part of spoils - I don't think it's his right to take her into slavery, nor to allow herself to live with her, because she has the same title as a free woman. Being told that his master must pay his ransom, if this woman is injured, the two cases are the same. Thus, he does not have to deliver the mother of his child, to slavery, nor to be cohabited”. Malek was asked about the man leaving for enemy territory to free the prisoners in paying a ransom, or for trade, buying the free and the slave or offering them to him as a gift. Malek replied, “Thus, for the free man, his price is a debt to be paid later, for he is not to be considered a slave. And if it is a gift received, it is free, and nothing is indebted to its title, except if the first man gave a reward in exchange in order to have it; in this case, this is a debt that the liberated man will have to pay, at the price of his freedom. As for the slave, his first master will have to choose: either that he take him back by paying the price to the one who bought him to free him, or that he take him back. book, if desired. If this slave is a gift, he can take it back without any obligation on the part of his master; but if the man has already paid a ransom on his title to free him, in this case this ransom is a debt that the master will have to pay, if he wants to take him back”. Chapter X Spoils of the enemy as booty. 
(990) 18 - Abu Katada Ibn Rib'i reported the following: "We went out with the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam),r the year of Hounain. The Muslims entered into fierce combat with the enemy. I saw one of the enemies about to kill a Muslim. I turned to him and attacked him from behind kicking him. saber on the carotid. He faced me and squeezed me in a way that I was going to smell dead then let go of me and fell dead. I met Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, he said to me: "What have men got?" I answered him: “It is the order of Allah”. The men returned, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to them: “Whoever has killed an enemy, by proving this, he will have his remains. Then I stood up and said, "Who can be my witness"? Then I sit down. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) resumed his question: "He who has killed an enemy, by proving this, he will have his spoils”. Again I stood up to say, "Who can be my witness"? Then I sit down. Finally for the third time, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), r took up the same question; getting up, he said to me: “What is the matter with you, O Abu Katada”? I told him the scene, a man got up and said: "It's true, O Messenger of Allah, and the remains of the dead are with me. So let him be satisfied with his right to it”. Abu Bakr stood up and said to the man, “No! By Allah! The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) will not harm one of the lions of Allah who fought for Allah and his Messenger, may he give you his spoils". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) then exclaimed: "Abu Bakr has spoken the truth" then addressing the man, he said to him: "Give him these remains”. The man gave me the remains and by selling the cuirass, I bought myself with its price a garden at Bani Salama; and such was the first good that I have benefited from Islam”. 
(991) 19 Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that he heard a man questioning Abdallah Ibn Abbas about the loot? Ibn Abbas replied, "The horse is booty, as well as the spoils." The man asked the same question again and received the same answer from Ibn Abbas. The man asked, for the third time, "What is the spoil mentioned by Allah in His Book"? Al-Kassem said: "And the man kept asking for Ibn Abbas to the point of embarrassing him, when the latter exclaimed: “Do you know who this man is like? It is similar to “Sabigh” that Omar Ibn Al Khattab hit. Malek was asked about a man who killed a enemy, if he can benefit from his remains without the imam's permission? He answered: "He cannot profit from it without the permission of the imam, and the latter can only decide according to his own lights. I have not been told that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa sallam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Let him who killed a enemy seizes his spoils", except on the day of Hounain". Chapter XI Exceptional shares of one-fifth of the loot. ."al qoums" 
(992) 20 - Sa'id Ibn al-Musaiab said: "We gave the men exceptional shares of one-fifth of the booty". Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." Malek was asked about the shares exceptional, could they be held from the first loot obtained? He replied, “It comes down to the Imam and his jurisprudence, and what is followed in Medina, cannot be done without the jurisprudence of the Sultan. On the other hand, I have not been told that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had acted in this way in all his expeditions except the day of Hounain. Everything comes back to the imam's jurisprudence about the first loot obtained and the others after”. Chapter XII The shares of the riders during the expeditions. 
(993) 21 - Malek reported: “I was made know that Omar Ibn Abdel Aziz said: "For the horseman, the right is in two parts, and one part for the infantryman"? Malek added, “And we keep following this principle". Malek was asked about a man who has many horses in battle; will these horses all be shares to be shared”? He answered: I have nothing about it; and I think we shouldn't give him only the proper share of the horse he has mounted to fight". Malek said: "Beasts of burden and horses of a pure Arab race, are only horses, for Allah Blessed and Most High has said: “He created for you horses, mules, and donkeys, for you to ride them and for display” Koran XVI, 8. He also said: “Prepare to fight against them, all you find, forces and cavalry, in order to frighten the enemy of Allah and yours”. Koran VIII, 60. I think, said Malek, that these kinds of beasts, namely pack animals, are horses which the governor allows to be ridden”. Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: "We asked Malek, if we owe zakat for beasts of burden"? He replied: “Should we owe zakat for horses”? (Since the latter do not require zakat, so will pack animals. Chapter XIII Booty Fraud. 
(994) 22 - Amr Ibn Chou'aib reported: "When the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) returned from Hunain, in heading towards Al-Jourana, the men asked him (to give them some booty) and ended up cornering him to a thorny shrub which tore the coat and slipped off his back. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to them: "Give me back my name coat, are you afraid that I will not share with you what Allah has given me as a spoil? By him who holds my soul in his hand! If Allah had granted me benefits as much as the trees of Tihama (lit. samura, kind of long tree) I would have shared them with you. You will not find me miserly, cowardly or a liar”. When the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) descended, (from his mount), he stood among the men and said to them: “Give back the thread and the needle, for fraud is but an infamy, what fire and shame for its author on the day of resurrection”. Then he picked up a camel's hair, or something similar, from the ground and continued: "By him who holds my soul in his hand, if Allah had given such a thing to you and to me, I would not delay not to distribute to you, even the fifth which belongs to me".

He said: "The men of this tribe found in the packsaddle of a mount which belonged to one of them, a necklace of black and white grains that he had defrauded of the booty.

The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), ordered the men to go to Wadi-Al-Qoura. When they were there while Mid'am was laying down the saddle of the camel of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) he was hit by an arrow by chance, which killed him". The men exclaimed, "What a happy fate, let him be in Paradise". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: “No! By him who holds my soul in his hand! the "chemia" (wide cloth in the form of a cloak) which he had taken from the spoil on the day of Khaibar before it was divided shall burn it in the fire". Learner this, a man among the people brought one or two laces of sandals and gave them to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said: "One or two laces of fire".

If I am killed fighting in the way of Allah, resigning myself and hoping to be rewarded, always going forward without ever retreating. Will Allah forgive me for my sins? He replied, "Yes." The man left, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) called him or ordered him to be called and said to him: “What did you just say”; the man resumed his words; The Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) then replied: "Yes, except for the debt, and it was Gabriel who came to tell me."

Thus the coward flees his father and his mother, and the daring will fight without considering too much what he can bring back home. Killing is a means of death. The martyr is the one who gives himself for Allah, hoping to obtain the reward”. Chapter XVI From the wash of the martyr. 
(1008) 36 Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab was washed, buried, and the funeral prayer was made over him when he was a martyr. May Allah have mercy on him”.

Malek said, "And this sunnah is to be applied on those who died in the field of battle, and who were not helped to the point of death”. And Malek added: “As for the one we get to save and care for, and who continues to live as long as Allah wills, he will be washed, and the funeral prayer will be offered to him, just as it was done for Omar Ibn Al-Khattab”.

He said to me: “Men from my community, were presented to me (in a dream), fighting in the way of Allah; they took to the open sea, kings on their thrones, or like kings on their thrones (the reporter suspects the accuracy)”. I said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! Call on Allah to be among them; he called on Allah for her, then he laid his head down and fell asleep. And then he woke up, laughing. She said, “I asked her, “O Messenger of Allah! What are you laughing at"? He replied: “People from my community were presented to me (in a dream) during an expedition in the way of Allah. They are kings on their thrones or like kings on their thrones, repeating the same words”. I said to him: "O Messenger of Allah invoke Allah for me so that I may be one of them". He answered: “You are among the first”. The rapporteur added: "She sailed, at the time when Mou'awia governed; and on disembarking she fell from her mount and was killed”. 
(1012) 40 Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "If I were not afraid, trouble my community, I would have liked never to miss a troop of men leaving for an expedition in the way of Allah. Corn I can't always have mounts to put at their disposal, so that they can accomplish their mission. On the other hand, they won't be able to bear, stay behind me. So, I would like to fight in the way of Allah, and be killed, then come back to life, then be killed again, and finally come back to life again, and be killed”. 
(1013) 41 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported: “When it was the day of Ouhod, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) addressing the faithful, said: "Who can bring me news of Sa'd Ibn Al-Rabi' Al-Ansari"? A man replied, "I, O Messenger of Allah." The man left, searching among the slain. Sa'd Ibn Al Rabi' asked him: "What do you want"? The man replied, “The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has instructed me to bring him news of you”. Sa'd replied, “Return to him, convey my greetings to him, and tell him that I received twelve spear thrusts which could cause my death, but I was saved. Report to your fellow citizens, that they will never be apologized to Allah, if the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) is killed, and one of you will remain living".

(1015) 43 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Mu'az Ibn Jabal said: "There are two kinds of expedition: One where precious goods are spent, where one treats the companion with mercy, where one obeys the one who has power, and where one avoids evil; this expedition brings only good. The other is an expedition where one does not spend goods, where one treats the companion rudely, where one does not obey the one who holds power, and where one does not avoid the perversity. Such an expedition does not bring any good to whoever participates in it. Chapter XIX About horses, horse racing and the expense of expeditions. 
(1016) 44 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “Good will be tied to the forelocks of horses until the day of resurrection”.

And Abdallah Ibn Omar had again participated in this race. 
(1018) 46 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab say: “There is no harm in betting on horses, if there is a certain prize to be received in case one wins a race. In case of loss, nothing has to be paid. (That is to say, there is not a bet to advance, but a prize that the winner must have). 
(1019) 47 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) was seen wiping the head of his horse of his coat. When asked to explain this, he replied, "I was reproached last night for having neglected the horses." 
(1020) 48 - Anas Ibn Malek reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r Upon him the grace and peace of Allah left for the expedition of Khaibar, he arrived there at night. And usually, if he arrived at the place of the expedition at night, he did not attack until the morning. The Jews of Khaibar came out with their shovels and baskets, seeing him, they cried, “Muhammad! by Allah! It is Muhammad and his “Khamis” (his army). So, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) said: “Allah is Great Khaibar is ruined. When we descend into the people's place, what a disastrous revival will it be for those who have been warned. 
(1021) 49 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever wears two pairs (of his possessions) in the way of Allah, it will be said to him in Paradise: “O servant of Allah, this is good”; he who is of those who perform prayer, he shall be called from the gate of prayer; he who is of those who participated in the battles, he will be called from the gate of the battle; whoever is of those who have given alms, shall be called from the door of almsgiving; he who is of those who have fasted, he will be called from the door called: “Al-Rayan”. Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq then said: “O Messenger of Allah, whoever is called by one of these doors will therefore no longer have to perplex; will there be a few who will be called through all these doors”? He replied, "Surely, yes, and I hope you are one of them”. Chapter XX Of the recovery, by the People of the Book who follow Islam, of their territory. Malek was asked about the imam, who accepts the tax, which the people (of the Book) paid. How do you treat those who have followed Islam, are they entitled to their territories, or will they be for the Muslims, as well as their territories, or will they be for Muslims, as well as their possessions. Malek replied: “This is to be discussed: thus, those who have signed a peace pact, and having followed Islam, will have the right to their territories and the goods they possessed; but those who were defeated by force, will not be entitled to their territories, nor to the possessions even if they will follow Islam, because they fought against the Muslims, and confronted them; consequently their territories and their goods will be of Moslem belonging. As for those who were for peace, they thus defended their persons and their property, without seeking to resist”. Chapter XXI Of the burial in a single grave of several dead, and the promise of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) performed by Abu Bakr

One of them wounded, had his hand on his wound, and he was buried so; transferring him to be buried in the new grave, the hand that covered his wound was removed, it returned to its place. And between the day of Ouhod and the day of their burial, a period of forty-six years is underlined”.

Then after a while, having become an adult, I was told that I had to walk this distance. I went to Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab, asking him about this.

He replied: "Order her to walk, then to climb from the very place where she can no longer continue her walk." Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "all the more, she owes it to make an offering." (.....) 5 - It was reported in Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab and Abu Salama Ibn Abdel Rahman have approved the statement of Abdallah Ibn Omar”. 
(1028) 6 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported, "I had made a vow to walk, but suddenly I had kidney pain; I climbed until I arrived in Mecca. I asked Ata Ibn Abi Rabah and others about it, and all of them tell me, "You have to make an offering." So, as soon as I arrived at Medina, I questioned its scholars, who ordered me to walk again, from the place where I felt unable to continue; and I accomplish it”. Yahia reported that he has heard Malek say, "Whoever in Medina makes a vow to walk to the House of Allah, if he finds himself powerless to pursue let him go up, then resume walking from the place where he stopped. If he can no longer walk, let him continue the distance he can do, then go up. He will have to make the offering of a camel, or of a cow or of a sheep, if he finds only this latter offering. Malek was asked at about a man who says to another: "I will carry you to the House of Allah". He answered: "If he has made a vow to carry it on his shoulders, wishing thereby to suffer and tire himself, he owes nothing, and that he walk on foot and make an offering. And if he had not made a vow of such a proposal, let him make the pilgrimage and go up, keeping company with this man, for he had previously said to himself: “I will carry you to the House of Allah. But if the man refuses the pilgrimage, the first will have no obligation towards him”. Yahia reported that we have asked Malek about a man who swore to take a vow of many steps on foot to the house of Allah, or who took a vow not to speak to either his brother or to his father if he did not accomplish such and such a thing, a vow made for what he will be able to accomplish, even if he tried every year to accomplish a part of it, or those whom he has appointed"? Malek replied, “What I know is that this man will have to fulfill his vows as long as it is possible for him; and that he walks as long as he is able to do it and that he draws near to Allah through beneficial deeds". Chapter III Walking to the Ka'ba. (.....) 7 - Malek said: "The best I have heard from learned men about the man or woman who has taken a vow to walk to the house of Allah that, in case that person goes on foot to a pious visit, she will have to walk to race between Al-Safa And Al-Marwa; once this race is accomplished, she will have her wish expiated. If this person makes a vow to walk for a pilgrimage, he will walk until he arrives in Mecca, then resume walking so that he can perform all the rites and continue walking until complete the farewell processional tour around the House".

He asked, "What's the matter with this man"? The faithful answered him: "He made a vow not to speak, not to seek shelter of the sun, not to sit down, and to fast". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) replied: "Order him to speak, to seek shade, to sit down, and to finish one's fast" Malek said: “About this, I did not hear the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) order reparation. But that he urge him to obey Allah, and to abandon what is only disobedience". 
(1030) 9 - Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that a woman came for Abdallah Ibn Abbas, telling him, "I have made a vow to cut my son's throat." Ibn Abbas replied: “Do not slaughter your son, and atone for your oath”. An old man, finding himself with Ibn Abbas, asked him: "Can such an oath be expiated"? Ibn Abbas to reply: “Allah Most High has said the meaning: “Some of you repudiate your wives with formula: "Be for me like my mother's back" (Koran LVIII, 2.) Then, as you know, Allah imposed on this subject, an expiation". 
(1031) 10 - Aisha reported that the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever makes a vow to obey Allah, let him obey Him, and whoever vows to disobey Allah, let him not disobey Him". Malek, interpreting, this hadith, says: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah), hears from the one who does vow to disobey Allah, and that he does not disobey Him, whether a man goes to Damascus, or to Egypt, or to Al-rabza, or the like, i.e. a vow that does not concern an obligation towards Allah, or to speak to no one and in this case, he will owe nothing. If he speaks to another and goes back on his oath, not everything can be considered as disobedience to Allah, because, if so, he must expiate his oath. Chapter V The oath taken lightly. 
(1032) 11 - Ourwa a reported that Aisha, the mother of the believers said: “An oath taken lightly is in saying: 'No, by Allah' and 'Yes, by Allah'. Malek has said, "The best I've heard about it is that the oath done lightly, is that a man swears that a thing was believed to be so, and soon afterwards he realizes that it is not what he believed it to be. Malek also said: “to pronounce an oath, in case the man swears not to sell a garment for ten dinars, then that he sells it at this same price; or that the man swear to strike his servant then that he does not strike him, and others similar cases. Such is the case with the oaths that man has to expiate, which is not for the oath taken lightly. Malek finally said: “For the man who swears by a thing, though he knows it to be wrong, or swears lying, conscious of his doing, whether to please another, or to excuse himself, or to to seize a sum of money, that is so serious that it cannot be expiated”. Chapter VI The oaths where one should not an atonement. 
(1033) 12 - Nafe reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: "Whoever says: 'By Allah' and then says: 'If Allah wills', without proceeding to execute his oath, he is not considered to have reconsidered his oath". Malek said, “The best I've heard about the man who says: "If Allah wills," that he owes nothing until his speech is interrupted, and swears, then continues his words before being silent. But if he is silent and suspends his word, it is not counted to him”. Malek also told the about the man who does not believe in Allah, or that he recognized Him as an equal, then he goes back on his words, he does not have to make an atonement. He is considered neither an incredulous nor a polytheist only when his statements come from his inner self. So, let him ask forgiveness from Allah, and let him not do this again, because he has done wrong”. Chapter VII The oaths where one owes an expiation. 
(1034) 13 - Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said, 'He who makes a oath then he finds that there was better to do, that he expiate his oath, and that he does what is better”. Malek said: "Whoever says, 'I have a vow to make, and he does not designate it, he has to expiate his oath.' Malek continued: “For the affirmation of the oath where the man swears on a thing several times repeating his oath like the case where he says: "I will miss him no such and such, repeating this for two, or three or more times. The expiation in this case, he says, will be that of the oath. Let the man say: "By Allah, I I would not eat this dish, I would not put on such a garment, I would not enter this house, swearing to all this, only once, there is only one atonement. But let a man say to his wife "You are divorced, if you dress in this dress, or I allow you to go at the mosque, this constitutes a sequence of remarks in which he must return to one of two things: having to send his wife away, without being accused of having committed after that, in what he did, a violation of the oath, because in all this, there is only one violation of oath”. Malek finally says: “What is followed is that a woman can make a vow, without having the authorization of her husband, and that for one thing, as long as it does not concern her body, otherwise she must fulfill it, and without thereby causing harm to her husband. If there is harm for him, her husband can prevent it, and she must fulfill this oath”. Chapter VIII The atonement of the oath. 
(1035) 14 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: “Whoever makes an oath by affirming it, then refuses this oath, he must either free a slave, or have ten poor people clothed. As for the one who takes an oath without affirming it, then refuses this oath, he must feed ten poor, giving each a muddle of wheat; if he does not find (something to eat) he must fast for three days”. 
(1036) 15 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar expiated his oath by feeding ten poor people, giving each a mudd of wheat; and he freed slaves several times, if he affirmed his oath”. (.....) 16 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar said: “I saw the men, to expiate their oaths, give a mudd of wheat (using the small mudd). And they thought that was enough. Malek said, "What I have heard better, concerning him who makes expiation of the oath, by giving a garment to the man, and to every woman a long garment and a long veil, for these garments are satisfactory for covering oneself in praying”. Chapter IX The oaths. 
(1037) 17 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) listened to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, swear by his father while en route in a cavalry".

The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: “It is enough for you to give alms of the third of your goods”. 
(1040) 20 - Aisha, the mother of the believers, may Allah be pleased with her was asked about a man who said: “I donate my property for the Ka'ba (without subsequently carrying out his vow); she replied, "His atonement is that of an oath."

(1049) 9 Jaber Ibn Abdallah reported: “We sacrificed victims with the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) the year of Houdaibia, namely a camel in the name of seven people, and a cow in the name of seven”. 
(1050) 10 Abu Ayoub Al-Ansari reported: “We made an offering of a sheep, which every man sacrificed in his name and in the name of his family. But later, the men went by ostentation, to make offering in surplus, seeking by there to distinguish themselves”. Malek said, "The best I've heard for the offering of a camel, or of a cow, or of a sheep, is that the man makes a sacrifice of it in his name, and in the names of the members of his family, of a camel; or that he immolates a cow and a sheep that he owns, involving his family; but he who buys a camel, or a cow, or a sheep with a small group of people to immolate it in common, and where each will pay what he owes for price, taking after the meat of the sacrificial beast is frowned upon. The hadith that we heard about the common offering, is only allowed for the members of a family”. 
(1051) 11 - Ibn Chehab reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has not sacrificed in his name, and in the name of his family, either a camel or a cow”. Malek said, "I don't know which was mentioned by Ibn Chehab." Chapter VI The Sacrifice in the name of what a woman carries as a child (in her womb) and the days of immolation. 
(1052) 12 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "One can make sacrifice, two days, after the Al-Adha festival". (...) 13 - It was reported to Malek that Ali Ibn Abi Taleb was for the same remarks». 
(1053) 14 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar never made a sacrifice in the name of what a woman carries in her womb”. Malek said, "Sacrifice is a sunna and not a obligation and I am not for the one who, able to fulfill this sunnah, and yet he neglects it”. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 24 Book of Slaughtered Beasts First chapter The fact of mentioning the name of Allah on what one cuts the throat. 
(1054) 1 - Urwa reported that the Messenger of Allah was asked r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) "O, Messenger of Allah, Bedouins bring us meat, and we do not know, if they pronounced the name of Allah, during the slaughter of the animal, or not”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: “Pronounce the name of Allah, and eat from it”. Malek said, "It was just at the beginning of Islam." 
(1055) 2 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Abdallah Ibn Ayach Ibn Abi Rabi'a Al-Makhzoumi ordered a servant to slaughter an animal. When the servant was about to do so, he said to him, "Say the name of Allah”, the servant answered: “I have already said it”; Abdallah resumed his request: "Woe to you, pronounce the Name of Allah"; the servant replied, "I have already pronounced it". Then Abdallah Ibn Ayach exclaimed: "By Allah, I will not eat of his flesh." Chapter II What is allowed to cut the throat if it is a necessity. 
(1056) 3 - Ata Ibn Yassar reported that a man from the Ansars, from Bani Haritha was leading a dairy camel to pasture, when he died, he took a sharp stick and cut her throat. We asked, in this regard, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said: "There is no harm, eat its meat". 
(1057) 4 - Mu'az Ibn Sa'd or Sa'd Ibn Mu'az-a reported that a slave girl in Ka'b, kept her sheep in a mountain called "Sal"; one of the sheep, going to perish, she took a stone with which she slew him". The Messenger of Allah was asked about this (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said: "There is no harm in that, eat of his flesh". 
(1058) 5 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas was asked to about the beasts slaughtered by Arab Christians”? He replied, "II there is nothing wrong with that”. Then he recited this verse: “Whoever among you takes them as friends is one of them” Koran V, 51. 
(1059) 6 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Abbas said: "Any animal, whose carotids are already cut, eat of its flesh". (.....) 7 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab said: “About what we cut the throat, no harm, if it is something that cuts, in case of necessity”. Chapter III That we are reluctant to eat the flesh of a slaughtered animal. 
(1060) 8 - Abu Murra the slave of Akil Ibn Abi Taleb, asked Abou Houraira about a sheep, which slaughtered, continues to move. He commanded him to eat of his flesh. Then to inquire further, he asked Zaid Ibn Thabet who said, “A slaughtered beast, will it be able to move? And he forbade him to eat of his flesh. Malek was asked about a sheep, which suffered several fractures. Its owner before it perished, cut its throat, and the blood flowed, without it moving. Malek said: "If he slit her throat while she was still alive and moving, let him eat her meat." Chapter IV The act of slaughtering what the belly of a beast keeps 
(1061) 9 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar used to say: “When you cut the throat of a camel, you must even cut the throat of the little one she has in her belly, if it is completely created and its hair has grown. Once it is removed from its mother's womb, it must be slit in order to let the blood flow from its womb”. 
(1062) 10 Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: “The immolation of what the female animal keeps is done following the immolation of the mother, if it has been completely created and its hair has grown”. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 25 The Book of the Hunt First Chapter Forbidding to eat the meat of the beasts killed by "Al-Mi'rad" and by the stone 
(1063) 1 Nafe' reported: "I launched a stone, on two birds, while I was at "Al-Jourof", and I hit them. One of them, being dead, Abdallah Ibn Omar, threw him. As for the other, Abdallah carried him and cut his throat with a hatchet; but being dead, before he was slain, Abdallah also threw him away». 
(1064) 2 It was reported to Malek that al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad, rejected the act of killing the animal with a Mi'rad or a bullet”. 
(1065) 3 It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al-Moussaiab, was repelled that the domestic animal be killed like the animal which is to be hunted, by an arrow or other means which are similar to it”. Malek said, "I don't see anything wrong with the animal, killed by Al-Mi'rad which burrows into its body and causes its death, let it be eaten. In the words of Allah Blessed and Most High: “O you who believe! Allah will test you about the game that your hands and your spears have procured for you” Koran V, 94. Therefore, whatever a man can get either by his hand, or by his spear, or by any weapon, and that it sinks into the body of the game and causes its death, is a lawful hunt, as Allah has affirmed. 
(1066) 4 - Malek reported: “I have heard versed men say, "If a man succeeds in the hunt of game, being supported by a water (1)or an untrained dog, what is hunted cannot be eaten, unless the shooter's spear has penetrated the game while killing it, in such a way that no one can suspect that it was he who killed it; consequently the game is found obviously dead. (1) the game is found in a pond or lake and is dead without it being possible to determine whether it is by the blow of the hunter or by drowning after having only been bruised. Malek also said, "There is no harm in eating the game even after having found it later, but that one makes sure that his death was caused either by a trained dog or by an arrow. But if the killed game has been found a day later, it is forbidden to to eat". (1) Al-Mi'rad: is a piece of iron, like a arrow, very broad in the middle, and very pointed at the ends. It is indisputable, that if the animal is struck by the extremity of Al-Mi'rad it is to eat; but if it is struck in the middle, it is not, for it is illicit”. Chapter II Hunting with dogs or trained birds 
(1067) 5 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said about the trained dog: "To eat whatever it brings you, whether it has been killed or not". 
(1068) 6 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: Even if this dog ate game or not». 
(1069) 7 - Malek reported that Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas was questioned about the trained dog if he had killed the game”. Sa'd replied, "To eat game even if there is only one piece left." 
(1070) 8 - Malek reported that he heard the men versed in religion say concerning the hunting with the aid of birds such as the hawk, the falcon and the eagle or their like, that if these birds seized game like trained dogs, it would not there is no harm in eating what they capture and kill, if the name of Allah had already been pronounced before sending them to hunt”. Malek also said, "What I've heard, best to about the game that we get rid of the claws of a falconer or the paws of a dog, waiting for this game to be dead, that it is unlawful to eat it. Malek also said, “The same is true, for the game which is slain while being between the claws of the falcon, or held by the legs of a dog, but which the hunter leaves without slaying it, until such game is killed by the falcon or the dog, he can not not legally eat it”. And it's the same, adds Malek, in the case of the hunter who seizes his game while still alive, but does not hasten to slaughter it, to the point that he dies; again, it is not legal to eat it”. Malek finally said, “What is unquestionably followed is that when a Muslim sends a trained dog belonging to a Magus, behind game, which he seizes and kills, this game can be eaten lawfully, even if the Muslim has not slaughtered it. His case is to be compared to a Muslim who uses the knife of a Magus with which he cuts his throat, or who uses the arrow or the bow of this Mage to hunt; thus its hunted game is legal to eat. In case the Magus sends the trained dog of a Muslim for hunting, what is seized is forbidden to eat, unless it is slaughtered. (In pronouncing the name of Allah). This case is similar to that where the Magus uses the arrow and the arc of a Moslem, with which he kills the game or of his knife with which the Magus cuts the throat of the game; none of this is legal to eat. Chapter III The subject of sea fishing. 
(1071) 9 - Nafe' reported that Abdel-Rahman Ibn Abi Houraira asked Abdallah Ibn Omar, concerning the animals that the sea throws on the banks. who says It is forbidden to eat them”. Nafe' added: "Then Abdallah reconsidered his words, brought the Koran and recited: “The game of the sea and the food which is therein is permitted to you” Koran V, 96. Nafe' continues: “So, Abdallah Ibn Omar sent me to Abdel Rahman Ibn Abi Houraira, to say to him: “ There is no harm in eating them”. (1072)'10 - Sa'd Al-Jari, the freedman of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said, “I asked Abdallah Ibn Umar about whales killing each other, or freezing to death? Can we eat them? He replied, "There is no harm in that." Then I asked them subject, Abdallah Ibn amr Ibn al-A's, who gave me the same answer". 
(1073) 11 Abu Salama Ibn Abdel-Rahman a reported that Abu Houraira and Zaid Ibn Thabet, saw no harm in eating what is thrown by the sea”. 
(1074) 12 Abu Salama Ibn Abdel-Rahman reported that people from "Al-Jar" (a place near Medina) came to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam in Medina, asking him about what the sea throws up, whether it is legal to eat it". He answered them, "There is no difficult to do it”. Then he added: “Go to Zaid Ibn Thabet and Abou Houraira to find out more, then come back and tell me what they will tell you”. They went, asked them the same question and received the same answer again. They returned to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam, reporting to him what was said; then he answered them: "That is what I told you". Malek said: "There is no harm in eating the fish that a magus catches, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said about the sea: “Her water is purifying, and her dead animals are lawful”. Malek added: "And if one eats these fish, even dead one must not take into account the fisherman". Chapter IV The ban on eating carnivorous animals 
(1075) 13 - Abu Tha'iaba reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "The eating of the flesh of a carnivorous animal is forbidden". 
(1076) 14 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "The meat of the carnivorous animal is forbidden to eat". Malek said, "And that's what's being tracked." Chapter V What is forbidden to eat the flesh of animals 
(1077) 15 - Malek said, "What I have best understood about horses, mules and donkeys is that their flesh is not to be eaten, for according to the words of Allah Blessed and Most High: “He created for you horses, mules and donkeys, for you to ride them and for display” Koran XVI, 8. He also said about herds: “...so that some of them serve you as mounts and others as food” Koran XL, 79. He also said: "So that men invoke the name of Allah on the beast of the herds" Koran XXII, 34. And: "eat of it and feed the one who is satisfied with it and the one who begs" Koran XXII, 36. Malek, interpreting these verses said, "I heard say that the unfortunate is the poor, and the beggar is the man who stands in the way of asking for alms". Malek further said, “Allah mentioned the horses, mules and donkeys to be ridden and for display, as for the “herds, they are to be ridden and for food”. Malek finally said, "He who is content (with little food) is also poor." Chapter VI About the skins of dead animals 
(1078) 16 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas Reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) Upon him the grace and peace of Allah passed through a dead sheep which had been given as alms to a freedwoman of Maimuna the wife of the Prophet r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's favor and peace); he said, "Have you not benefited from the skin of this animal"? He was answered: “O Messenger of Allah, he is dead”, he continued: “The flesh of this animal is forbidden to you”. 
(1079) 17 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "In case the skin is tanned, it is purified". 
(1080) 18 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), orders that one uses the skins of animals, once they are tanned”. Chapter VII One who is forced to eat the flesh of a dead animal 
(1081) 19 - Malek said, "Whatever he has better understood, about the man who is forced to eat the flesh of a dead animal, is that he can eat it until he is satiate, by making a provision. But if he can dispense with it, let him reject this flesh” Malek was asked about a man, who finds by necessity compelled to eat the flesh of a dead animal, while there is fruit or crops or sheep belonging to people, in the same place where this man is. Malek said: “If he thinks that the owners of these fruits, or these harvests, or these sheep, will give him alms as a necessity, so that he will not be considered a thief and have his hand cut off, I think he can eat of what he has found, in order to subsist, without making provision. And this means a lot to me more preferable than eating the flesh of a dead animal. And if the man might not be given alms, and be considered a thief for taking something, then. eating the flesh of a dead animal is preferred to me. And he can eat enough of this flesh though I fear he will become a transgressor if he does not take not of this flesh, preferring better to seize the goods of others in an illicit way, without an obligation”. Malek said, "That's the best I've heard." MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement the Merciful Book 26 The Book of Al-'aqiqa First chapter From the subject of Al-'aqiqa 
(1082) 1 A man from Abi Damra reported from his father that the Messenger of Allah was asked to (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) about Al-"âqiqa". He replied: "I do not like the neglect of obligations". said: "Whoever Allah has granted a child to, I like it if he makes a sacrifice for it, if he is able". 
(1083) 2 Ja'far Ibn Muhammad reported from his father that Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had weighed down, which were cut off of the hair of Hassan, of Houssein, of Zainab and of Oum Koulthoum then she had paid alms in money worth the weight of the cut hair”. 
(1084) 3 Muhammad Ibn Ali Ibn Hussain, said: “Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had weighed the cut hair of Hassan and of Houssein, then paid alms from the weight in silver”. Chapter II Works in Al-aqiqa 
(1085) 4 Nafe' reported that if any which member of his family asked, Al aqiqa;Abdallah Ibn Umar, , gave it to him. He sacrificed a sheep in the name of his male and female children. 
(1086) 5 Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Al-Hareth a reported that he heard his father say that it was acceptable for him to make a sacrifice, like aqiqa, even of a bird”. (1) Al-àqiqa: originally and according to Al-Asma, this term pointed to the hair lying on the head of the newborn; according to others, Al-àqiqa means the sheep that is sacrificed, once the infant's head is shaved. 
(1087) 6 - It was reported to Malek, that a sacrifice was made in the names of Hassan and Housein, sons of Ali Ibn Abi Taleb. 
(1088) 7 • Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father Ourwa Al-Zoubair sacrificed in the names of her children, male and female, a sheep for each”. Malek said about Al-'aqiqa: “Whoever wants sacrifice in the name of his children, let him sacrifice a sheep for each of them, male or female. Although this sacrifice is not no obligation however it is a good tradition which until then, is always followed. So, whoever performs Al-'âqiqa in the name of his child, this is considered a rite and a sacrifice. And he is not allowed the sheep to be one-eyed, or thin, or fractured, or diseased. None of his meat will be for sale, nor his skin, and his bones are to be broken. The family that made this sacrifice, can eat of this flesh, can even give alms, but the child in whose name this sacrifice was made cannot touch his blood”. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 27 The Book of Successions First chapter Of the estate of the reservatories (1089) - Malek said: “What is traditionally practiced, and which I have seen men versed in religion apply for the question of the destination of the inheritance to a son, and which comes to him from a father or a mother is that: when the one of them dies leaving male and female children, the boy will have the share of two girls; if the daughters are more than two, they will have two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there is only one, she will be half. In the event that other partners present themselves (according to the prescriptions of Allah), having the right to the inheritance and that among them is a boy, we begin by giving to those who have the right, then we will share what remains between them, each according to his share. The children of the son, whether male or female, will have the part of the own son, thereby depriving the other successors. If there are own sons and children of an own (deceased) son, and the own sons have sons, the latter will not have to share the inheritance with the children of the deceased. If the deceased does not have a son, but two daughters or more, the daughters of his dead son, will not share in the inheritance with his daughters, except if there is with them, a boy who enjoys everything like them of the same kinship or further away, leaving a remainder of the inheritance which will be distributed among them in such a way that the share of the boy will be equal to that of two girls; but if nothing remains of it they will have no right to any share. If the deceased has only one daughter, she is entitled to half the inheritance, as for the daughter of her son, one or more, she will receive (just like the others), each the sixth. But in case there is a boy with them, they will not have nothing, not even a sixth. But if after the inheritance is divided, there remains somewhere, this must be given to the son's boy and daughters in such a way that the boy's share is equal to that of two daughters; on the other hand, he who enjoys a distant relationship has no right to anything. In the event that the division of the inheritance has taken place, and there is nothing left of it, they will have no share, and that is in accordance with the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in his Book: “As for your children. Allah commands you to give the boy an equal share to that of two daughters. If the daughters are more than two, two-thirds of the inheritance will go to them; if there is only one, half will belong to him”. Koran IV, 11. Chapter II Of the inheritance of the man coming to him from his wife and that of the woman coming to him from her husband (1090) - Malek said: "And from the heritage of man which comes to him from his dead wife, leaving neither a son, nor a child of one son or another, is half. But if the woman leaves a son or a child of a son, whether male or female, her husband will receive a quarter, and that after having made either a will or debts which have been discharged”. As for the inheritance of the woman who comes to him from her husband dead, leaving neither a son nor a child of a son, he is a quarter of them. But if he leaves a son, or a child of a son, boy whether he or daughter, his wife will have the eighth after her legacies and debts have been paid. This with reference to the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in his Book: “If your wives have no children, half of what they left you is yours. If they have a child, a quarter of what they left to you comes back to you, after their legacies or debts have been paid. If you have no children, a quarter of what you have left will return to your wives. If you have a child, the eighth of what you left belongs to them, after your legacies or your debts have been discharged” Koran IV, 12. Chapter III The heritage of the father and the mother coming to them from their child (1091) - Malek said: "What is unquestionably followed and which I have seen the versed men apply in Medina regarding the inheritance of the father accruing to him from his son or daughter is the following in the event of the death of the son or daughter, leaving a male child or a son of a male child, the share of the father is one-sixth of the inheritance as prescribed by Allah; if the son or daughter died, leaving neither a son nor a child of a son and that he is male, we begin by donating the shares to the heirs (in other words the reserveees), and if what remains is a sixth or more, it is from the father. If what remains is not equivalent to the sixth, or if it exceeds it, the father is entitled to the sixth according to the prescribed forms”. For the inheritance of the rightful mother of her dead son or daughter: “If either has a child or a son of a male or female child with brothers, two or more, whether male or female siblings, or even of a father or a mother, the share of the mother is one-sixth”. If the deceased leaves neither a child nor a son of a child, nor two brothers or more, the mother is entitled to one third, except if two other cases arise, namely: - In one of the cases, where the man dies, leaving his wife and father and mother; his wife is entitled to a quarter, his mother to a third of what remains and which is a quarter of the capital”. - In the other, where the woman dies, leaving her husband and his father and mother; her husband is entitled to half, her mother to a third of what remains and which is the sixth of the capital”. This is in accordance with the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in his Book: “If the deceased left a son, a sixth of the inheritance will go to each of his father and mother. If he has no children and his parents inherit him: The third will go to his mother. If he has brothers: The sixth will return to his mother” Koran IV, 11 . And the tradition followed is to consider that the brothers are two or more”. Chapter IV The inheritance going to the uterine brothers (1092) - Malek said: “What is followed at Medina is that the uterine brothers will not share in the inheritance if there is a son, or children of a son, whether male or female; uterine brothers do not deserve any inheritance in the presence of a grandfather (father's father); but they inherit in any other case so that each has one-sixth of the inheritance, whether male or female, if there are two; in case they are more than two, they will be partners, all receiving a third of the inheritance divided between them, so that the part of the boy is equal to that of two girls. This is in accordance with what is said by Allah Blessed and Most High in his Book: "When a man or a woman, having neither parents nor children, leaves an inheritance, if he has a brother or a sister : the sixth will go to each of them. If they are several, they will share a third of the inheritance” Coran IV, 12. In this case, male and female are on the same footing of equality”. Chapter V The legacy of the full brothers (1093) - Malek said: “What is followed at Medina is that the full brothers will not share in the inheritance in the presence of a son, or a child of a son or of the father. But they inherit with the daughters, and the daughters of a son, the rest of inheritance, unless a father of the father is found alive, and let them be agnates. We begin by distributing the inheritance to those who are the reserveees, and if there is any inheritance left, it will be the share of the full brothers and sisters, dividing it among them according to what is prescribed in the Book of Allah namely, that the boy will have a share equal to that of two daughters; and if nothing remains of the inheritance, they will have nothing”. Malek said, “If the deceased leaves neither a father nor a grandfather (father of the father), neither a son, nor a child of a son, whether male or female, his full sister will have half the inheritance; if his sisters are more than two and that they are full, they will have two thirds; if they have a brother, these sisters, being two or more, they will have nothing of the inheritance. One begins by giving the shares of the inheritance to the reservatories; if there is any left of this inheritance, it will be distributed among the full brothers and sisters, making the boy's share equal to that of two girls. Except one case where they will receive nothing, being partners with the sons of the mother, in their share which is the third. In this case it is the fact that a woman dies leaving a husband, a mother, uterine brothers and sisters, full brothers and sisters, her husband will have half, her mother the third, his uterine brothers and sisters a third; for what remains, it will be the share of the full brothers and sisters who will be partners with the sons of the mother, of the third, so that the boy will have an equal share with that of the girl. being all brothers and sisters of the deceased mother, moreover they inherited by their reference to the mother. Allah Blessed and Most High said in his Book: "When a man or a woman having neither parents nor children, leaves an inheritance: If he has a brother or a sister: The sixth will be up to each of them. If there are several: They will share one third of the inheritance”. Koran IV, 12. For this they are partners in this prescribed part, because they are all brothers and sisters from the mother”. Chapter VI The legacy of blood brothers (1094) - Malek said: “What is followed at Medina, in the event that a man dies, leaving only consanguineous brothers and sisters, without having any siblings with them, the consanguineous will have their share of the estate just as if they were siblings, namely at the same title of males and females; however blood relatives will have nothing of the heritage of the uterine children if they exist, for blood relatives are the same as blood relatives. siblings, but far from being related to the uterine children who are begotten from the same mother”. Malek said, “Yes, at the meeting of siblings siblings, and with them, the consanguineous brothers, we realize that for the first, there is a male, the consanguineous brothers will have no part of the inheritance. If the full heirs are female, or more than female, not having with them a male, the full sister receives half the inheritance, and the consanguineous sisters will have the sixth, completing two-thirds. If there is a male with consanguineous sisters (of the father), these will no longer have a share in the inheritance. We begin the inheritance, and what remains of the inheritance will be divided between consanguineous brothers and sisters (of the father) so that the male will have a share equal to that of two females; if there is nothing left of the legacies, they will have nothing. If the heirs are two or more full sisters, they will receive two-thirds of what is bequeathed, and consanguineous sisters will have no inheritance rights, unless with them, there is a consanguineous brother, in this case one begins by giving the proper heirs their shares, and what remains of the inheritance goes to the consanguineous (of the father) so that the male will have twice the share of a female. If nothing remains of the inheritance, they will have nothing. On the other hand, the uterine brothers and sisters, siblings, consanguineous, if each of them is one, he will have the sixth, if they are two and beyond, they will have the third, remembering that the share of the male will be equal to that of the female, being both on the same footing of equality”. Chapter VII Grandfather's Legacy 
(1095) 1 - It was reported to Yahia Ibn Sa'id that Mu'awia Ibn Abi Sufian wrote to Zaid Ibn Thabet asking him about the grandfather's inheritance. Zaid Ibn Thabet answered him: "You asked me in writing, about the inheritance of the grandfather, and it is Allah who is most informed, therefore, it is a matter of which only the caliphs can decide. I have witnessed two predecessor caliphs, who bequeathed half to him in the presence of a single brother, a third if they are two brothers, and always a third whatever the number of these brothers. 
(1096) 2 - Ibn Chehab reported that Kabissa Ibn Zouaïb, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had given to the grandfather the share, what people give him today”. 
(1097) 3 - It was reported to Malek: "What Soulaiman Ibn Yassar said that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, Osman Ibn Affan, and Zaid Ibn Thabet gave the grandfather a third share of the inheritance, if there were any brothers”. Malek said, "What is followed in Medina, and which I have seen to be applied by versed men, is that the grandfather, namely the father's father has nothing of the inheritance of the father if the latter is still alive. He is entitled to the sixth, if he finds himself with a son, or a child of a son (also called his grandson). This is up to him, so much that the deceased left neither a mother nor a paternal aunt, in this case one begins by giving the heirs their shares and what remains of the inheritance, if it is one-sixth or more, the grand -father will have the sixth. Malek also said: "In case the grandfather found with full brothers and sisters of the deceased, the shares are first given to the reserveees, then for what remains, it will go to the grandfather, and to the siblings, taking into account that the grandfather will receive what will be advantageous to him, namely: either a third of what remains, to him and to the siblings, or whatever either be considered just like one of the full brothers, therefore, he will have the same share as each of them, or he will have one-sixth of all the capital, thus, what is most advantageous is to give to the grandfather, his share being subtracted, the remainder will be distributed in such a way that the share of the male is twice equal to that of the female, except in the case which will be the following: A woman who dies leaving her husband, her mother, a sibling, and a grandfather, her inheritance will be distributed as follows: The husband will have half, the mother, the third, the grandfather, the sixth, the full sister , half. Then we will add the sixth part of the grandfather with the half, part of the full sister, and we will distribute the addition to three thirds, so that the male will have the doubled share of the female, thus the grandfather will have his two-thirds, and the sister, one-third. Malek said, “The legacy of siblings consanguineous in the presence of the grandfather, and this if there are no full brothers and sisters with them, is similar to the inheritance of full brothers and sisters, so that the share of the male is double that of the female. If there are full brothers and sisters on the one hand, and blood relatives on the other bet, the siblings make heirs consanguineous (who in reality are not being eliminated by them) and share the succession with the grandfather, in view of their number. Which will not be the case, if the brothers and being with the grandfather are only uterine, because they will have nothing in the presence of the grandfather who alone will have the right to all the inheritance. Thus, after the reserve on the part of the grandfather, it is the full brothers and sisters who will share in what remains of the inheritance, dismissing the consanguineous brothers and sisters who will not be entitled to anything, unless the siblings are only one female. If she is one, she will have her share with the grandfather, though the number of his consanguineous brothers and sisters who will also have their share. Besides, the share that the female will have is entirely fact independent of that which her blood relatives will have, namely that she will have half of all the capital, and what remains will be divided between his consanguineous brothers and sisters, so that the share of the male will be double that of the female. And if nothing remains, they will have no share”. Chapter VIII Grandmother's Legacy 
(1098) 4 - Kabissa Ibn Zouaib reported: "A maternal grandmother went to Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq to ask him about his share of the inheritance." Abu Bakr replied: "You are not entitled to anything according to the Book of Allah, and I do not believe that something is due to you, according to the sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace). Come back, once I have asked people about it”. Inquiring, Al-Moughira Ibn Chou'ba replied: "I was a witness, when the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) appropriated to him the sixth. Abu Bakr asked him: “Was there another witness”? Mouhammad Ibn Maslama stood up and repeated the same words of Al-Moughira. So Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq reported what was said to the grandmother. Then the other grandmother, the paternal mother, came in turn to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, claiming his share of the inheritance. He replied, “Nothing belongs to you according to the Book of Allah, and what has been conceived as a part of it, concerns only one other than you. And from my part, I have no right to make additions to the norms of the distribution of inheritance. But, he is that sixth; if you and the other grandmother are both alive, it is yours, and if one of you is alive, she will have it alone”. 
(1099) 5 - Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad a reported: “The two grandmothers went to Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, who wanted to deliver the sixth to the maternal grandmother. But one man from the Ansars said to him: "it is as if you were trying to neglect the share of the one who inherits the other grandmother in the event of his death, while he is still alive (by this he means the son of the son). So, Abou Bakr appropriated to the two grandmothers, the sixth shared equally”. 
(1100) 6 - Abd Rabbih Ibn Sa'id a reported that Abu Bakr Ibn Abdel Rahman Ibn Al-Hareth Ibn Hisham only gave part to the two grandmothers”. Malek said, “What is tracked and who is indisputable, and that men versed in religion apply is that the grandmother, (mother's mother) inherits nothing as long as the mother is still alive. Apart from this case, the sixth is given to him, according to what is prescribed. As for the grandmother, (mother of the father), she inherits nothing in the presence of the mother or the father. With the exception of this case, she is entitled to the sixth, according to what is prescribed. If it happens that both grandmothers are alive, while the deceased has neither father nor mother, Malek said, "I heard that if the mother of the mother is closer to the deceased than the other grandmother, the first is entitled to the sixth. If the father's mother is closer, or the two grandmothers of the deceased, in the same situation, the sixth is shared equally between the two”. Malek also said, "Inheritance is not law of any other woman among the relations to the degree of grandparents, with the exception of the mothers of the father, and of the mother, because it was reported to me that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him Grace and the peace of Allah) was for the inheritance of the grandmothers. After him, Abu Bakr began to inquire until he received the affirmation of the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) that he had inherited the grandmothers. (In the penultimate hadith 1098-4, it was clarified) that the father's mother went to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, asking him for her share; he said to him: "I have no right to make additions to the prescribed rules, if you are both alive, the sixth belongs to you both, and if only one is alive, she will have it alone”. Malek added: "We haven't known anyone who has inherited, apart from the two grandmothers, from the beginning of Islam to the present day". Chapter IX From the legacy of the collaterals 
(1101) 7 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab asked for the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam)(On him the grace and peace of Allah) about the inheritance of consanguineous he answered him: “It is enough for you, on this subject to make reference, to the verse which was revealed in summer, and which is found at the end of the surah "Women". Malek said, “What is tracked and who is indisputable, and that the men versed in Medina apply, is to consider the collaterals, to two aspects: thus, what is the verse mentioned at the beginning of the sura "Women: verse No 12" "When a man or a woman wife, having neither parents nor children leaves an inheritance: If he has a brother or a sister: the sixth will go to each of them. If there are several: They will be distributed, the third of inheritance”. This first form of inheritance does not entitle any part of the uterine sisters and brothers, so that there are no sons nor father. For the other form of inheritance, it is to be found in the verse mentioned at the end of surah The Women, verse No 176, where Allah Blessed and Most High said: "They ask you for a decision concerning the inheritances . Say: “Allah gives you instructions regarding distant kinship: If someone dies without leaving any children but only a sister, half of his estate will go to this one. A man inherits from his sister if she has no children. If he has two sisters, two-thirds of the estate will go to them. If he leaves brothers and sisters, a share equal to that of two women goes to a man. Allah gives you a clear explanation so that you do not go astray. Allah knows everything”. Koran II, 176. Malek said, "This last form of inheritance, where the brothers and sisters are successors-agnates, if there is not a child to the deceased, they will share the inheritance with the grandfather, to whom belongs the right to inherit in the presence of the brothers and sisters, because he has the primacy of it more than they; even he inherits with the male children of the deceased, the share of the sixth, as for the brothers, (of the deceased), they inherit nothing, in the presence of his male children (of the deceased). How will he not be like one of them, when he has the part of the sixth in the presence of the children of the deceased? How will he not have the third with the full brothers and sisters, and the uterine brothers and sisters had the third? So it is the grandfather who makes the part of the heritage of the uterine brothers and sisters, and his presence deprives them forever. And it is he who deserves the part which, in fact, was their right. If the grandfather had not had the third, the uterine brothers and sisters, should have had it, so the grandfather took this which was to go to consanguineous brothers and sisters, and where the uterine brothers and sisters had more the right of the third party than the first. But the grandfather has the primacy of having the third uterine successors”. Chapter X About the paternal aunt 
(1102) 8 - Abdel Rahman Ibn Hanzala Al-Zourqi has reported that a freedman of the Quraishites, known as Ibn Mursi told him: “I was sitting with Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, once he said the midday prayer, he called his servant: “O Yarfa! Bring me this letter, a letter that I had already written about the aunt, so that we can discuss its content and have a consultation”. Yarfa, brought it to him with a basin, or a glass containing water. Suspecting the contents of the letter, Omar erased the writings of the letter, then he said: "If Allah would have wanted you to be heiress, he would have assigned it (in His Book: The Koran)”, he took it up twice. 
(1103) 9 - Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Hazm a reported that he frequently heard his father say, "Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said, "I am amazed at the status of the paternal aunt: she bequeaths her inheritance, but is not entitled to any share to inherit." Chapter XI The legacy of those who constitute “Al âssaba” (1) “Al âssaba” is the plural of the term “asseb” designating any male heir entitled to the inheritance, whether partial once the reserved parties have received their shares if they exist, or total if the latter do not exist. About “Al-assaba”, Malek said: “The standard followed in Medina, and which is far from disputed, and which I have seen learned men apply is the following: - The full brother has the primacy of inheriting than the consanguineous brother. - The consanguineous brother has more right to inherit than the sons of the first brother. - the sons of the full brother have to inherit before those of the consanguineous brother. - the sons of the consanguineous brother take precedence in the inheritance over the grandsons of the sibling. - the grandsons of the consanguineous brother precede in succession the paternal first uncle. - The consanguineous paternal uncle inherits before the first cousins. - The consanguineous paternal cousin takes precedence in the inheritance of the uncle, the first paternal of the father. Malek added: “Any questions that have been put to me at the subject of inheritance says: "Al-'âssaba", will be explained as follows: the inheritance belongs to him considering his descent and not his ancestry. If this agnate is the son of a blood relative, but closer to the deceased than the sons of a sibling, it is more to him that the inheritance belongs than to them. If they are all exequal on account of their descent going back to a single father, and whether they are the sons of a consanguine or of a sibling, that the inheritance is equally divided between them. If the father of certain agnates is the first brother of the deceased's father, and if other agnates are found, whose father is the consanguineous brother of the deceased's father, the inheritance must go to the former, for Allah Blessed and Most High has said: "However those who are bound by kinship are closer to each other according to the Book of Allah. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower” Quran VIII, 75. Malek said: “And the grandfather, father of the father, much more right to inheritance than the sons of the first brother, more even than the first paternal uncle. The son of the first brother has more right to the patronage of freedmen more than the grandfather”. Chapter XII Those to whom the inheritance does not belong Malek said, “What is tracked, and indisputable, and that I have seen even versed men apply in Medina is that the inheritance does not in any way belong either to the son of a uterine brother, nor to the grandfather, father of the mother, nor to the paternal uncle who is a uterine brother, nor to the maternal uncle, nor to the mother-grandmother of the woman's father, nor to the daughter of the full brother, nor to the paternal aunt nor to the maternal aunt". Malek added: “Also any woman as she has been mentioned in the Koran, whose relationship to the dead is so distant, will inherit nothing. It is the same for all the other women, put aside, those who are mentioned in the Koran. Allah has, moreover, mentioned in his Book the following inheritances: - The inheritance of the mother returning to her from her son. - That of their father's daughters. - That of her husband's wife. - That of the full sisters. - That of consanguineous sisters. - That of the uterine sisters. - And the grandmother will receive, according to what was decided by the Prophet r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah). - Finally, the woman inherits the slave whom she had freed for Allah Blessed and Most High said: “About the slaves”: “They are your brothers in religion, they are yours” Koran XXXIII ,5. Chapter XIII The legacy of those who follow another religion 
(1104) 10 Usama Ibn Zaid reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "The Muslim does not inherit the impious". 
(1105) 11 Ibn Shehab reported that Ali Ibn Abi Taleb told him that Akil and Taleb inherited Abou Taleb, whereas Ali, did not inherit anything even from the residence (returning to Bani Hashem) Located at "Al-Chi'b". Note: Note that Ali and his brother Ja'far are converted to Islam, as for Taleb and Akil, they were on their polytheism; which explains why the latter were the only ones to inherit their father. 
(1106) 12 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar a reported that Muhammad Ibn Al-Ach'ath related that his paternal aunt, who is said to have been either Jewish or Christian, died; Muhammad Ibn Al-Ach'ath came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, asking him: "Who will be his heir"?. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab answered him: "His heirs are his co-religionists”. Mouhammad Ibn Al-Ach'ath, always came to inquire about this subject with Osman Ibn Affan; and the latter replied: “Do you think I have forgotten what Omar told you? his heirs are his co-religionists”. 
(1107) 13 Ismail Ibn Abi Hakim reported that a Christian slave, freed by Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz, died. Ismail continued: “Omar Ibn Abdel Aziz ordered me to deposit his property (namely his inheritance) in the public treasury”. 
(1108) 14 Malek reported that a man known by his confidence, told him that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab say: "Omar Ibn Al-Khattab refused that the inheritance should go to a foreigner, except to one who was born in an Arab territory ( Muslim so to speak). Malek said, “If a pregnant woman coming from the country of the enemy, to settle in a Muslim country, the child who will be born there, will inherit it after his death, and she will inherit it in her turn if he dies. This is what is mentioned in the Book of Allah”. Malek added, “What is followed in Medina, and according to the sunna which is not to be disputed, which versed men apply, .c is that the Muslim does not inherit an impious person, neither for parental good, nor by patronage, nor to be of the same lap, and this Muslim cannot eliminate one of the heirs of the impious person». Malek finally said: "It is the same for the one who not having the right to inheritance, he cannot make the other heirs absent if they happen to be”. Chapter XIV The legacy of those whose outcome is unknown whether they were killed or disappeared, or whatever... 
(1109) 15 - Malek reported from Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdel Rahman, according to the words of more than one of their versed men, that the inheritance does not go to those who were killed in the days of "Al-Jamal", of "Siffine", of “Al-Harra”, and of “Koudaid”. None of them inherited his companion, except the one who was known to have been killed before his companion. - Malek said, "Which, by the way, is a rule unquestionably followed in Medina, and which has never been disputed by men versed in religion, hence what is a respected tradition is never to share inheritance with those who died in during a drowning, or in a slaughter, or in other circumstances of death, if one has not made sure of the death of one of them. Their legacy goes to their living successors.” - Malek added: "It is inappropriate that a no one inherits another, when he suspects it; a person inherit from another only on the basis of either knowledge or truthful testimonies, as such let us consider a man who died with a slave whom his father had freed, the sons of the Arab man (i.e. the one who freed the slave) say: "We have a right to the inheritance of the freed man, because it is our father who has freed him. freed and he is entitled to his inheritance”. However, this is not their right to inherit, without knowledge of the facts or the presence of witnesses, who justify that this freedman died before the father. If this is the case, those closest to this freedman inherit it”. Malek said, "In the same way, consider two full brothers who died, and where one of them had a son, as to the other he didn't have one. And that these full brothers had an inbred brother. Ignoring which of the two had died before the other, the inheritance of the one who did not have a son will revert to his consanguineous brother, without him giving any of the inheritance to the son of his full brother”. Malek finally said, "Let's consider again, the case where the paternal aunt dies at the same time as her brother's son, or a brother's daughter with her paternal uncle, without it being possible know who died before the other. If this will be ignored, the paternal uncle inherits nothing from his brother's daughter, and the brother's son will receive nothing from his paternal aunt”. Chapter XV The inheritance of the adulterine or anathemized child (i.e.: considered to be natural) 
(1110) 16 It was reported to Malek that Urwa Ibn al-Zoubair said about the anathematized or adulterine child: “If he dies, his mother inherits him from the Book of Allah to Him the power and the glory; his uterine brothers are entitled to their share of the inheritance according to the law, and for what remains, it will go to the heirs who are relatives of the mother, if she is a slave. If the mother is an Arab (i.e. free from condition) she will have her share of the estate, as well as her uterine brothers, as for the rest, it will go to the public treasury (right of all Muslims) Malek said: "It is the same thing that was reported by Suleiman Ibn Yassar”. And Malek added: "And that's what which was practiced by the learned men of Medina". MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 28 The Book of Marriage First chapter About the engagement 
(1111) 1 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Let none of you ask for the hand of a woman that his brother (of the same religion) has already asked for it". 
(1112) 2 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “Let none of you ask for the hand of a woman, whom a brother of his has already asked for”. Malek, explaining the words of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) mentioned before and it is Allah who is most informed about it said: "Once a man grants his engagement with a woman, let her bow to him by agreeing to set a well-determined dowry, and that they are well understood, that she will have what is suitable for her; it's the case of such a woman to whom a man is forbidden to ask her in marriage, and he did not want to hear the case of the woman, who being in disagreement with her suitor, without her willingly accepting it, not to be asked to marry again. Otherwise, people are in a state of perversity”. 
(1113) 3 Abdel-Rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported that, his father, interpreting this verse: "There will be no fault to reproach you for, if you allude to a marriage proposal, or if you do not tell anyone of your intention. Allah knows you are thinking of these women however, don't promise them nothing in secret: Just speak to them the words that befit them” Koran II, 235. He said, "Let a man tell a woman, then that she is in the waiting period following the death of her husband "You are so dear to me, I desire your person, and may Allah bring you good and blessings" or other words of the same meaning . Chapter II Ask the consent of the virgin girl, and the widow to marry them 
(1114) 4 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “A widow has in person much more right than her protector (to decide on a marriage); as for the virgin girl, it is to her protector (father or other) that the granting of a marriage license is requested; its acquiescence to it, is its silence”. 
(1115) 5 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab a reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "A woman can only be asked for marriage after having had the permission of her protector, or the opinion of her wise parents, or that of the Sultan/or prince". 
(1116) 6 - It was reported to Malek that Al-Kassem Ibn Mouhammad and Salem Ibn Abdallah had given their daughters in marriage without their authorization”. Malek said, "That's what is followed, for the marriage of our virgin daughters”. And he added: "And the virgin has no right to enjoy her wealth, until she is in the marital house, and shows insight of mind." 
(1117) 7 - It was reported to Malek, that, Al-Kassem Ibn Mouhammad, Salem Ibn Abdallah, and Souleiman Ibn Yassar said about the virgin girl: "Her father can present her in marriage, without having her license, and she has to obey him". Chapter III The business of dowry and gift 
(1118) 8 - Sahl Ibn Sa'd Al Sa'idi reported that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! I give you my person”. Remaining unanswered for a long time, a man stood up and said: "O Messenger of Allah give her to me in marriage, if you have not no need for her". The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) asked him: "Do you have something, to give it to him as dowry"? - The other replied: "I have only my izar" - The Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) continued: “in case you give it to him, you will remain without izar; find something”. “I couldn't find anything,” said the man. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) continued: “Seek, even if it is only an iron ring”. The man searched but found nothing. The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: “Do you remember any suras of the Koran”? - The man replied: “Yes, I remembered such and such a sura”. So the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the favor and peace of Allah) said to him: "I give you this woman in marriage, for what you have retained from the Koran". 
(1119) 9 - Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab a reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "Any man who marries a woman afflicted with madness or leprosy, and has had intercourse with her, he must pay her her dowry in full, and he must claim an indemnity from her protector”. Malek said while interpreting the previous subject: “The protector of the woman, be it her father, her brother or whoever, having given her in marriage, knowing her illness, he must pay her indemnity to her husband. But if her protector, giving her in marriage, is either a cousin, or another protector or one of her relatives, namely, that they were not aware of her illness, they will not have nothing to pay as compensation. As for the woman, she will return what she had taken as a dowry, and a certain sum will be left to her as compensation, for what her husband had enjoyed of her". (.....) 10 Nafe' reported that a daughter of Oubaidallah Ibn Omar whose mother was the daughter of Zaid ibn Al-Khattab, was the wife of a son of Abdallah Ibn Omar who died, without his having had relations with her, and without determining a dowry for her. As the mother of this woman demanded her daughter's dowry, Abdallah Ibn Omar replied that he refused it, moreover "if she had any entitled to a dowry, we would not have touched it, and we would not be detrimental to it, says Abdallah. The mother insisting on this right, Zaid Ibn Thabet was summoned to judge on this subject; he says, that she has no right to a dowry, but on the other hand has a right to an inheritance”. 
(1120) 11 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz, during his caliphate, expressly ordered his prefects, that any man, father or other, giving a girl to marry, must formulate the amount of a dowry, which is the right of the woman , if she wishes. Malek said, "A girl given by her father, for a marriage, in such a way that he makes a donation to them with the dowry, this donation is considered at the end of a marriage contract, the girl can claim it if she wants, even if her husband had left her, and even before he is actually her husband, her husband will be entitled to half of this donation forming part of the contract”. - Malek also said: “A man who will marry, still young his son, and that this last does not have goods, it is with the father, in this case to be in charge of the dowry, if his son, the day of his marriage does not own any property. But, if the son has property, it is he who must formulate a dowry, unless his father had undertaken to take charge of the dowry himself. And this marriage is legal to the son, even if he is so young, and that he is under the guardianship of the father”. - For the man, sending his wife a virgin, without that he had intercourse with her, and that the father of this woman, renounces half of the dowry, Malek said: "It is permitted to the husband, heir of the father of the woman", he added: “For Blessed Allah and Most High said in His book (the meaning): "Unless they renounce it" meaning by that, the women with whom the husbands have had carnal intercourse, or: "Or that the one who holds the contract of marriage does not withdraw” and it was the father who gave his virgin daughter in marriage, or the master of the slave. And Malek who continues: “This is what is followed in Medina”. - About the Jewish or Christian Woman Marrying a Jew or a Christian, but whether she had embraced Islam, before her marriage, Malek said, "She is not entitled to any dowry." - Malek finally said, "I don't see the dowry of a woman given in marriage, less than a quarter of a dinar, being the minimum value of a stolen object which, by sanction, costs the thief's hand to be cut off”. Chapter IV The lowering of the curtain 
(1121) 12 Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab a reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khat-tab permitted regarding the man marrying a woman, that if the curtains were drawn down (understood that they be alone), the dowry is obligatory”. 
(1122) 13 Ibn Chehab reported that Zaid Ibn Thabet said, "If the man is with his wife, and the curtains are drawn down, the dowry is a right", (ie: let the woman and the man be: husband and wife). (.....) 14 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: “If the man goes to a woman, to her house, we believe him and we deny it. If she enters his house, his house, we believe her, and the dowry will be a right”. - Malek interpreting these words, he replied: "I envisage there, carnal reports: If the man had gone to the woman and that she claimed to be touched, whereas he, will deny this fact, the dowry is not due. But if it was she who went to his house, and he claimed not to have touched her, what she says will be, the dowry is due”. Chapter V The stays of the husband with his virgin (s) or already married (s) wives 
(1123) 15 - Hisham al-Makhzoumi reported from his father that: “When the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had married Oum Salamah, and she had been with him, he said to her: “I will not cause you humiliation. If you want, I will stay for seven days with you, and on the other hand I must stay for another seven days with the others, or, if you want, I will stay for three days and I will do the same for the others”. She replied: “I am for the three days”. 
(1124) 16 - Anas Ibn Malek said: “The man who marries a virgin will stay with her for seven days, and if it is a woman who is already married, it is for three days”. - Malek said, "That's what's tracking." Thereby, for the man who marries a woman, while he has one, after he has devoted a few days to the one he has just married, the other days will be equitably distributed among his wives”. Chapter VI What is not allowed as conditions in a marriage contract 
(1125) 17 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn al-Mussaiab was questioned about the woman who gives her husband the order not to take her out of her country”? He replied, "He can get her out, if he wants to." - Malek said: “What is traditionally followed, when a man gives the woman the order in the marriage contract not to marry another, nor to have captives, that is not too much to consider unless there is an oath of divorce or emancipation, if he will do one or the other, in which case it is his pledge”. Chapter VII Marriage of one who makes a marriage lawful and the like. 
(1126) 18 Al Zoubair Ibn Abdel-Rahman Ibn al-Zoubair reported that Rifa'a Ibn Simwai had divorced his wife, Tamima Bint Wahb, in the time of Allah's Apostle r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) three times. This woman married Abdel-Rahman Ibn Al-Zoubair who could not live with her or touch her, so he repudiated her. Like Rifa'a, her first husband wanted to have her again in marriage, and that he had divorced her, he told the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Su him the grace and peace of Allah) who forbids it by saying to him: "You you will not be able to marry her, before she has tasted the little honey (namely, having carnal intercourse with her second husband). 
(1127) 19 Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that Aisha, wife of the Prophet r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) was asked for (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) about a man who had definitively divorced his wife, the latter being remarried with another who divorced him, without having carnal relations with her. Is it permissible for her first husband to have her again”? Aisha replied: “no, not before he tasted his little honey (i.e. the second husband).

Will he allowed his first to have him again”? Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad replied, "Her first husband has no right to have her." Malek said, "about what is 'lawful', that the man who marries a woman, whom he had previously repudiated, he cannot maintain this marriage until he has married again. If he has consummated this marriage, he will have to pay her her dowry”. Chapter VIII The women you can't have in marriage together

(1132) 24 - Malek reported, according to several say, that Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud was questioned about his opinion while he was in Kufa, about the marriage of the mother. after the daughter, if this one was not touched. He allowed it. Then going to Medina, Ibn Mass'oud went to inquire about this subject of marriage, on which he was told an answer quite different from his own; however that permission was for the case of beautiful girls placed under guardianship. Thus Ibn Mass'oud turning back to Kufa, and even before returning home, he went to the man who had asked his opinion on the subject of marriage (of the mother following the daughter), to whom he ordered him to leave his wife. - Malek said of the man who, marrying a wife, then will marry his mother, his wife will be forbidden to him, and will have to leave them both, having forbidden them together, if he had had relationship with the mother. But, if he had not touched the mother, his wife will not be forbidden to him, but he will leave the mother”. - Malek also said about the man who marries a woman, then marries his mother by having carnal intercourse with her, the mother will not be lawful either for him, or for his father, or for his son, even the daughter of this woman will be forbidden to him and consequently his own wife will be such to him”. - Malek finally said, “However, if it is a concubinage nothing will be forbidden, because Allah Blessed and Most High said: "The mothers of your wives (who are forbidden to you)" Koran IV, 23.. Thus, what is illicit is marriage, without that it be mentioned, that it is concubinage which is illicit (this which is from this verse). Therefore any marriage intended to be granted with a woman who is not prohibited, will be considered licit”. And Malek adds: "That's what I heard being followed in Medina." Chapter X The marriage of a man with the mother of the woman whom he had already touched, in an illicit way (1133) - Concerning the man who fornicates with a woman, upon whom the prescribed penalty was applied, Malek said, "This man can marry this woman's daughter, and again, he can give this woman's daughter in marriage to his son if he wants to, as long as his relations with the woman were illicit. Therefore Allah has forbidden any transgression of the lawful or even what is dubious marriage and He said (meaning): "Do not marry the women whom your fathers had for wives" Koran IV, 22. Malek said, "If a man marries a woman, then that she is during her waiting period, and that this marriage is lawful, so that he had intercourse with her, this woman will be prohibited from it for the son of this man, to marry her because even that her father had legally married her, without being subjected to the prescribed penalty. And the child that this marriage will generate, will belong to the father. Just as this woman was forbidden for her son to marry her, when her father took her in marriage, while she was in her waiting period, and had intercourse with her, the very daughter of this wife will be forbidden to the father if he had already cohabited with his mother. Chapter XI Illicit marriages 
(1134) 25 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) prohibited the marriage known by "Al- Chighar”.

As she got married, while she was in her waiting period, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab struck her with his little whip, did the same for her husband, and separated between them. Then Umar said, "Any woman who has married while in her waiting period, and her husband has not yet had intercourse with her, they will be separated between them, until she has completed the period of her first marriage, after which the other will be considered as a suitor who is willing to become engaged to her. Now, if he had had relations with her, they are separated, then she will have to complete her waiting period of the first marriage and another of the second marriage, and she will not marry this man again”. - Malek reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said on this subject: "And this woman will be entitled to the dowry for the satisfaction which the man allowed himself of her". - Malek added, “What is tracking, about of a free woman whose husband is dead is to live in widowhood for four months and ten days.

Chapter XII Marriage to a slave when one is the husband of a free woman 
(1138) 29 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Abbas and Abdallah Ibn Omar were asked about a man who married a free woman, who wanted to marry a slave? They refused that he had both in marriage

Malek said, "It is not proper for a man free marries a slave, while he can marry a free woman, neither can he marry a slave, being unable to find a free woman to marry, unless he fears depravity. Blessed and Most High Allah has said in His Book: "Whoever among you does not have the means of marrying women who are believers and of good condition, will take believers of captives of war” Coran IV, 25.

He answered: “He can marry her, being a captive of war, and as long as he has not definitely repudiated her. But, in case she had been, he could not marry her, unless she was married to someone else”. - About the man who marries a slave (who was not of his affiliation) and who gives him a child, then he buys it for himself, Malek said: "She is not considered the mother of his child, having given it to him, while belonging to another . But if she will give him a child, she, captive of war but already of his belonging to him, after he has bought her, she will be legally the mother of his child”. - Malek added: "If the man buys himself a captive of war pregnant with him, and she will give birth to a child, she will be considered the legal mother of this child.

And “You are still forbidden two sisters together…” Koran IV, 23. Malek continued: "The man came out of Osman's house, and met one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) whom he asked on the same subject. He answered him: “If this business belongs to me in person, and that I found someone doing that, I should have made him an example (not to be imitated by others, and to chastise him). Ibn Chehab added: "I think this companion was Ali Ibn Abi-Taleb". 
(1145) 36 - It was reported to Malek that al-Zoubair Ibn Al-Aawam was of the same opinion as Ali Ibn Abi Taleb. Malek said, "For the slave woman who belongs to a man who married her, and that he intends to do the same with his sister, the latter is forbidden to him as wife until her sister has been given in marriage to another, or until she has been completely freed from it, or until her freed either executed for the benefit of a sum provided and that by marrying her off with a slave who belongs to her, or belongs to another.

Chapter XVI The ban on marrying the slaves of the people of Livre (1148) - Malek said: "He is not lawful to marry a Jewish or Christian slave, for Allah Blessed and Most High has said in His Book: "The union with women believers and of good condition, and with the women of good condition belonging to the people to whom The Book was given before you” Koran V,5. They are indeed, free Jewish women and Christians. Also, Allah Blessed and Most High said: “Whoever among you cannot afford to marry believing women and in good condition, will take believing captives of war» Koran IV, 25. They are the believing captives». Malek added: “So then I think Allah has permitted the marriage of believing slaves, and prohibited the slaves of the People of the Book, namely, Jews and Christians”. These, Malek continues, are permitted to their masters, being war captives, but it is not permitted to marry a Magus-slave even if she is a war-slave. Chapter XVII Concerning women of good condition 
(1149) 41 - Ibn Chehab reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: “The women said to be of good conditions are those who have given themselves for a legal marriage, and this amounts to the fact that Allah has forbidden fornication. 
(1150) 42 - It was reported to Malek that Ibn Chehab and Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad said: "If the free man marries a slave and has had relations with her, she engages him in marriage". Malek said, "And anyone I've known said similarly, that the slave engages the free man in marriage. If he marries her, having carnal intercourse, she engages him in marriage”. Malek added: “A slave who marries a woman free by having relations with her, he engages her in marriage. But a free woman who marries a slave does not commit him in marriage, unless he is freed, and once he is, she can have him as a husband. But if he separates from her before he is freed, he is not engaged for marriage, waiting for him to be freed and marry a woman (whether free or slave ). - Malek also said: "If a slave woman finds herself the wife of a free man, who separates from her, before he liberated, her marriage to her, cannot make her a woman of good condition, as long as she is not liberated and her husband lives with her after his liberation, and this is the case which engages this slave in the marriage. Yet, a slave married to a free man, and freed while being his wife, even before he separated from her, he makes her a woman of good condition if he separates from her, he makes her a woman of good condition if he releases her as long as she is his wife, and he has had intercourse with her, after 'he had freed him'. - Malek finally said, "The free Christian woman or Jew, and the Muslim slave woman, engage the free man in marriage, if he marries one of them, and with whom, he has had reports". Chapter XVIII The marriage of enjoyment 
(1151) 43 - Ali Ibn Abi Taleb, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbade the marriage of enjoyment, the day of Khaibar, and the eating of the flesh of domestic donkeys”. 
(1152) 44 - Urwa Ibn Al-Zoubair reported that Khawla Bint Hakim returning to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, said to him: “Rabi'a Ibn Omaya made a temporary marriage with a woman and made her pregnant”. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, went out, terrified, dragging his garment and said: “It is indeed the marriage of enjoyment; and if I had not preceded another to decide it, I would have knocked out the author”. Chapter XIX Marriage of slaves 
(1153) 45 - Yahia reported from Malek, that he heard Rabi'a Ibn, Abi Abdel-Rahman say: "A slave can marry four wives (just like a free man)". Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." - Malek also said: "The slave is different from the one who allows himself marriage, if his master allows him to marry (for four times), these marriages are legal, otherwise, the one who allows himself marriage can separate the slave from his wives, annulling these marriages so that they are legally concluded”. For the slave whose wife owns (either by gift, either by inheritance) or for the man who owns his wife, Malek said: “As long as one is the possession of the other, there will be separation and no longer divorce, but if each of them reverts to the other for the purpose of legal marriage, the separation between them will not is in no way considered a divorce”. - Malek finally said, “The woman who owns a slave, and is at the same time her husband, if she releases him while she is in her waiting period, the two separated, one of them can only come back to the other according to a new marriage”.

We cite among others, the daughter of Al-Walid Ibn Al-Moughira who was the wife of Safwan Ibn Oumayya. She had followed Islam on the day of the conquest (of Mecca) when her husband Safwan Ibn Oumayya had fled the land of Islam. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) sent his cousin Wahb Ibn Umair to him, giving him his own garment as security for Safwan Ibn Umayya, and the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) invited him to conversion to Islam and to come and find him, leaving him the choice to respond to this invitation or to have two months to deliberate. When Safwan had arrived, near the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah), putting on his garment, he called to him in front of everyone, saying: “O Muhammad! it is well, Wahb Ibn Oumair who brought me your garment claiming that you summoned me to your side by offering me two choices: either that I respond to your invitation (for follow Islam) or that I have two months to make up my mind". Ship it of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) exclaimed: "Come down, Abou Wahb (nickname of Safwan), the latter replied: “No by Allah, I will not come down until you clear up this matter”.

The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) went on an expedition to Hunain and went down to the Hawazin tribe.

They argued and went to Marwan Ibn Al Hakam who asked the man to swear, the latter declared that he only gave the right of divorce to his wife. for just once.

He married her, however Quraiba's parents reproached Abdul Rahman and said, "We only agreed to this marriage because Aisha took the initiative (in the sense that Quraiba's parents admired the good character of Aisha)”. So Aicha went to bring back this which was said to Abdul Rahman who charged Quraiba with the law of divorce. Having accepted this marriage, she found herself engaged.

Upon returning, Abdul Rahman said: “Can anyone afford to do this to me? Can we to be so indifferent in my opinion”? Aicha spoke about this matter to Al Mounzer Ibn Al-Zoubair who replied: "All that belongs to Abdul-Rahman". There Abdul Rahman says, "I never want to put off any business you have decided." This marriage was granted, without being considered a form of divorce”. 
(1183) 16 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Omar and Abou Houraira were solicited about the man, who giving the right of divorce to his wife, gives it back to her in turn without using it”? They replied: “This is not the case with a divorce”. (.....) 17 - Yahia reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: "If the man grants the right of divorce to his wife, and that this one does not use this right, not even leaving her husband, it is not the case of a divorce" . Malek said: "A woman to whom the husband has given the divorce law, then they separate, without her admitting anything of this fact, the fact of divorcing is no longer up to her, but she can at the rigor to use it as long as they share the same habitat”. Chapter VI The annulment of the marriage was due to the solemn promise made to prohibit relations with the wife 
(1184) 18 - Ja'far Ibn Muhammad reported according to his father that Ali Ibn Abi Taleb said: "When a man undertakes by oath to abstain from his wife, he does not have to keep account of the divorce, even after the lapse of four months (considered for waiting period) as long as this man does not decide this fact. Thus, either he divorces, or he retains his marriage”. Malek said, "That's what's traditionally followed." 
(1185) 19 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: “Any man who makes a solemn promise to deny himself his wife, after the four months have elapsed, he will be judged: either he divorces, or retains his marriage. And he does not have to pronounce the divorce if the four months have passed, unless he is judged”. (.....) 20 - Ibn Chehab reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab and Abou Bakr Ibn Abdul Rahman said about the man who makes a solemn promise to forbid his wife: "If the four months of the waiting period have passed, his wife is already in divorce. And it is up to her husband to bring her back again, in case she is in the waiting period”. 
(1186) 21 - It was reported to Malek that Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam judged the case of the man who made the solemn promise to forbid himself from his wife as follows: "If the four months of the waiting period have passed, she is already repudiated, and that is to him again belongs the fact of having it, as long as it is in the period of waiting”. - Malek said: "And Ibn Chehab shared the same opinion". - Malek on the man who makes a promise solemn to forbid himself from his wife and is judged, then divorces her after the four months (waiting period) is up, and he makes her come back again said: “If this man has not had carnal intercourse with his wife until her waiting period has elapsed, it will never be possible for him to have her, nor to be with her again, unless he presents an excuse of sickness or prison or a similar excuse. In this case having it again is final. On the other hand, if the woman's waiting period elapsed, after which he married her, and he had no intercourse with her until the period waiting either elapsed, the man is to be judged. If he has not taken her again, he is already divorced from her, for his solemn promise to forbid himself from his wife has already been made, since the four months have passed, without he has the right to bring her back. Because, in this case, he married her, then divorced without having had carnal relations with her, consequently, the waiting period is no longer considered, and he does not have to do it come back again”. Malek said about the man who promises solemn ban from his wife, then is judged after the lapse of four months, he divorces her then brings her back without him had carnal intercourse with her, and that the four months had elapsed before the waiting period had already ended (for the case of a pregnancy for example), that this man is not subject to a judgment, and is not required to divorce. On the other hand, if he had sex with her before the waiting period has not been completed, he is entitled to have it again. But if the waiting period has already ended before her husband has had intercourse with her, he cannot, in this case, take her back”. "And that's the best I've heard about it." - Malek also said: “Regarding the man who makes solemn promise to forbid his wife, then divorce her, and that the four months (known as the waiting period) have elapsed before this period has even ended, this is a divorce done for twice, if the man is called to be judged and he has not had relations with his wife. If the waiting period ends before the elapse of the four months, this man's engagement is not taken for a divorce, because the four months after which the woman was to be forbidden to her husband, have passed, without her still being married to him ". Malek added: “He who makes a solemn promise to forbid his wife for a day or a month, then stay there until the four months have passed, this is not taken for a commitment, because it will be considered such, for the one who made a promise, for more than four months. On the other hand, the one who makes a solemn promise to abstain from his wife for four months, or less than that, I do not see that he is subject to a commitment, because of the As soon as this duration has already passed, his commitment is no longer considered, and consequently he will not be subject to a judgment”. - Malek finally said: “He who makes a solemn promise to his wife, to forbid himself from her, until the weaning of his child, this case is not considered as a commitment. And I was informed that Ali Ibn Abi Taleb, asked about this, he did not consider it a commitment”. Chapter VII Of the commitment of the slave (.....) 22 - Malek asked Ibn Chehab about the commitment of the slave" He replied: "It is almost similar to the commitment of the free man, and he will even be an obligation . However, it is only valid for two months”. ChapterVIII About the free man who compares his wife to his own mother's back 
(1187) 23 - Sa'id Ibn Amr Ban Solaim Al-Zouraqi a asked Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad about a man who divorced his wife, if he marries her”.

However, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab gives him the order, that if he ever marries her, that he does not touch her, before making expiation. 
(1188) 24 - It was reported to Malek that a man asked al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad and Solaiman Ibn Yassar about a man who, before marrying his wife, compares her to my mother's back”. They replied, "If he has married her, he will not have to touch her until he make atonement”.

Allah, Blessed and Most High, according to His words, said - about the expiation of the oath of the man who compares his wife to his mother's back: "The freeing of a slave before he touches his wife", “If he does not find it, a fast for two months in a row before he touches his wife, and if he is unable, he is responsible for feeding sixty poor people”. - Concerning the man, who, in different circumstances compares his wife: "On my mother's back", Malek said: "He has only one expiation to make". Now if he says this then atones then repeats it after his first atonement, he must again make atonement”. - Malek added: “Whoever compares his wife to the back of his own mother, then touches her before making atonement, he will have only one atonement to make. Then he forbids his wife until he makes atonement and asks Allah's forgiveness. And that's the best I've heard about it. - Malek also said: - For women who are told: "Be for me like my mother's back” and whether they are forbidden to men, or others who are foster sisters, or relatives, they are all considered under the same conditions”. - This way of divorce is only allowed to men”. - For the words of Allah Blessed and Most High (meaning) "Those who repudiate their wives with the formula: "Be for me like my mother's back", and who go back on what they said" Coran LVIII, v.3. Malek said: “I have heard in the interpretation of this verse, that it is the act of the man who formulates this repudiation and then decides to keep his wife and have intercourse with her. If so, he owes an atonement, but if he divorces her without that he has had relations with her, and without his having decided to keep her, he will not have to expiate. If he marries after that, he will not touch her with her until he makes the atonement of one who compares his wife: “to the back of his own mother”. - Malek said, "The man who formulates such repudiation of his wife (slave), if he wants to have intercourse with her, he must make atonement before he touches her”. - Malek finally said, "This way to divorce is only considered an oath of repudiation if the man wants to cause harm without going back on his oath”. 
(1190) 27 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that he heard a man ask Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair about a man who said to his wife: “Any woman I marry after you, will be for me like my mother's back".

(1191) 28 - Malek reported that he asked Ibn Chehab on the repudiation of slaves according to the formula: "Be for me like my mother's back". He said to him, "They are subject to the same conditions as a free man." * Malek said: * “The slave is considered under the same conditions as a free man”. * “This kind of repudiation is an obligation for the slave, and must on the other hand expiate it by fasting for two months in a row”. * “When the slave compares his wife to the back of his own mother", this is not considered as an oath of repudiation, because if he was going to make the fast which is that of the expiation of two months, just like a free man, he would have to divorce him before he finished his fast". Chapter X About Options 
(1192) 29 - Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that Aisha, the mother of the believers, said, “About Barira there were three judgments, one of which demanded his release. Giving him the choice, she opted to keep her husband. So, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “Patronage is the right of the person who freed”.

Malek said, "If her husband touched her, and she claims to be ignorant, of having had a choice, she is in this case accused, and we do not believe what she claimed of ignorance. And it is no longer up to her to divorce her husband after he touched her.

Freed, she continues, Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet (upon him the grace and peace of Allah) summoned me and said: "I am going to tell you something, and I do not like you to make a decision of your fate. It's up to you to decide, except if your husband touched you. Because, if that's the case, you won't have anything left to decide”.

And if her husband says to her: "I only gave you, for once, the right to to choose, he said, is not to be considered”. And that's the best advice." - Malek finally said, "If her husband gives her a choice, and she's like, "So I accepted only once", and that her husband refuses him saying, "Rather, I give you the choice for three times", and that she shows herself refusing except for one, she stays with him as a bride, and therefore, it is no longer a separation" if Allah wills”.

If she is married, then separated from her husband, without his touching her, she will not have to undergo a second waiting period, and she will take the first period into account”. Malek added, "That's the best I've heard about it." - Malek finally said, "If the woman asks her her husband divorces her by giving her part of his property, on condition that he repudiates her, and that her husband divorces her for three successive times, the divorce is to be considered.

Will he kill this man and face the executive sentence? Or else, tell me, what should he do? Assem ask for me this question to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam)”? Reporting this matter to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) he was repelled and disgusted with such that Assem felt pain from what he had heard from the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), Assem returned to his home, Ouwaimer came to his house and said to him: “O Assem, what was the response of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah)”? Assem replied: "Your question did not bring me any good, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) hated the question I asked him”. Ouwaimer replied, "By Allah, I will not be silent only after asking him the question, personally". Ouwaimer went in search of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) until he found him in the midst of a crowd so he said, "O Messenger of Allah, what do you say about of a man who finds his wife with another man? Will he kill him and then he will have to be executed himself, what should he do”? The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: "A verse has been revealed to me about you and your wife, so go and bring her"! Sahl continued: "The two spouses presented themselves before the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) and took an oath of anathema, while I was present with people. Once they finished their anathemas of reciprocity, Ouwaimer said: "O Messenger of Allah I would have lied, if I had restrained him", so he divorced her by three times, before the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) orders him to do so".

If he contradicts himself, he will be flogged and the child will be attributed to him. He won't be able to have his wife again. And it is the tradition, followed in Medina, which is neither to be doubted nor disputed». - Malek also said: - “If the man separates definitively from his wife, in such a way that he can no longer bring her back, then he refuses her pregnancy, he can accuse her of anathema if she is pregnant and if she claims that it comes from her cohabitation with him, unless it is attested that it comes back to a period which is doubtful, and that the man in being ignorant". Such is the tradition followed, and which I have heard from versed men. - “If the man accuses his wife of infidelity after that he divorced her three times, while she is pregnant, as for him, he admits that this pregnancy comes from him then claims that he saw her fornicate before he separated from her , he will be scourged, and will not have to accuse him of anathema. But if he disavows his wife's pregnancy after he has been divorced from her three times, he must accuse him of anathema". "And that's what I heard." - "And the slave is on an equal footing with the free man, as regards defamation and accusation of anathema. He acts just like a free man with regard to the accusation of anathema, which is not the case with defamation, namely that he is not subject to flogging (in case the 'accused female slave, is in fact innocent)'. - “And the woman let her be a Muslim slave, or a free woman, Jewish or Christian, she may accuse a free Muslim man of anathema if he marries one of them carnal relationships. For Allah Blessed and Most High has said in His Book: “As for those who accuse their wives”, as long as these women are wives”. “And such is the tradition followed”. - “If the slave marries a free woman Muslim or a Muslim slave, or a free Jewish or Christian woman, he must take the oath of anathema". - “About the man who takes an oath anathema to his wife and then goes back on his oath by contradicting himself after one or two oaths, without him calling on the curse of Allah on him for the fifth time, Malek said: "If he returns on his oath before he curses, he must be scourged, and no one separates between him and his wife”. - “About the man who divorces his wife, and who, after three months had passed she confessed to being pregnant, Malek said, "If her husband denies this pregnancy, he must take an oath of anathema." - “Concerning the war captive to whom her husband takes an oath of anathema, then buys her," Malek said, "He must not have intercourse with her, even if she is in his possession, for the sunna requires that two spouses who have sworn oaths of anathema, can never be with each other again”. - "Finally Malek said, 'If the man accuses his woman of anathema before having intercourse with her, she will only have half the dowry”.

Malek said: “And I was told that Suleiman Ibn Yassar was of the same opinion, and this is still what I saw followed by the versed men in Medina”. Chapter XV The Divorce of the Virgin 
(1204) 42 - Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Thawban reported that Muhammad Ibn lyas Ibn Al-Bukair said: "A man divorced his wife for three times before having carnal intercourse with her and then he had wanted to marry her again, so he came to ask about it, versed men and I kept him company. He asked for Abdallah Ibn Abbas and Abu Houraira at this subject, who replied, "We are considering not allowing you to marry her, until she is married to another and then divorced". He went on: "But I only divorced her for a one time". Ibn Abbas said: "You delivered from your hand the best you possessed". 
(1205) 43 - Ata' Ibn Yassar reported: "A man came to ask Abdallah Ibn Amr Ibn Al'As about a man who divorced his wife for three times, before he touched her".

A one-time divorce imposes a new marriage and a new dowry. But the divorce made for three times, the woman will be forbidden to the husband until she is married to another man than her husband (then divorced). 
(1206) 44 - Boukair Ibn Abdallah Ibn Al-Achaj a reported that Mu'awia Ibn Abi Ayash Al-Ansari was sitting in the company of Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair and Assem Ibn Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, when Muhammad Ibn lyas Ibn Al-Bukair came to them and said: "A man of the Bedouins divorced his wife for three times, before he had intercourse with her, so what do you think about him”? Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair said: "We cannot decide this matter, so go to Abdallah Ibn Abbas and Abu Houraira, whom I have just left at Aicha's, and ask them the question then come back to bring us the answer". He left and asked them the question. Ibn Abbas said to Abu Huraira: "O Abu Huraira, answer him, here is a difficult question that has been put to you". Abu Hurairah replied, "A divorce done once, imposes a new marriage and a new dowry, and one that is done three times, will make the woman forbidden to her husband, until she is married from another man than him (and divorced)". Malek said: “Such was the tradition followed in Medina. As for the woman who had already been married to a man without his having had relations with her, she will be treated like a virgin: divorced once, she must marry again and have a new dowry. , divorced three times, she will be prohibited for her husband until she is married to another man than him (and then divorced).

Now, she only had her period once Abdul Rahman fell ill, when she got cleansed, she let him know, so he divorced her permanently or even divorced her once which was the third, because he was sick. Osman Ibn Affan gave him his share of the inheritance when his waiting period was already over”. 
(1210) 48 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Muhammad Ibn Yahia Ibn Habban said: "My grandfather Habban had two wives: a Hashemite and an Ansarian, he divorced the Ansarian so that she was still feeding her baby. A year ended, and this woman did not have her period, and then the man died. She said: “I have the right to inheritance, as long as I haven't had my period”, the two women argued and then went to report the matter to Osman Ibn Affan. Having given the right of inheritance to the Ansarian, the Hashemite blamed Osman who said: "Such was the decision taken by your cousin, who imposed it on us", designating by the cousin, Ali Ibn Abi-Taleb" . (Of the same descent as the Hashemite). (1211) 49" Malek reported that he heard Ibn Chehab say: "If a sick man divorces his wife three times, she will have the right to inheritance". - Malek said: “And if he divorces her, being sick and that before he has relations with her, she will be entitled to half the dowry, to her share of the inheritance and she will have to consider his waiting period. But if he has had relations with her, then he divorces her, in this case, she will be entitled to the full dowry and her share of the inheritance”.

His postage does not change the length of his waiting period, whether she returns or does not return to him, this period is invariable”. * Malek said: *The same is true for the penalty to which the slave is subjected, then that he is freed after he has been subjected to the penalty. For his pain remains that of a slave. - * And the free man definitely divorces slave woman by three pronouncements of divorce, and her waiting period is two menses. As for the slave, he definitively divorces the free woman by two pronouncements of divorce, and his waiting period is three periods”. * For the man who marries a female slave, then who buys it and frees it Her waiting period is two periods, if he has not touched her.

If, during this period, she does not have her period, her waiting period will be for three months. If, before these three months are over, she has her period, she will have to wait for it again. If nine months have passed before she gets her period, she will have a three-month waiting period. If she gets her period for the second time before the three months are up, she will wait for the following. In case the nine months have already been completed before she gets her period, she will have a three month waiting period. If she has her period for the third time, it means that she will have completely completed the three periods. If she doesn't get her period, she should wait three months until she gets married. And in this case, her husband will be able to take her back, before she not marry, unless he had definitively divorced her". - Malek said: “The tradition followed among us, when the man divorces his wife while having the right to take her back, and she has partially passed her waiting period, then he takes her back, and as a result he will separate from her before he does not touch her - it is that the wife will not have to consider what has already passed from the waiting period, and she will start a new waiting period from the day of her divorce, because her husband, having brought back without his needing her, will have committed an unlawful act. * What's tracking among us, when the woman divorced girl becomes a follower of Islam while her husband remains impious then converts to Islam, that he has full right to keep her as long as she is in her waiting period. But if the waiting period has already passed, he will not be able to bring it back.

This is due to the fact that this woman's waiting period took place immediately after her freedom, so her waiting period must be that of a free woman. Malek said, "And such is the rule followed among us." Chapter XXXIV Ejaculation outside the womb 
(1262) 106 - Ibn Muhairiz reported: "I entered the mosque and at the sight of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, I sat down near him and asked him about ejaculation outside the womb? He answered me: "We left with the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) in an expedition against Bani Al-Mustaleq. We took as captives the best women of the Arabs. As we desired women, and as on the one hand we felt the pain of our state of celibacy, on the other, we wanted ransoms in exchange for the captives, we decided to live with them by ejaculating outside the uterus. So we tithes: "Can we do this, without asking the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) since he is among us". We asked him, and he replied, "There is no harm in doing that, but be sure that from here on the day of resurrection, everyone whose life has been decreed will not fail to existence”. 
(1263) 107 - Amer Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas reported that his father ejaculated outside the womb”.

(1266) 110 - Al-Hajjaj Ibn Amr Ibn Ghazia reported that he was sitting with Zaid Ibn Thabet, when a man from Yemen called Kahd came and said: "O Abu Sa'id! I have several female slaves and wives who don't please me more than they, I, don't like my slaves to carry me, can I ejaculate, outside the womb”? Zaid addressing A-Hajjaj said to him, “O Hajjaj, what do you say”? I replied, “May Allah forgive you! I only see you for learn", I replied to the man: "Your wives are like a field for you to plow, you can either irrigate it (make it fertile) or alter it (keep sterile). That's what I heard about Zaid. So he said, "He said the truth." 
(1267) 111 - A man known by the name of Zafif reported that Ibn Abbas was asked about ejaculation outside the womb. He called one of his slaves and said, "Teach them." She was ashamed, he said: "He is such, as for me, I do it", meaning by that, that he was ejaculating outside the uterus". Malek said: "The man will not be able to coitus interrupted with his free wife, unless she allows him to, however he can freely do it with a slave girl. On the other hand, if his wife is the slave of an owner, he can only perform coitus interruptus after having had their permission”. Chapter XXXV rules of mourning 
(1268) 112 - Houmaid Ibn Nafe' reported that Zainab Ibn Abi Salama told him three hadiths, saying: "I was at Oum Habiba, the wife of the Prophet r (On him the grace and peace of Allah) just at the death of his father Abu Soufian Ibn Harb. Oum Habiba brought a perfume containing "Soufra -Khoulouq” or something like that. Then she rubbed this perfume on one of her servants and passed her hand over her cheeks saying: "By Allah, I do not need to wear perfume, however I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam ) (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) say: "It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Day of Resurrection to be in mourning for more than three days, except in the case of her husband, where his mourning should be four months and ten days”. (Such was the first hadith). 
(1269) 113 - Zainab (recounting the second hadith) said: “Then I was at Zainab Ibn Jahch, the wife of the Prophet r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), at the death of her brother, she asked that perfume be brought to her by which she perfumes herself. Then she said, "By Allah, I don't need this perfume, nevertheless, I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say: “It is not the right of a woman who believes in Allah and on the day of the resurrection, to mourn for more than three days, except if the deceased is her husband, where the mourning may cover four months and ten days”. 
(1270) 114 - (During the third hadith) Zainab has said: "I heard Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) say: “A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, my daughter just lost her husband, and her eyes are sore can she coat them with Kohol”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: "No", taking up the “no” for two or three times, meaning by that “A definite no”, then he said: “The mourning is for four months and ten days. And during the pre-Islamic period, one of the women threw a dung after the passage of one year”. Houmaid Ibn Nafe' continued: "I asked Zainab: "Why did the woman throw a dung after the passage of a year"? She replied, "When the wife lost her husband, she lived in a place with poor furniture, and put on ragged clothes, without touching any perfume or anything like that, until a year was up. . Then she asked for an animal, be it a donkey or a sheep or a bird, against the skin of which she rubbed her body. And it was rare that the beast could survive, and then the woman would come out, and they give her a dung, she threw it in front of her, at the as a result of which she could touch perfume or the like”. 
(1271) 115 - Aisha and Hafsa, the wives of the Prophet r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "It is not lawful for a woman believing in Allah and in the day of the last judgment, to mourn for a dead person, for more than three nights except, that the dead person is her husband”. 
(1272) 16 - It was reported to Malek that Oum Salama, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) said to a woman, grieving for her husband, and suffering from pain in her eyes: "Coat your eyes with Kohol at night and remove -the, the day». 
(1273) 117 - It was reported to Malek that Salem Ibn Abdallah and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar said about the woman whose husband dies: "If she risks ophthalmia affecting her eyes, or she is sore from any ailment, she can, if necessary, smear the eyes with Kohol, or even with a remedy, even if a perfume is contained therein”. Malek said, "If he is of a necessity, Kohol or other remedy are allowed there, because religion is easy to practice”. 
(1274) 118 - Nafe' reported that Safia Bint Abi Oubaid suffered from sore eyes, mourning the death of her husband Abdallah Ibn Omar. She didn't use the Kohol although her eyes were going to be closed with dirt. Malek said, "The woman whose husband is lost, can use sesame oil and fat, or other similar products, unless they contain perfume”. Malek also said, "The woman whose husband dies must never put on adornment jewellery, namely a ring, anklet or other jewellery. She will also not put on clothes with colored fabrics or embroidery, unless these clothes are of coarse fabric or black in color. She won't comb her hair only with lotus or something like that, namely with what will not leave traces on his head”. 
(1275) 119 - It was reported to Malek that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) entered Um Salama then that she was in mourning at the death of her husband Abou Salama. Having put the traces of the tamarind on his eyes, he said to him: “What are you doing, O Oum Salama”? "It's only tamarind, O Messenger of Allah,” she replied. He shot back, "Put it on at night and wipe it off by day." Malek said: "Bereaving, for a woman who has not yet reached the age of puberty, on the death of her husband, is the same as that of an adult woman, and will even have to forbid herself from all that an adult woman is forbidden from”. Malek said again: “A slave woman, will be in mourning, at the death of her husband, for two months and five nights, the duration of her waiting period”. Malek finally said, "A mother slave, don't will not be in mourning at the death of her master, and this is also the case of a captive of war at the death of her possessor, because mourning is only an obligation for free women”. 
(1276) 120 - It was reported to Malek that Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "The bereaved woman, comb her hair with oil and lotus, free of any perfume". MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement the Merciful Book 30 The topic of breastfeeding. First chapter Infant breastfeeding 
(1277) 1 - Amra Bint Abdul Rahman has reported that Aisha, the mother of believers taught her that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was at home when she heard a man asking for permission to enter Hafsa's house. Aisha said, “O Messenger of Allah! He there is a man asking to be allowed to come into your house”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "I see that he is so-and-so, a paternal uncle to Hafsa by nursing relationship". Aisha replied, “O Messenger of Allah! If such a man, my paternal foster-uncle, were alive, could he come into my house? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: "Yes certainly, because the lactation relationship imposes the same prohibitions as childbirth”. 
(1278) 2 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that Aicha, the mother of believers said, “My paternal uncle by milk came to ask permission to enter my house. But I refused to allow him to enter, before asking the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) on this matter. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) having come, I asked him and he replied: "It's your uncle, you could allow him to enter". I said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! But it was a woman who breastfed me and not a man! He replied, "He is your uncle, let him come into your house." Aicha said, “It took place after the revelation of the verse concerning the veil" finally she said: "Breastfeeding is for the same prohibitions as childbirth". 
(1279) 3 - Ourwa Ban Al-Zoubair reported that Aicha, the mother of the believers taught her that Aflah, brother of Aboul-Kou'ais came to ask her permission to enter her home, he who was her brother by breastfeeding, and that after the verse of the veil had been revealed”. She said again, “But I refused to let him in. But when the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) entered, I told him told me what I had done, and he ordered me to let him in. 
(1280) 4 - Thawr Ibn Zaid Al-Daili reported that Abdallah Ibn Abbas said: “even if it is a single suction, in two years it will make breastfeeding relatives prohibited for marriage”. 
(1281) 5 - Amr Ibn Al-Sharid reported that Abdullah Ibn Abbas, when asked about a man who had two wives, one of whom had suckled a boy and the other a girl, if this boy can marry this girl"? He answered; “No, because the husband is the same”. 
(1282) 6 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "Breastfeeding is only allowed to those who have had it, as infants, and is forbidden to adults". 
(1283) 7 - Nafe' reported that Salem Ibn Abdallah Ibn Omar told him that Aicha, the mother of the believers, sent him when he was small, to his Sister Oum Kulthoum Bint Abi Bakr Al-Siddiq, telling her: "Breastfeed him with ten complete meals so that, once he is great, he can enter my house, without permission». Salem added: “Oum Kalthoum breastfed me for three meals and then fell ill without her being able to complete the ten planned meals. Thus, I could not enter Aicha's without her permission, because Oum Koulthoum had not breastfed me for ten meals”. 
(1284) 8 - Nafe' reported that Safia Bint Abi Oubaid told him that Hafsa, the mother of believers had sent Assem Ibn Abdallah Ibn Sa'd to her sister Fatima Bint Omar Ibn Al-Khattab to breastfeed him for ten meals, while he was still an infant. so that he could later, grown up, enter her home without his permission. Fatima having done so, Assem entered Hafsa's house, without having permission”. 
(1285) 9 - Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported that his father told him that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Be upon him peace of Allah) brought into her home, without permission, those whom her sisters and her brother's daughters had breastfed, which was forbidden for those who have been nursed by the wives of his brothers”. 
(1286) 10 - Ibrahim Ibn Ouqba reported that he asked Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab, about breastfeeding”? Sa'id replied, "All lactation does, even if it is from a drop of milk, in the first two years, imposes a ban. However, what is given beyond two years is considered only food to eat”. Ibrahim Ibn Ouqba added: “Then asking Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair on the same subject, he gave me the same answer as that of Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab. 
(1287) 11 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he has heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab say: "Breastfeeding is only necessary for an infant in the cradle, because beyond this period, food is more valuable for the development of the flesh and the bone". (.....) 12 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab said: "Breastfeeding, whether for a short period or a long period, imposes prohibitions". - Yahia reported and I heard Malek say: “Any breastfeeding whether quantitatively little or too much, in the first two years, imposes prohibitions. But, after this period, the breastfeeding of a large quantity either it or a small one, will not prohibit anything, because it is taken for food”. Chapter II Breastfeeding the big 
(1288) 13 - Malek reported that Ibn was asked Chehab about breastfeeding the big one. He replied: "Ourwa Ibn Al Zoubair told me that Abu Houzaifa Ibn Utba Ibn Rabi'a, who moreover was one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) with whom he had attended the battle of Badr, had adopted Salem known as Salem, the freedman of Abu Houzaifa just as the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had done for Zaid Ibn Haritha. Abou Houzaifa, taking Salem as his son, marries him from the daughter of his sister Fatima Bint al-Walid Ibn Utba Ibn Rabi'a, who at that time was one of the first women who had made the hijrah, and was one of the most beautiful single women in Quraish. Immediately Allah Most High revealed in His Book the following verse: "Call these adopted children by the name of their fathers, it will be more just with Allah, but if you do not know their fathers, they are your brothers in religion, they are yours» Koran XXXIII, 5. Each of these adopted children were called in the name of his real father, and in case the latter was unknown, the child would be known by the name of his father who had adopted him. Thus, Sahia Bint Souhail, the wife of Abou Houzaifa who was from Bani Amer Ibn Louay, came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! We had considered Salem as a child and being such, he entered my home when I was without a veil having only a one-room house, what do you think about him”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: “Breastfeed him for five meals from your breast and you will be prohibited”. “And she took him from then on for a suckling son. Aisha, the mother of the believers, being aware of this fact, she followed him with all those whom she wanted to bring into her home without their permission. So she asked that this be followed by his sister Oum Kalthoum Bint Abou Bakr Al-Siddiq and by his brother's daughters, for those whom they liked to bring into their home without let them take their permission. As for the other wives of the Prophet (upon him the grace and peace of Allah) they refused to let at home, those who have been breastfed in this way, without giving them permission and said, “No, by Allah! What the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered Sahia Bint Souhail to to do, was only such a particular authorization, so that she breastfeeds Salem alone. No, by Allah! We will not allow any man to enter our house, having been nursed in this way”. This was the way of acting, wives of the Prophet (upon him be Allah's grace and peace) concerning the breastfeeding of the grown-up". 
(1289) 14 Abdallah Ibn Dinar reported: “A man came to find Abdallah Ibn Omar, whom I accompanied in the court of justice, asking him about the breastfeeding of the big child? Abdallah Ibn Omar answered him: “A man came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab saying to him: “I had a slave with whom I lived, my wife had breastfed her, wanting to have intercourse with the slave, my wife exclaimed: Take care, for, by Allah, I have breastfed her”. Omar, thus, says: “Tease your wife, and have intercourse with your slave because breastfeeding imposes prohibitions only if it is proper to infants. 
(1290) 15 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that a man said to Abu Moussa Al-Ach'ari: "I sucked my wife's breast and I swallowed the milk". Abou Moussa answered him: "I think that your wife is forbidden to you". Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud said: “Pay attention to what you have just said to the man” Abou Moussa replied: “what are you saying to yourself”? Abdallah Ibn Massou'd replied: "Breastfeeding does not impose prohibitions only if given during the first two years of the infant'. Abou Moussa then said: "don't ask me any more questions, as long as this scholar is present". Chapter II Everything about breastfeeding 
(1291) 16 - Aisha, the mother of the believers reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Breastfeeding calls for the same prohibitions as those of childbirth. (1292) 17- Aicha, the mother of believers reported that Joudama Bint Wahb Al-Assadia taught her that she heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him and the peace of Allah) say: "I intended to forbid men cohabitation with their wives and ejaculation, as long as their wives were still breastfeeding their infants, when, I remembered that this was done by the Romans and Persians, without harm to their children". - Malek said: "This is, interpreting the hadith above, for the man to have intercourse with his wife while she is breastfeeding". 
(1293) 18 - Amra Bint Abdul Rahman reported that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Among the verses revealed in the Quran, one of them was about the prohibition caused by the ten breastfeedings, then it was reduced to five full meals. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) died, and had recited this verse so much as part of the Qur'an". Malek said, "And we don't follow that among us." MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 31 The sales book First chapter Sale by pawn 
(1294) 1 Amr Ibn Cho'aib reported from his father, according to his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbade the sale by pawn". - Malek, interpreting the hadith above says: "What I think, and Allah is most informed, that for the pledge, it is a question of the fact that the man buys himself a slave, or even that he rents himself a mount, then that he tells the one from whom he bought himself or s is rented: "I will pay you a dinar or a dirham or more, or less than this price, provided that if I keep the goods or use the mount, what I would have paid you as sum will be part of the price of the merchandise, or of the frame; and if I no longer want to buy myself the goods, nor rent the frame, what you would have had as a sum paid, will not be your right”. a - What is tracked among us (in Medina), it is that it is accepted that man buys the eloquent and gifted slave for commercial business in exchange for other Ethiopian slaves or even of other origins who have not not the eloquence of this slave, nor even his commercial skill, nor either his conviction, nor finally his knowledge. Thus, it is permitted to buy this slave, to exchange it for two or more others, for a well-determined time. However, if, later on, it turns out to be different, the slightest comparison that will be underlined is enough for his exchange for two to be canceled even for a limited time. And it is the same for the difference of origins. b - It is tolerated that one can resell what one has bought before taking it, if this price has been collected from another man who is not the one from whom one made the purchase”. c - It is not allowed, in the event of the sale of a woman, to make her exempt from the child she has in her lap, because this is an abused market, by ignoring whether it is a male or a female, whether he is beautiful or ugly, whether he is a complete or incomplete creature, whether he is alive or dead, therefore it will devalue the price of this woman”. d - For the case where a man who buys a slave for a hundred dinars forward, then the seller regrets this sale and asks the buyer to declare the contract void, paying him ten dinars cash or forward, and considering the hundred dinars as canceled, Malek said: “It is valid. But if the seller regrets and asks the buyer to cancel the purchase of the male or female slave, paying him ten dinars cash or term, in surplus, in a date that exceeds the term provided, this is not permitted. In other words, it is as if the seller sold the slave at one hundred dinars for a period of less than a year, and ten dinars in cash or at a term for a period of more than one year. This means that it is the sale of gold against gold that comes into play, at term. e - Concerning man who sells a slave to another, for one hundred dinars, to be paid in time, then he buys her at a price exceeding that of the sale price, for a period beyond that of the term, this is not tolerated . And this is explained by the fact that either the man sells the female slave for a well-determined period, then that he buys it for a period exceeding the first, so that he sells it at thirty dinars at a term of one month and that he buys it at sixty to one. one-year term, or six months. Thus, it is as if his merchandise came back to him as it was, and the other man gave him thirty dinars for a month, sixty for a year or even for six. However, this is not tolerated”. Chapter II The Subject of the Slave's Property 
(1295) 2 - Abdullah Ibn Omar reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said, "Whoever sells a slave possessing a sum saved, this is the seller's right, unless the buyer stipulates it." Malek said, “What is of follow among us (in Medina), is that if the buyer stipulates what slave possesses, it must be returned to him, whether it be cash or in the form of debt or a commodity, determined or indeterminate. And if the slave has a sum of money exceeding that of the price by which he has just been bought, the purchase price of the slave is made either by cash or by a debt or even merchandise. Because, what the slave owns, his master will not have to pay Zakat on his behalf, just like the case where the slave owning a slave can cohabit her by his right of possession. If the slave is freed in a definitive way or in the long term according to a clause, his possession belongs to him, and in the event that he goes bankrupt, his creditors can monopolize his possession, without his master taking responsibility for paying him. his debts, if he has any. Chapter III Warranty 
(1296) 3 - Abdullah Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm reported that Aban Ibn Osman and Hisham Ibn Ismail alluded in their preaching to the guarantee of slavery, within three days of the purchase of the slave (male or female) and the one-year warranty". - Malek said: “What can reach a slave, in the first three days they were purchased, it is the seller who holds the responsibility. Corn if during a year given as guarantee, there would be an attack of madness, or leprosy or the loss of a limb due to an illness, after this year has passed, the seller is exempt from all liability”. - Malek added: “A heir or another who sells a slave without there being a guarantee clause, this seller is no longer responsible for any defect, and he no longer has to keep a guarantee, unless he was well aware of a vice and that he does not admit it. So if he had done so, his indemnity is of no interest to him, and what he had sold must return to him. And this guarantee is only required here (in Medina) when it comes to selling slaves. Chapter IV The disadvantages of slaves 
(1297) 4 - Salem Ibn Abdallah reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar sold a slave he owned for eight hundred dirhams, and Abdallah ibn Umar stipulated that he was not responsible for any fault in the slave. The buyer said to Abdallah Ibn Omar: "This slave is touched by a disease which you did not make known to me". They argued and went to Osman Ibn Affan to decide, the man said: "He sold me a slave with a vice without him admitting it to me", and Abdallah on his part said: "I sold with the stipulation that I was not responsible for any defect in the slave". So Osman Ibn Affan demanded that Abdallah Ibn Umar swear to him that he had sold him the slave free from any vice he knew; Abdallah refusing to take an oath, he took back the slave who, at home, was cured. Then Abdallah sold it again for one thousand five hundred dirhams”. - Malek said: “What is followed up with us (in Medina), in case someone buys a slave, cohabits her and makes her pregnant, or buys a slave and later frees her, or any other case where what is bought does not East more subject to being returned, and that the evidence be put in evidence, namely that what was purchased had been affected by a defect while it was with the seller, or even that the seller admits that there is had such, or that another has witnessed it, it is necessary that the slave, male or female, be valued while taking into account the defect they had, the same day they were sold, the seller will deliver to the buyer a concluded price be split between the true price (the male or female slave considered in a safe and sound condition) and the current price (i.e. that this or that slave have some defect). - Malek also said: “This which is practiced with us (in Medina) in the case where the man buys the slave for himself, then finds him some defect which gives him the right to return him to the seller, but even that this slave while being at the buyer has been affected by another defect, namely, for example, that this defect either or the amputation of one of the members of this slave, or that this last became blind or any other form close to this defect, it is necessary, this case being, that the purchaser has to choose: or that he decreases the price of the slave in view of his vice by a value equivalent to this vice, from the very day on which he had bought him, or if he wants to, that he pay the seller the value of the defect suffered by the slave when he had been in his possession, then return it to the seller. If the slave dies while being with the buyer, its price is estimated at the value it had on the day of purchase, taking into account its default. Thus, if the value of the slave, on the very day of his purchase, and being free from any defect, was one hundred dinars, and that this value, on the day of his purchase with the default, was eighty dinars, the buyer would be given the value of twenty dinars, who would thus have paid four and twenty dinars, the suitable value of the slave, taking into account his default”. Malek said, “He who will return a slave for having found any vice whatsoever in her, but whom he had already cohabited, when she was a virgin, he must, in this case, take into account the reduction in his price for having cohabited her. But if it was previously cohabited, he would not have to take this cohabitation into account and will owe nothing to the seller who had given him the guarantee. - Anyone who sells one or a slave, or even an animal by indemnity, to those who inherit or to others, the seller shall be exempt from all liability concerning any defect found for what he sold, unless he was aware of this defect and that he had not declared it. If this is so, his indemnity will be of no interest to him, and what he had sold must be returned to him”. - In case a slave is sold in exchange for two others, then that there is in one of her, any defect for which, she will be returned, Malek said: "We will make the evaluation of the slave against that he there was an exchange with two others, and we will estimate its price, then we will the evaluation of the two slaves, exempt from the vice which was in one of them, namely that the evaluation will be made by considering the two slaves in a safe and sound state. Then we will distribute the price of the slave, for whom two other slaves had been exchanged, by esteem of their own prices, so that each of them has its true value, taking into account the one that is much safer and safer compared to to another, therefore, we will consider the one with whom we has found the defect, in order to deprive it of its value, however great it or small, to return it to the buyer by compensation, so that each of the two slaves is valued according to its true price, the day of its sale”. - About the man who buys a slave and employs him on a long-term or short-term basis for wages and food, then finds any fault in him and thereby returns him, his buyer will have his wages and his food. And such was the rule followed in Medina. Else hand, if a man buys himself a slave who builds him a house whose value is worth several times that of the slave, then he finds in the latter any defect allowing him to return it and to have its price again; the slave in this case, will have no wages for the construction which he had made, and such will be its situation if one had made it work with another person, since the salesman had guaranteed it against all vice. And such is the rule followed with us (in Medina). - For the man who buys several slaves in a single batch of a single transaction, and among which, it turns out that a slave has been stolen (before he takes possession of it) or that he is even affected by some defect , this man will have to fix the price of what has been stolen, or of what is affected by a vice, and if this slave is the most expensive or the best among the others, or even that it is because of him, that the transaction has been made, or that people have had no esteem for him, this transaction will be completely canceled. But if it happens that a slave has been stolen or reached with a defect other than the first slave, without having his qualities, this slave alone will be returned by handing over its price once it has been estimated". Chapter V The female slave sold while being subject to a condition 
(1298) 5 - Oubaidallah Ibn Abdallah Ibn Utba Ibn Mass'ud related that Abdallah Ibn Mass'ud bought himself a slave from his wife Zainab Al-Thaqafia, who gave it on condition of reselling it to him at the same price which will be offered on the day of the sale, Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud asked on this subject, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab who said to him: "you will not be able to touch this slave, as long as its sale is subject to one condition”. 
(1299) 6 - Nafe' a reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "Man should not cohabit with a slave, except that he can sell her, that he can make a donation of her, that he can even retain her, or even that he can do with her whatever he wants. - Malek said: "Concerning one who buys a slave on condition that he has neither the right to sell her, nor to make a gift of her, nor to do anything else likewise, its buyer is not allowed to cohabit it, consequently, he will not even have the right either to sell it, or to offer it as a gift, as long as it is not absolutely his. own possession because there is a condition which deprives him of disposing of this slave in full, thus, such a sale is to be detested”. Chapter VI The prohibition that a man live with a slave who already has a husband 
(1300) 7 - Ibn Chehab a reported that Abdallah Ibn Amer had offered as a present, a slave to Osman Ibn Affan, having a husband, and that he had bought her in Basra. Osman told her, "I won't touch her until she separates from her husband." So Ibn Amer got along with the husband of this slave compensated him, and he parted from her”. 
(1301) 8 - Abu Salamah Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Awf reported that Abdul Rahman Ibn Awf bought himself a slave, finding that she was married, he returned her”. Chapter VII Of the sale of fruit trees and their fruits 
(1302) 9 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever sells pollinated date palms, the fruits go to the seller, unless the buyer stipulates so, in the conditions of purchase”. Chapter VIII Of the ban on selling fruit before it begins to ripen 
(1303) 10 - Ibn Omar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) forbade the sale of the fruits before they start to ripen. And this prohibition was to be followed by the seller and the buyer”. 
(1304) 11 - Anas Ibn Malek reported that the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbade the sale of the fruits before they are coloured'. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) was asked r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) about what he means by colorful? he answered: "let them blush" and he added: "What do you think, it is possible that Allah does not allow the fruits to ripen, one of you will he have the right to take his brother's money for free? 
(1305) 12 - Amra Bint Abdul Rahman reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbade the sale of the fruits as long as one doubts their ripening”, (eu escaping the plagues). Malek said: “The sale fruits before they are completely healthy from diseases that could destroy them is considered a random sale”. 
(1306) 13 - Kharija Ibn Zaid Bint Thabet reported that Zaid Ibn Thabet, his father, sold the fruits only just at the appearance of the pleiad (namely, only at this time, we can distinguish the color of the fruits, especially if they are dates". - Malek said: “what is practiced with us (in Medina), concerning fruits such as watermelons, cucumbers, Khirbiz and carrots, is that their sale is permitted in case they are ripe and good to eat then, the buyer will have , all rights over what grows on the trees until they lose all their fruit or are no longer edible, and this for a period which is not to be fixed, because it is a period which has been agreed upon by the people. But if ever these fruits are damaged, and that they are no longer in a state to be consumed, even before the period previously provided for in this way, if this is the case, and that at least a third of these fruits have deteriorated, we must give the buyer a discount equal to or greater than one third, depending on the case. Chapter IX From the sale of “Al-Aryya”^ 
(1307) 14 - Zaid Ibn Thabet reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) allowed the recipient of a date tree tells Arya to sell its fruit, while being on the tree, after estimation, against already picked fruit”. 
(1308) 15 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) tolerated the owner of the "Al-Arya" (a kind of dry date) that their fruits are sold while they are still on the tree, exchanging them for fruits picked, in case the weight is less than five “awsouqs”. Daoud doubts whether it is five awsouqs or less. - Malek said: “the Al-Arya” date palms are sold by estimating their dates, namely that we will consider approximately and we will estimate the dates both they are on the trees. And this tolerance is due to the fact that dates are held in the same way as a charge, or a resolution of a contract or even an association. If the dates were considered like any other merchandise, no one, in this case, will have accepted that another does not share them with him, before he takes possession of them, or before he rescinds a contract, or even even if he charges someone else with it, before he has fully received the price”. Chapter X Of the scourge that ravages fruits and crops 
(1309) 16 - Muhammad Ibn Abdul Rahman heard his mother, Amra Bint Abdul Rahman say: "a man, in the time of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah), had bought himself the fruits of a garden, which he maintained well, until a plague ravaged the fruits of this garden. This man asked the owner of the garden either to forgive him of his debt or to cancel the contract, the owner of the garden, taking an oath not to make either such or such, the mother of the buyer went to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) to inform him of this subject. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's favor and peace) said: "Has he taken an oath to no longer do good”? The owner of the garden, hearing this, came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! The choice is his”. 
(1310) 17 - It was reported in Malek that Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz demanded that we subsidize the value of the fruits, or of the harvest, damaged by a plague”. - Malek said, "And such is the rule followed at home (in Medina)." - Malek has added: “This subsidy will only be made if the deteriorated part or quantity is one-third of the harvest”. Chapter XI Permission to hold a bumper crop party 
(1311) 18 - Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman reported that Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad, was selling fruits from his garden, excepting a part”. 
(1312) 19 - Abdullah Ibn Abi Bakr reported that his grandfather Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm sold the fruits of a garden he owned called "Al-Afraq", to four thousand dirhams, and kept a quantity of dates aside, worth eight hundred dirhams". 
(1313) 20 • Muhammad Ibn Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Harith reported that his mother, Amra Bint Abdul Rahman sold her fruits, keeping aside a certain quantity”. - Makk says, “What is followed by us (in Medina), is that, by selling the fruits of his garden, the man has the right to keep aside a quantity of these fruits, which is not beyond the third , but that this quantity is more than the third, this is not allowed”. - Malek added: “He is not forbidden for a man to sell the fruits of his garden, putting aside a certain quantity of these fruits, namely the fruits of one or more date palms that he chooses, citing their number. Because, the owner, by setting aside some trees, he wants to keep their fruits for him, and not sell them, preferring to sell other fruits from his garden. Chapter XII The sale of dates which is not permitted 
(1314) 21 - Ata'Ibn Yassar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Dates in exchange with other dates, equal for each other”. He was told: "Your prefect at Khaibar": exchanges one Sa' of dates for two". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: "Do you exchange a Sa'de dates against two (namely dates)”? The prefect answered: “O Messenger of Allah, those who sell me, do not give me a sa' of dates of a good quality for a sa' of an inferior quality”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) ordered him: "To sell the dates of various qualities exchanged against money, then to buy with this money dates of good quality". 
(1315) 22 - Abu Sa'id Al Khudri and Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had designated in Khaibar a man who had brought him dates called "janib" (which are of good quality). The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: “Are all the dates of Khaibar, are they of the same quality”?. The man replied, "No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, the sa' of such dates is exchanged for two, and two Sa's against three”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said to him: "Do not do this any more, sell dates of different qualities and take money in exchange, then buy from this money, janib”. 
(1316) 23 - Zaid Abu Ayach reported that he asked Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas about exchanging barley for rye”? Sa'd said to him, "which is more valid"? Zaid replied, "That's barley." Sa'd forbade him and said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the mercy and peace of Allah) say about the exchange of fresh dates for the dry ones: "Fresh dates, once dried, will they lose weight"? He was told yes, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbids this kind of exchange”. Chapter XIII From the "mouzabana" and "al-mouhaqala" 
(1317) 24 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was against “al-muzabana”. Al “Mouzabana” is the act of selling dates on the date palms for dry dates, and selling grapes on the vines for raisins”. 
(1318) 25 - Abu Sa'id Al Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) refuted "the muzabana" and "the muhaqala”. And “la mouzabana” is the sale of dates on the date palms for dry dates, and “la mouhaqala” is the fact of renting the land in exchange for a quantity of wheat”. 
(1319) 26 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) forbade "the muzabana and the muhaqala” (see hadith above), emphasizing that “muhaqala” is either the sale of the harvest in exchange for wheat, or the fact of renting the land in exchange for wheat”. Ibn Chehab, asked Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab about the leased land for gold and silver, Sa'id replied, "It is permitted." Malek said: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) forbade "the muzabana" and "the mouzabana” which is explained as follows: “Any form of sale is said to be random as long as during the sale the weight, measure and number are unknown. By way of example, a man possessing food whose weight cannot be specified, such as wheat or dates or anything similar to them, or even possessing wheat, or fresh dates, or vegetables, or safflower, or of linen, or of cotton, or of silk or that which is similar to them, in short, that he possesses them everything of which neither the weight nor the number can be specified, and that a man comes to say to the possessor of all this merchandise: "Weigh this merchandise, or ask someone to do it, or weigh what may be weighed, or even counted what can be counted; thus if what is measured from such and such lacks a sa', or even if what is weighed from such and such lacks a certain weight, or even what is counted from such and such is lacking, in short all that is missing, I will take it at my expense, whatever the goods designated; and if there is a surplus of this merchandise, I will take it without paying the price. Thus, I guarantee that what is lacking of this commodity is my possession, and is even equivalent to what is surplus. However, this is not a sale but it is a sale of risk, chance and wear and tear, because during this sale, he does not pay the price of a well known and specified commodity, which he bought, but he at least guaranteed himself to have what is said of measure, weight and number, of this merchandise by taking possession of what was in surplus. But if this merchandise lacks what is of these units (measure, weight, number), the one who bought it, should have taken from the owner of this merchandise, what is priceless, or even what is a gift, of which , in fact, he does not have the right to have it because that is usury, or something similar to it". - Malek said, “He is cause the man to say to the other possessing the fabric: I guarantee you that with such fabric, you will have to make such a number of caps, in such a way that each one will be of such and such unit of measurement, that it cited. If it is less than the designated piece of cloth, I will give you what is missing so that you have the full number, and if there is more, it will come back to me”. - Or again, always about the fabric, let the man say to the other: I guarantee you to make of such fabric, such number of shirts, each of which will be of such and such length; but if this fabric is missing, I will give it to you so that you have the number, and if there is more, you will give it to me». - Or again, that the man say to another, concerning leather, whether of cows or camels: "I assure you to cut this leather, in order to make it according to this pattern a hundred pairs of sandals, if the number is less than a hundred, I will complete it for you, and if it is more, this superfluity I will have it free because I guaranteed it”. - Or again, that the man say to the other who has seeds of "ban" (Egyptian willow): "By pressing this ban, you can extract such and such a weight of perfumed oil, or if the weight is less, I will give you what lack, and if there is more, I will have it for myself”. “Thus, all these forms of sale are “la mouzabana”, in other words, sales that are neither permitted nor tolerated”. It will be the same in case the man says to the other, possessing leaves of trees, or stones, or flax, or cotton, or safflower, I will buy such and such a kind of your merchandise. , by Sa', proceeding just as it was mentioned in the previous hadiths, everything comes down to what is quoted from the muzabana”. Chapter XIV The sale of fruit 
(1320) 27 - Malek said: "Let a man buy dates from palm trees, or from a designated garden, or let him buy milk from certain definite sheep, so that that the buyer takes what he has bought, as soon as he has paid the price, this presents no prohibition. This is similar to the case where a man buys oil from a wineskin, at the price of one or two dinars, thus giving his money and signaling to the seller to weigh him some oil from this same skin, there is no prohibition. But in the event that the skin splits and its oil leaks, the buyer will take back his money, and consequently there will be no obligation to sell between him and the seller”. "But what is for any merchandise that is bought at the same time such as milk that is milked, or dates that are picked, namely that the buyer can have them on a day-to-day basis, it is a purchase that is tolerated, since the quantity purchased is well known; but in case it is ravaged before the buyer takes possession of it, or the seller keeps the price of the goods already sold, or the buyer gets the difference of the sum of money already paid, at the price of another commodity after having agreed with the seller on this subject, and that this takes place at the same time, before the buyer and the seller are separated because in this case this is not tolerated. Because, if the separation took place before they both agree, this is refused because the goods in question are subject to the payment of a term sum, but it is forbidden for goods to be delivered after a certain time. Therefore, a transaction is tolerated if the goods are submitted for a certain time already fixed, thus, the seller will guarantee to the buyer the delivery of the goods without it being necessary to specify whether, for example, they are dates from a well-designated garden, or well-defined sheep's milk". Malek was asked about a man who buys dates from a garden of different kinds of palms namely "from Ajwa, from Kabiss, and from Azq", and other kinds of dates, that the seller makes the With the exception of a few date palms, Malek replied, "That is not tolerated, for by doing so he would have taken a measure of fifteen sa's from the 'ajwa' against a measure of ten sa's from the Kabiss, preferring such kind to such another, namely that "the ajwa" is less valid than "the Kabiss". His case is similar to one who, having a quantity of dates, neither measured nor weighed, will make three batches of them: the first consisting of fifteen sa's of "ajwa", the second of ten sa's of "Kabiss", and the third of twelve sa's of "azq", that the buyer subscribes the seller for one dinar, provided that he himself chooses the batch of dates» , this is not allowed, added Malek». - Malek, was questioned, about the man, who having paid a dinar in advance, to the owner of the palm trees, so that he could buy fresh dates, then for any cause whatever, that the palm trees are devastated, he answered: “Let the buyer make his account with the owner of the palm trees, then that he has what is his right of the dinar already paid; and that depends on three cases: if he had bought fresh dates at the price of two-thirds of the dinar, he is entitled to the remaining third; if the dates bought fresh were at the price of three-quarters of the dinar, he will have the remaining quarter, or else that they have agreed, buyers and owners among themselves, namely that he can, if he wants to, buy at the price that remains to him, fresh dates, or other merchandise than dates. This, on the condition that they cannot be separated from each other, before the buyer has received from the owner either the dates or another commodity. - Malek added: “This case above is similar to the same situation where a man lends to another either his horse by renting it to him, or his servant to make work at a dressmaker's or a carpenter's or to do any other work for him, or even though he rents his house to her, so that the first has in advance the payment of the labor of the servant, or the hiring of the house, or the mount, after which an accident of death, or of that which is unforeseen, arises. Thus, it is necessary that the owner of the mount, or of the slave, or of the house return to the other man the price paid in advance for the mount, the slave, and the house, for a sum relatively suitable to what has already been used up of what is rented, which for example is an amount of the half a little less or a little more”. - Malek said about of this advance: "It is tolerated only if the object which is subjected to it, is well known and determined to know a mount, a slave, or a house that is delivered just on payment of the advance, without there being neither delay nor delivery at a certain time. The interpretation of the refusal of this payment in advance is clearer in the following case: "Let a man say to another: I will pay you this amount in advance for your mount, which I will use to perform the pilgrimage, whereas a good time still separates him from the intended pilgrimage, or the same for his slave or his house. This done, it is as if the one who pays in advance was going pay money, because if it happens that the mount is still in good condition in order to use it for the pilgrimage, this mount is rented to him, and if it is no longer due to death or other reason, the owner of the mount must return to the man the sum paid, from which he had in any case benefited". And Malek added: “Now, there is a distinction to be made between this fact above (advance payment returned) and the fact of receiving a sum definitively. Whoever receives the price of what he has rented is no longer accused of a random sale, because it is payment in advance, for a known thing. This case is similar to the man who buys a slave, so he appropriates them and pays their prices immediately, if any incident will affect them during one year of their possession, their owner can have again the amount paid, from the seller; so, for this case, there is no harm; moreover, such was the sunna followed for the slave trade. Malek finally said: “He who hires a known slave, or a well-appointed mount, which will be delivered to him at a fixed date, this is not permitted, because, by this act, he will have paid a sum for a thing which is not in his possession on the day of payment and which the owner can only guarantee on the day of delivery. Chapter XV The sale of fruit 
(1321) 28 - Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina) is what follows: The one who buys fruits, fresh or dried, can only sell them after having paid their (purchase) price. He can only sell them, exchange them from hand to hand. Fresh fruits that can be dried , and do even a provision and consume them dry, such fruits will not be sold from hand to hand or such fruits against such others if they are of the same species. If they are of different species, it is tolerated that two quantities are sold for one, from hand to hand, and without any delay. If there are fruits which cannot be dried or stored, but which are eaten fresh, such as watermelons cucumbers, carrots, oranges, bananas, and pomegranates and any other such fruit, so that, even if dried, they are no longer considered fruit, nor of what one can stock up and they are fruit, I think one can sell a quantity for two and from hand to hand on the market even without it being a term”. Chapter XVI The sale of minted and powdered gold for silver 
(1322) 29 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) allowed the two Sa'ds (namely Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas and Sa'd Ibn Oubada) the sale of the vases of the booty, made of gold and silver selling three vases against four measures of pieces, or four vases against three measures of pieces, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to them: "You have committed the usury, this sale must be returned”. 
(1323) 30 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: “One dinar is worth another, and one dirham is worth another, without any preference from one to the other”. 
(1324) 31 - Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Do not sell gold exchanged for gold, unless one is worth the other, and one of you don't give more than the other. Do not sell either, silver exchanged for silver unless one is of the same value as the other, and one of you does not give more than the other. Do not sell a commodity present against another absent (or non-existent). 
(1325) 32 - Mujahed a reported: “He was at Abdallah Ibn Omar, a jeweler came to tell him: “O Abu Abdul Rahman, I work gold, I sell it more than its weight, thereby earning the value of my work”. Abdallah forbidding him to do this, the jeweler kept repeating the same subject and Abdallah for his part forbade him, until he was at the door of the mosque, or even near a mount to be mounted, then Abdallah Ibn Omar said to him: “The dinar against another, the dirham against another, without preference from one to the other. Such was the commitment of our prophet (on him the grace and peace of Allah) towards us, and such will be ours for you”. 
(1326) 33 - Malek Ibn Abi Amer reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said to Osman Ibn Affan: “Do not sell the dinar for two, nor the dirham for two”. 
(1327) 34 - Ata Ibn Yassar reported that Mu'awia Ibn Abi Souffian sold a gold or silver vase, where water is cooled, at a price higher than his weight. Abu Al-Darda said to him: "I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) prohibit such a sale unless it is made, by equivalence of weight”. Mou'awia replied: "I don't find anything wrong with that." Abu Al-Darda resumed: "Mu'awia answers me according to his opinion, whereas I have just reported to him a hadith according to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and the peace of Allah); to whom do I owe my apologies? I refuse to find me in the same country where you are". Then, going to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, Abu Al-Darda told him what had happened; so Omar Ibn Al-Khattab sent in writing to Mu'awia: "avoid such a sale, unless it is made at equivalence of weight". 
(1328) 35 - Abdullah Ibn Omar reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said, “Do not sell gold against the other, except at equivalence, and without preferring one to the other. Do not sell silver for silver except in an equivalence, and without preference from one to the other. Do not sell silver for gold if one of these two metals is present while the other is not. If one of you asks the other for a certain time so that he can return home, he should not grant it to him, for I fear for you the practice of usury”. 
(1329) 36 - The hadith above, was narrated by Abdallah Ibn Dinar from Abdallah Ibn Umar”. 
(1330) 37 - Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "a dinar against a dinar, a dirham against a dirham, a sa' against a sa' and not to sell a present object against another which is not ". 
(1331) 38 - Abu Al-Zinad reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Mous-saiab say: “Usury is only in the sale of gold or silver, of what is measured or weighed, of what is to be consumed or drunk”. 
(1332) 39 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Mousaiab say, "The exchange of gold and silver is corruption in the world of the living." - Malek said: “There is no no harm in a man buying gold for silver, and vice versa, whether it is gold powder or wrought articles. On the other hand, concerning dirhams and accounting dinars, it is not suitable for a person to buy them, as long as he does not know the nature and the number of these coins. If we buy them at a fixed price, we will have practiced usury, from the moment that we have neglected to count them, for therefore it is not a sale practiced by Muslims. But there's no harm in selling what's weighed gold dust or jewels worked, which is not the case, if one wants to buy them with fixed price. For it is considered as wheat, dates, and like them other foods that can be eaten. sell on credit, as long as they are weighed or measured". Malek finally said: "Whoever buys with dinars or dirhams, a Koran or a sword or a ring, encrusted with gold or silver, the value of the item purchased will be estimated by fixing the value of the precious material as well if the article is valued by two thirds and the precious material is by one third, this is tolerated, provided that the purchase is made on the field, and without any delay; It is the same for the article bought with the money”. “And such is, from time immemorial, the rule followed among us (in Medina)”. Chapter XVII The subject of change 
(1333) 40 - Ibn Chehab reported that Malek Ibn Aous Ibn Al-Hadathan Al-Nasri was looking for a change with someone one hundred dinars. Malek continued: “Talha Ibn Oubaidallah summoned me, and made me the exchange, taking the dinars in hand, then said to me: “Wait until my cashier comes back from “Al-Ghaba” so that I can change them for you. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab listening to us, said: "By Allah, you will not leave him until you have cashed your money", then he continued: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "exchange the gold for money is usury except from hand to hand!”, so wheat against wheat is usury except from hand to hand!”, even dates against dates, subject to usury except from hand by hand!" and barley against barley where there will be usury, except from hand to hand!”. - Malek said: “If the man changes dirhams for dinars, then finds that one of the dirhams is falsified, and intends to return it, all the change is at cancel, and everyone will take back their change". The interpretation of the refusal of this change is due to the fact that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Exchanging gold for money, is usury, except hand to hand!”. And Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “And if he asks you to give him some time, so that he can enter his house, do not allow him. If he gives you back a dirham change, after he leaves you, this is taken as a debt or for a sum to be paid at term. Such is the cause, for which this exchange is refused. And Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had refused to sell gold for money, or for food as a whole against a sum to be paid in time, because it is not suitable to sell the same commodity for a same species or of different species if payment is not made on time". Chapter XVIII Of the sale made after a weighing 
(1334) 41 - Yazid Ibn Abdallah Ibn Qusay reported that he saw Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab weighed his gold, pouring it into one of the pans of a balance, and his companion did so in the other pan. As soon as the equivalence between the two trays was made, each of them took the gold from the other”. - Malek said, "What is followed with us (in Medina) for the sale of gold for gold, and silver for silver, is to be made by weighing, namely that one will have ten dinars against eleven others, from hand to hand, if the weight is of an equivalence in the two trays, and even if there is a difference in the number of parts; The case will be the same for silver coins which are dirhams”. ; - Malek also said: “Whoever, exchanging gold for silver, finds that there is a difference in weight as regards the gold exchanged, and in compensation he will give to his companion the difference in silver or with another commodity, the latter must not accept it, because this is refused, to be usury, Thus, if it were tolerated to the first to have the surplus by paying the price, as if he had bought his share, he would be tolerated to buy it for his express price, making the sale lawful. What if the seller was going to give him this exceeding separately, the buyer would not have taken it, not even for the tenth of its real price that he had paid, by tolerating this kind of sale which will only be a certain way of making licit what is illicit, which justifies that it should be prohibited”. - Malek added: "Concerning the man who exchanges pure gold coins by adding them with gold powder of poor quality, against broken gold coins called "Koufia", and who is moreover repelled by people. That the two men make a transaction by this exchange, Malek does not allow it, interpreting this prohibition as follows: "The owner of the pure gold coins added with the gold dust does not seek to profit from these coins provided that he can make the gold powder flow, otherwise the other would not have accepted such a transaction, where he exchanged "his Koufia". This case is similar to a man who wanted to buy three sa's of “ajwa” dates in exchange for two sa's and a moudd of “Kabiss” dates. Telling him that this exchange is not allowed, he offered to give two sa's of “Kabiss” dates, and one Sa' of “hachf” dates, believing thus to make the exchange legal. However, even there, the exchange is not allowed because the owner of the "ajwa" would not have accepted to give him a sa' of such dates for a sa' of hachf, if he did not want to have other dates say "Kabiss" which are more valid To underline another example where a man says to another: "Sell me three sa's of white wheat in exchange for two sa's and a half of brown wheat". The other, answering him, that this is suitable only by exchanging his' by his', the first will have two sa's of brown wheat and one sa' of barley exchanged, thus seeking to return, between: them, the lawful transaction”. Now, even this transaction is repugnant, because the first would not have given a sa' of barley against a sa' of white wheat, if this sa' were exposed alone, however he had agreed to make this exchange, because the brown wheat is superior to white wheat. It is an example similar to what was previously said about gold dust. - Malek has definitely said, "Thus, whatever is gold, silver, or food, in short, , which is not permitted to be exchanged except on equal terms, it is not unsuitable about them, which is added to the goods of good quality, and which, moreover, is well appreciated by everyone, of the goods of mediocre quality, so that the sale is considered lawful; therefore, in doing so, or making lawful what does not is not. As long as what is mediocre has been mixed with what is well appreciated; the seller thereby seeks to convince of the good quality of what he sells”. Chapter XIX Sale at interest and the like 
(1335) 42 - Abdallah Ibn Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever buys food, will not be able to resell it, until he has taken possession of it". 
(1336) 43 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever buys food, must not resell it, before it is in his possession”, thus, he cannot expose for sale a mediocre merchandise, which, if it had been designed to be sold by itself, it would not be bought only because it had been mixed with another commodity of good quality. Now, it is unseemly that gold, silver and food should be sold in this way, therefore, whoever wants to expose for sale a mediocre commodity, let him do it, but by keeping it separate from any other merchandise, with which he is forbidden to mix it. This being done, there is no harm”. 
(1337) 44 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: "It is a fact, that in the time of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) we bought ourselves food (for merchandise); so the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) sent someone to us ordering us to move from the place where we had bought the food, to another so that we resold it”. 
(1338) 45 - Nafe a reported that Hakim Ibn Hizam bought food that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab offered to people. Hakim, having sold this food before he possessed it, and this was learned by Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, he gave it back to him, saying: "never resell a commodity that you have just bought, before it is in your possession". 
(1339) 46 - It was reported to Malek that titles had been given to people from the time when Marwan Ibn Al Hakam was governor, for food originating “Al-Jar”. People having exchanged between them, these titles before the food is in their possession, Zaid Ibn Thabet, and one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) went to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam, and said to him: “O Marwan! How do you make usury lawful? He exclaimed, “I take refuge with Allah! What are you talking about"? They answered him, "About these titles, which the people exchanged with each other, before they possessed the food." So Marwan sent his guards, searching for these titles, snatching them from the hands of the people, and delivering them to their original owners”. 
(1340) 47 - It was reported in Malek that a man wanted to buy food from another, for a certain time. The seller, accompanied the one who wanted to buy food, to the market, showing him different kinds of food, and said, "What kind do you want to buy"? The buyer replied: “How do you sell me what you don't own? Then both went to Abdallah Ibn Omar, telling him what had happened. So Abdallah Ibn Umar addressed the buyer and said: “Do not buy from him, what he does not have? Then addressing the seller, said to him: “Do not sell what you do not own”. 
(1341) 48 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Jamil Ibn Abdul Rahman the muezzin say to Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab: "I am a man who buys with the will of Allah the food vouchers from al-Jar, which are given to people, then I try to resell the food that I myself had guaranteed, at a certain time". So Sa'id said to him, "Are you looking for there, to pay you for this food before you have possessed it”? The other replied that yes, Sa'id forbade him”. - Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina) and which, moreover, is confirmed, is that the person who buys food such as wheat, barley, rye, corn, millet or other grasses oilseeds or what is similar to them, which in fact are subject to zakat, or even what is edible such as oil, fat, honey, vinegar, cheese, sesame, milk or other foodstuffs which are similar to them, the buyer, in the event that he wishes to resell such goods purchased, may only resell it after having possessed it and even paid the price ". Chapter XX Of refusing to sell food, at a certain time (1342)49 - Abu Al-Zinad reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar prohibit the sale, with a certain delay, of wheat for gold, by which, following he s 'will buy dates, even before he has possessed the gold in question'. 
(1343) 50 - Malek a reported that Kathir Ibn Farqad asked Abu Bakr Ibn Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazem about a man who sells food for gold, with some delay in delivery, then he buys with this gold, dates, before he possessed the gold? Abu Bakr was against such a sale and banned it”. (.....) 51 - Ibn Chehab was of the same opinion». - Malek said: "However, Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab, Abu Bakr Ibn Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm, Ibn Shehab, forbade the fact that a man sells the wheat exchanged for gold, with which he will buy dates, and that before he has possessed the gold which is due to him as the purchase price of the wheat. This is explained by the fact that he must buy with gold, the selling price of wheat, with a certain delivery time, dates from another seller than the one to whom he sold his wheat, and that before he owns the gold, then he makes a delegation of debt between the one from whom he bought the dates and the one to whom he sold the wheat, to recover the gold in question, this is tolerated” . Malek said: "I have asked many learned men on this subject, who have all approved of it." Chapter XXI The advance made for the purchase of food 
(1344) 52 Nafe'a reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "It is tolerated that a man advances to another, well-qualified food, at a fixed price, and for a fixed period, except in the case of a harvest whose quality cannot be determined, or dates whose nature cannot be known". Malek said, “What is follow up with us (in Medina), about food advanced, at a fixed price, and made for a delay, and that the delay is over, if the buyer does not find the food requested from the seller, he will cancel this transaction by taking back his silver or his gold, which he had previously paid to the seller, or even the price at its full value. And he won't be able to buy with what he paid for, any goods, until he had the full amount paid. Because, if he takes back other than the sum paid, or if he leaves it with the seller from whom he buys a commodity other than food, he will have bought food even before he possessed it”. Malek continued: “And the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had forbidden the sale of the food before it is delivered (and the seller has taken possession of it). Malek added: “If the buyer regrets this purchase, saying to the seller: "Cancel this sale and I will give you a certain time so that you return to me the sum I paid you, that is not allowed, and men of science disapproved. For as long as the food may be in the possession of the buyer, at the order of the seller, and he has not yet taken it, for the purpose |of canceling it, such food shall be sold to a certain period of time before it is possessed by the buyer'. - Interpreting this, Malek says: “in case the buyer, the deadline ended, refuses the commodity having its price one dinar for a certain time, this is not considered a repeal of the sale-purchase contract, as long as neither the seller has asked for more nor the buyer has given more. And if this surplus is present and it is payable to a certain time, or that the seller and the buyer ask for and give something in addition from which one of them will benefit, this is also not an abrogation. However, it would be repealed if there has been a sale on either side. On the other hand, we tolerated the repeal, association and delegation, as long as they present neither surplus, nor reduction, nor adjournment; consequently if these last cases exist, that turns to a sale, subjected to the tolerances and the prohibitions”. - Finally Malek has said, “Whoever advances a quantity of brown wheat, it is good that he receive it after the time has expired. It will be the same for the advance of any other species, where it is allowed that it has a better or lower quality, once the deadline is ended. This is interpreted as follows: “Whether the man advances a quantity of wheat, it is good that he takes back in exchange for barley or brown wheat. Whether the advance made is “ajwa” dates, it is still to be exchanged for so-called “saihania” dates (mediocre and dry dates) or a heap of different qualities. Whether it's from red grape, it is to be exchanged for dry black grapes, provided that all such exchanges are accomplished after the period has expired, and that the measure thereof is equal to equal”. Chapter XXI The sale of food exchanged for another without distinguishing them 
(1345) 53 - It was reported to Malek that Soulaiman Ibn Yassar related: "The supply of the donkey of Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas being exhausted, he said to his servant: "Take wheat from your parents, and exchange it for barley, and let it be in equal quantity. 
(1346) 54 - Nafe’a reported that Soulaimnan Ibn Yassar told him that, the supply of the donkey of Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Aswad Ibn Abd Al-Yahouth, was exhausted, the latter said to his servant: "Take wheat from your parents, in as food, in exchange for which you will buy barley, and take only an equal quantity". 
(1347) 55 - It was reported to Malek that Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad and Ibn Mu'aiqil Al-Dawsi acted similarly”. - Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina), it is that we do not sell wheat for wheat, nor dates for dates, nor wheat for dates, nor dates for raisins, nor wheat against raisins, nor any of that food, unless the sale is made from hand to hand. Because, as long as there is a delay in the transactions, the sale is no longer legal, but rather illegal. And let this be followed for any other food, if it is not exchanged from hand to hand”. - Malek also said: "You cannot sell food of the same kind in such a way that two quantities are exchanged for one, for example: that a moudd of wheat is exchanged for two moudds, nor a moudd of dates against two, nor a mudd of raisin against two, nor any other grasses or foods which are of one kind, even if it is made by hand. For this is considered to be analogous to the sale of silver for silver, and gold for gold, where what is lawful will be absent if there is a surplus, but present if the sale is made in equal proportion and hand to hand". - Malek continued: “If the food, intended to be eaten or drunk, presents a difference in measure or weight, and that therefore this difference is very clear, it is agreeable that the exchange of one measure be made for two, but from hand to hand. hand. Thus, it is correct to exchange one sa' of dates for two sa's of wheat, one sa' of dates for two sa's of raisins, one sa' of wheat for two sa's of fat. Thus, if the two species are different, it is agreeing to sell two measures in exchange for one, or even more, from hand to hand. But, if there is an expected delay (between delivery and payment), everything will be illicit". Malek finally said: - It is not legal that an indeterminate quantity of wheat is exchanged for another of the same kind, but on the contrary, if the exchange is made from hand to hand for a quantity of wheat against another of dates, and it is even tolerated that the we randomly sell wheat for dates”. * Subsequently, all difference highlighted for two kinds of food, will allow them to be bought, as a whole, in a random way and from hand to hand. But if the deadline is at its end, it is better not to do so, because buying randomly is the same as buying again random money by gold. However, whether wheat is randomly purchased for silver, or dates for gold, this is lawful and good”. * On the other hand, the one who piles up food, knowing its weight well, sells it to a buyer, without his admitting it to him, this is not permitted. Now, the case being, the buyer can deliver the food to the seller, lest he has been deceived, ignoring the weight. This is still the case, for all what the seller knows about it and the weight and measure of food and other merchandise, and yet the random sale, without the buyer knowing it. Thus, if the buyer is willing, he can return to the seller what he bought. Well-versed men constantly prohibit such a way of selling”. * It is not good, to sell bread one loaf for two, nor one large for one small, if some are larger than others. However, it is sought that the loaves be of the same size, so that the exchange is made on an equal basis, this is permitted, even without weighing them”. * It is not admitted that we sell a moudd of butter and a moudd of milk against two moudds of butter. This is similar to what was quoted about the dates sold, two sa's of 'kabiss' dates and one sa' of 'hachaf' dates in exchange for three sa's of 'ajwa' dates, when a man said to another: “I will give you two sa's of "Kabiss" dates against three others of "ajwa", searching there to sell his goods. The same goes for the owner of the butter and milk moulds, who wants to benefit from the other person, from a mould of butter, which is superior to mould of milk'. * It is permitted to sell wheat exchanged for flour, on an equal basis, because the flour has already been cleared of sound. Even in the case where half a moudd of flour, mixed with half a moudd of wheat, to be exchanged for a moudd of wheat, this is the same as the cases mentioned above (i.e. milk and butter, loaves of bread), therefore it is not permitted because this exchange of half a flour grind aims to have on the other hand a half wheat grind which is superior to it”. Chapter XXIII Selling all the food 
(1348) 56 • Malek a reported that Muhammad Ibn Abdallah Ibn Abi Mariam said to Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab: "I buy myself food by titles of 'Al-Jar', or it happens that I buy myself against a dinar and a half dirham (by these titles) where they give me half of the food”. Sa'id him answered: "No, it is better that you give yourself a dirham, and for the rest, take food". 
(1349) 57 - It was reported to Malek that Muhammad Ibn Sirin said: "Do not sell the grains while they are in their ears before they have become thick". - Malek said: A - When a man buy food for a specific price, and at a specific time, then that time ends, and the seller says to the buyer: "I do not have the food that I promised you, so sell- me for a fixed time", the buyer replies: "This is not tolerated because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has prohibited the sale of the food before it is possessed". The seller's reply: "So sell me this food for a fixed time so that I can fulfill it", this is still forbidden because it is as if gave him food to take back, and the gold he had given, shall be the price of what he owed, and the food which he had given him shall become lawful. Such a transaction, if carried out, will consist of selling food before having possessed it”. B - Concerning the man who owes a food from another, and that the latter owes it likewise from a third; that the second says to the first: "you will have to negotiate, about your food, with another, who owes me the same food which is moreover of the same value as that which you owe me". Malek said: “act thus, is forbidden, as it is a way of selling the food before it is possessed. However if the food is already possessed , it will be allowed that there is negotiation between the first and the third, because this case does not present any more an action to sell, for the good reason, that it is well known, the prohibition to sell a food before she is not possessed. This is, therefore, in accordance with the refusal of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) concerning the above subject, while religiously versed men have held association, delegation, and avoidance of contract admissible when it comes to food. They also equated this case to a deed of good without them taking it for a sale. They have, at this title, gave the example of a man who lends to another dirhams whose weight is lower than the legal standard to have them later dirhams whose weight is legal; this is tolerated even if there is a difference in weight. But that he buys dirhams of an inferior quality to have after others which are legal, this is not tolerated. It is also forbidden for him to lend dirhams lower than what is legal and intends to take them back after the determined time, other dirhams of legal weight”. 
(1350) 58 - What is similar to the cases, cited above, is what the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbade about the sale called "Al-Muzabana", and allowed for Al'araya, namely to sell the fresh dates against the dry dates by distinguishing between them: Al-muzabana implies a damage, on the other hand the sale of al-araya is said to be an act of good”. - Malek said: A - II is not tolerated let a man buy food at the price of a quarter or a third or even a fraction of a dirham, provided he has this food after a while. But it is benevolent that he buys himself food by a fraction of a dirham so that he has this food after a determined time, then that he gives a dirham so that he has a commodity among many. others, for what remains to him of the value of his dirham, because he had given the fraction he owes, in money". B - It is tolerated that a man keeps in reserve at another, a dirham, then he buys a specific commodity for the value, or a quarter or a third or a fraction of this dirham”. But, if in this case, the price is not fixed and the man will say, "I buy myself goods according to the everyday price", this is not allowed, because it is random, where the seller can either increase or decrease the price at its own way. All the more so since they did not separate by agreeing both on the quantity of the goods and on its price”. C - When a man sells merchandise randomly, without discarding any part of it and then going to buy a part of it, this is not tolerated except if that part purchased is subject to a fixed exception of less than one-third. In case this part exceeds one third, it will be the mouzabana that is repelled. Thus, what is tolerated is at the limit of a third, and this is what is an undisputed norm with us (in Medina)”. Chapter XXIV Of grabbing and waiting 
(1351) 59 - It was reported in Malek that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “Grabbing is prohibited in our markets. Men having within their reach the goods that Allah has granted us, and that they are in our markets, will not have to monopolize them. On the other hand, any man having brought a commodity, carrying it, winter and summer, on his back, this one is the guest of Omar: that he sell it as he wishes or even retain it". 
(1352) 60 - Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab passed by Hateb Ibn Abi Balta'a, while he was selling his raisin in the market”. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab told him, "Either you sell according to the current market price, or you leave our market." 
(1353) 61 - It was reported to Malek that Osman Ibn Affan, forbade hoarding”. Chapter XXV Of the Permissible Sale of Animals of the Same Species, and of the Advance Paid on Them. 
(1354) 62 - Hassan Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ali Ibn Abi Taleb reported that Ali Ibn Abi Taleb sold a camel he owned, called 'Us-saifir', for twenty camelets, at a specified time. 
(1355) 63 - Nafe’a reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar bought himself a camel against four camelets guaranteed to him, while having to pay “Al Rabza”. 
(1356) 64 - Malek a reported that he asked Ibn Chehab about selling one animal for two, eventually? Ibn Chehab replied, "That is tolerated." - Malek said: * What is tracked at us (in Medina), it is that we tolerate the sale of a camel for the same camel, by paying dirhams more, from hand to hand. It is also tolerated the sale of a camel against another camel, and that the dirhams paid in addition, are paid in time. On the contrary, it is not it is not good that one camel is sold for another, in the long term, and that the dirhams paid in addition are paid as a cash sum. It is not good either, that the camel and the dirhams are delivered in time”. * It is good that we buys himself a camel of good breed, exchanged for two or more others of an ordinary breed from a herd of camels even if they are of the same species. It is even tolerated that one buys a camel against two in the future, provided that they do not show themselves clearly different, or on the contrary completely similar, with the variation or not of their kind, because in this case, it is not appropriate to sell forward, one, against two". * The interpretation of this refusal, is explained by the fact, that this exchange during the sale, of a camel against two, showed that there is neither superiority of race, nor power of load. Thus, if these two distinctions were not found, it is not necessary that one buys oneself in the long term, two for one. But it is tolerated that we sell what we bought, before it was possessed, to someone other than the one from whom we bought, if the price was paid to the latter”. * The one who pays in advance, for an animal, eventually, and that he has made the description of this animal, this is tolerated. Consequently, this becomes an obligation for both the seller and the buyer for having made the description of this animal. Besides, such a way of haggling, is always followed by people, and even accepted, by men versed among us (in Medina)”. Chapter XXI Animals that are prohibited from sale 
(1357) 65 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has forbidden the sale of what a female wears, and that she will give birth. It was a sale followed at the pre-Islamic era, when a man bought a carrying camel so that she gave birth and that the latter in turn would give birth to another camel”. 
(1358) 66 - Ibn Chehab a reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: “Never practice usury in the animal trade. And we had forbidden this under three conditions: the sale of what the females carry, the mating stallions, and the female for what she carries and what she will give birth to". - Malek said: “He does not someone must not buy an animal which is described, and which is not present, even if he had previously seen and accepted it, by paying its price, and that its possession is made of it sooner or later”. This is refused, for the good reason that the seller has already taken advantage of the price, without knowing whether or not the goods in question are still in the initial state, as fixed by the buyer. This explains the refusal; on the other hand, this refusal is an admission, if the price is paid on condition that the animal to be sold, is such as it was described”. Chapter XXVII Selling animals for meat 
(1359) 67 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab said that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has forbidden the sale of animals for meat”. 
(1360) 68 - Daoud Ibn Al-Hussain reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab say: “Among the games of chance, practiced in the pre-Islamic period, there was the sale of the animal against meat, and the sheep against two”. 
(1361) 69 - Abu Al-Zanad reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said; “We had forbidden the sale of the animal (live) against meat”. - Abu Al-Zanad also said: "Then I addressed myself to Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab, saying: that you say, about a man who bought an old camel for ten sheep”? Sa'id to reply: "If he bought it to sacrifice it, he is not good". And, added Abou Al-Zanad: "People I have known, have prohibited the sale of the animal against meat", and Abou-Zanad concludes: "And this had been prescribed to the prefects, of the time of Aban Ibn Osman and Hisham Ibn Ismaïl, to prohibit the sale of an animal against meat". Chapter XXVIII Meat sold for meat 
(1362) 70 - Malek said: “What is the unquestionably followed norm among us (in Medina), concerning the meat of camels, cows, sheep, and all animals like them, is to barter only on an equal basis, or equivalent weights, taking delivery immediately. He It is also tolerated that we barter meat, without having weighed it, provided that we have fixed the exchange of hand to hand. - Malek added: “He is tolerated to barter the flesh of fish, against that of camels, cows, sheep, and other animals, in the equivalence of two measures against one and in an immediate way. But if this is done in time, there will be no good”. Malek finally said: “As for the flesh of poultry, I see it as different, meat from herds and fish. Thus, it is tolerated that we buy it in order of preference. However, this flesh should never be sold in the long term”. Chapter XXIX Of what is the price of the dog 
(1363) 71 - Abu Mass'ud Al-Ansari reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade profit from the prize of the dog, of the reward of the prostitute, and of the wages of the soothsayer". And he means by the recompense in question, the price paid for fornication, and for the fortune of the seer, the bribe he receives so that he predicts. - Malek said: "I disapprove of the price of the dog, whether hunting, or otherwise, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was against ". Chapter XXX Advances and sale of goods commingled with each other 
(1364) 72 - It was reported to Malek that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) has forbidden any sale conditional on an advance”. Malek, performer this, says: “That a man says to another: I will buy at such price, your goods, provided that you advance me such sum, the contract of sale concluded according to the example above, is unacceptable. But if he who had laid down the condition of an advance, abandons it, this contract would be accepted”. Malek added: “There is no harm if the man buys himself a garment of "linen" (or "du Chatur" or "du Qassabi" in exchange for one or two or even three garments of the genre or "Itribi" or "Qassi" or “Ziqa” or “Harawi” or "Marwi" or even Yemeni clothes or izar, but whether it's skillfully done or eventually. If these garments are of the same fabric, the forward sale is wear and tear. Also, it is inappropriate to sell one piece of clothing for two, in the long run, unless they are clearly different, because if they are more or less the same and they are by the name of the different fabrics, this is always unsuitable, for example, that two garments from the “Harawi” are sold for one garment from the “Qouhi” or from the “Fourkoubi” for one garment from the “chatwi”. And if it is made that these genres are of the same quality, it is forbidden that we buy two clothes against one, in the long term". - Malek has finally says: "It is tolerated that one sells what one bought oneself by paying the price and before making possession of it, of the third person". Chapter XXXI The advance made for the purchase of goods 
(1365) 73 - Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that he heard Abdallah Ibn Abbas say - when a man asked him about another man, who paid in advance, the price of articles made of linen, expecting to sell them before not to have possessed them”? That this sale of money for money, is, answered Ibn Abbas, prohibited”. - Malek on this, answered: "There, I think, and Allah is most informed, that this man was seeking to sell the articles of the merchant from whom he had them. purchased from the same merchant at a much higher price than their purchase price. Now, if he was going to sell them to another person, that is permit”. - Malek said: "the norm unquestionably followed in Medina, is the following: "concerning, the one who pays in advance and on time, the slaves, the herds or other merchandise, so that the whole is qualified, if the date is due, the one who bought what is quoted above, cannot sell anything to the one from whom he bought, and especially of a higher price in comparison with what he had paid in advance for sum, before having the possession of this sum in question. And if he acts contrary, it will be usury, as long as the buyer having given the seller dinars or dirhams in advance, from which the latter had benefited, on the appropriate date, the buyer reselling the same goods to the seller before having ownership of the latter, the buyer would in this case have collected the sum paid in advance and an additional sum, and this is usury”. ' - Malek added: “The one who pays in advance and in the future, gold or silver to buy a herd or another qualified commodity and that the date is due, it is tolerated that the buyer sells part of his goods to the seller, against others (not of the same nature as the goods already purchased), but that it be done immediately, whatever the price. However, this is no longer tolerated, if it is about food, because it is not lawful for him to sell it, once he has owned it. Consequently, the buyer will be able to sell this commodity to someone who is not necessarily the seller from whom he bought this food, against gold or silver or any other commodity, of which he must immediately take possession without any delay. Because if he takes delayed possession will not be good, and it constitutes a sale of debt for term debt to a third person (i.e., who is no longer the buyer or the seller)". - Malek finally said: A - The one who pays advance, the price of a commodity which is neither food nor drink, and that this is done in time, this buyer, can sell it to whom he wishes for money or d other commodity, even before he possessed it from the seller; but, he must not sell what he has bought, to the seller, unless it is exchanged for a commodity to be possessed without any delay”. Before the date of delivery, the buyer is allowed to barter it to the seller, against a commodity of a different kind, and that this difference is quite clear, and also, that he immediately takes possession of this new commodity". B - The one who pays in advance, and eventually, dinars or money, to buy four pieces of quality fabric, on the due date, these pieces cannot be found at the seller's, and the buyer finds other pieces of fabric there of lesser quality, then if the salesman says to him: "I sell you, in exchange against the four pieces, eight others of another fabric", this is tolerated. Thus, if the buyer immediately takes these eight coins before he separates from the merchant, this is tolerated. However, it is not appropriate to make this transaction either before or even on the due date, unless the parts exchanged are different from those for which the price has been paid in advance”. Chapter XXXU The sale of copper, iron, and similar metals by weight (1366)74-Malek said: - The rule followed at us (in Medina), concerning that which is sold by weight, with the exception of gold and silver, namely red or yellow copper, lead, and tin, iron, vegetables, figs, cotton, or other products similar to them and sold by weight, it is good, to skilfully sell of the same species, two weights against one, for example two weights of iron, against a weight of the same metal”. - However, it is not not good, that one sells, in the long term, two weights against a weight, of the same species, of any product quoted above. But if they are different, and that this difference is clear, it is tolerated that the sale is made for two masses against one mass, and in the long term. On the other hand, if they are close, by their category, and even if they are of different names such as lead and tin, red copper and yellow copper, I disapprove, says Malek, that we sell two weights against one in the long term”. - On the other hand, when we buys all the products, previously mentioned, it is tolerated even before owning them to sell them to a third party, as long as you collect the price, and provided that you have bought them by weight or measure ". “But if the purchase was made without taking no measurement of the goods, whether these products are sold to a third party in cash or on credit, because the guarantee is imposed there. However, this guarantee will no longer be compulsory if the sale is made after having either weighed or measured the products and after they have been received'. "And that's the best I've heard about it, and people keep following it back home (in Medina)." - What is tracked for that which is measured or weighed, and which is neither to be eaten nor to be drunk, such as safflower, pits, tree leaves, myrtle and other species similar to them, is that it is tolerated that two quantities of the same species are sold for one, provided that this is not done in time. But if the two species differ and that their difference is clearly perceived, it is tolerated to sell two quantities against one, but in the long term. And all that one will have bought of these products, it is tolerated that one sells them to a third person, on the condition of having taken possession of it and to have touched the price of it. - And all that people sell to profit from it as products even if it is about small pebbles or plaster, if one sells them, two quantities against one, in the long term, it is usury; or even that it is a quantity against a similar and something else in addition, done in the long term, it is also wear and tear”. Chapter XXXIII The ban on making two kinds of sales in one 
(1367) 75 - It was reported to Malek that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade making two kinds of sales in one”. 
(1368) 76 - It was reported to Malek that a man had said to another: “Buy for me this camel in cash, so that I may buy it from you in the future". Abdallah Ibn Omar, questioned on this subject, refused such a sale and prohibited it”. 
(1369) 77 - It was reported in Malek that Al-Kassem Ibn Mouhammad had been questioned about a man who had bought goods at ten dinars in cash or at fifteen dinars in advance". al-Kassem, had rejected such a purchase, and forbade it”. - About a man who had bought from another, a commodity, either at ten dinars cash, or at fifteen forward, and that the buyer will have to opt for one of these two prices, Malek said: "This is not tolerated, because if he fact that the ten dinars will be paid later, they must be paid at the value of fifteen; and if he pays the ten dinars in cash, it is as if he had bought what is worth fifteen dinars forward”. - Malek was questioned, about a man who bought from another, a commodity, either at ten dinars in cash, or for a specific good quality sheep, at term, and that the buyer, therefore, must opt for one of the two prizes", he replied: "This is not tolerated, and is refused, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him be grace and peace of Allah) forbade the two sales made in one". And the sale in question is an example of this. - For the man who said to another: "I will buy from you, for one dinar, fifteen sa's of dates "ajwa" or ten sa's of dates "Saihania", or fifteen sa's of wheat deliverable, or ten sa's of brown wheat, and I owe one of these goods," Malek said, "Such a sale is forbidden, for, by the price he fixes, the buyer gives himself the choice of taking what he wants, preferring for example the fifteen sa's of "ajwa" to the other ten of "Saihania", or fifteen sa's of ordinary wheat to another ten of brown wheat. This is similar to what is prohibited for two sales made in one, and again what is inadmissible regarding the sale of the same kind of food, two quantities against one, and to have at the same price”. Chapter XXXIV The random sale 
(1370) 78 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade the random sale”. - Malek said: - What is random and yet another form of bet is that a man, having lost his mount or his maroon slave, the price of which is fifty dinars, that a another says to him: "I will buy it from you at the price of twenty dinars", at the case, where the buyer finds it, the seller will have lost thirty dinars; Where in case he does not find it, the seller will have received the sum of twenty dinars from the buyer”. “On the other hand, it is vicious for another reason, in the event that what was lost is found, but while being changed a little or too much, or even having suffered some defect, this constitutes a great risk”. - However, what is followed with us (in Medina), and which is considered as random, the purchase of what women and females wear; for one cannot know whether what is worn will be brought into the world, and one cannot know whether it will be beautiful or ugly, of a complete or incomplete creation, male or female; and in all this there are preferences, from such to such, and its value will be such and such according to the state”. - Still it is not tolerated to sell the females by setting aside, what they carry; that a man for example says to another: "the price of my dairy sheep is three dinars, but I will give it to you at two, at provided that I have what she wears; but this is refused, because it is a random and risky sale”. - It is unlawful that olives are sold for olive oil, nor sesame for oil, nor fat for butter, because the mouzabana comes into play here. game in this case. Although a man buys grain or the like for himself, against what he can extract from these grains, not even knowing, if what is extracted is less or more, this is also random and risky”. - It is the same for whoever buys willow seeds for their crude oil, this is random, because what is extracted from willow seeds is none other than its raw material. However, it is tolerated that willow seeds be exchanged for scented seeds, as the latter have been subjected to a transformation where they have been perfumed, dried, so that they are no longer in the state of a raw material”. - About a man instructing another to sell him a commodity by fixing him a minimum price, Malek said: "Such a sale is illicit and is even random". And this is interpreted as follows: “it is as if he hired him, for a profit, in case this commodity will be sold at a price exceeding that which had been fixed. But if it is sold either at the same price, or less, and the effort of the buyer is in vain, this is not permitted. Because he is entitled to a salary evaluating the effort he had made for the sale. As for the seller, he will, on his part, be entitled to profit or loss, if the merchandise has been sold at a higher or lower price. On the other hand, he must assume the loss if this merchandise remains unsold, to be sold later at a lower price. But if the goods are still in demand, the sales contract will be cancelled”. - Malek has finally said: "But if a man definitely sells to another, a commodity, as a result of which the buyer will regret this transaction, saying to the seller: give me a discount" and that the latter answers him: “Sell it instead, and you won't lose", this sale is tolerated, because it has nothing random, because the difference in price will be borne by the seller even if it is not a term of the contract, and this is what, moreover, we follow in Medina". Chapter XXXV The moulamassa” and “the mounabaza” 
(1371) 79 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade "mulamassah and mounabaza". - Malek said: “the moulamassa is to allow the man to touch the fabric, without spreading it, thus ignoring, if there is a defect, or that he buys it at night, without having examined it properly". “And the mounabaza, is that a man spreads his cloth and another spreads his without one examining the cloth of the other, then that one says to the other: such cloth against Phone; but this is what is forbidden from the moulamassa and the mounabaza”. - About the sale of Persian fabric in their wrapper or the so-called "Qoubti" fabric all folded, Malek said: "It is only tolerated to sell them after having spread them out, examining them, otherwise their sale is random and precisely she is almoulamassa”. - On the other hand, the sale of the pieces of fabric according to the catalog is quite different from that of Persian and Qubti fabrics. This practiced sale that people have been following for a long time, imitating in this way, those who preceded them, is always allowed, because it is not designed to be random like the moulamassa, even if there has not been to spread the fabrics”. Chapter XXXVI Selling for a profit 
(1372) 80 - Malek reported: "What is followed with us (in Medina), about a haberdasher who buys clothes from one country, to sell them in another, aiming to make a profit", is that it will have to exclude from the price: the sum to be paid for the brokers, the costs of bending and pulling, and the rental of the house. As for the cost of transporting these garments, they will be part of the initial price, without considers a profit, unless the seller makes it known to the buyers; this being the case, if they can make him benefit from a certain sum, willingly, this will be tolerated”. - Malek said: “For this which is laundering, sewing and dyeing, they are to be considered, just like the case of clothing. The profit one earns on them is to be calculated just as it is done for clothes. In the event that the haberdasher sells the clothes without informing the buyer of the costs mentioned above, he is not owed any additional profit. Thus, if the clothes are not sold, the transport costs will be part of the price, without counting any additional profit, if the opposite occurs, any sale is to be eliminated, between seller and buyer, except if the latter s 'agree with each other on other items that may be purchased'. - About the man who buys goods for gold or silver, and that on the day of the purchase, the dinar was equivalent to ten dirhams, then that this man is in another country in order to sell them for a profit, or that he sells them in the same country, for the one from whom he buys them. is purchased, according to the exchange that took place on the very day of this sale", Malek said: "If he had bought them and paid for them with dirhams, and sold them for dinars, or vice versa, and that the goods were still at the sale the buyer will have to choose: either to buy these goods or to leave them. But if the goods are not sold, the buyer has the right to buy them according to the paid purchase price which will be the right of both. - If a man sells a goods that he had bought for a hundred dinars, in such a way, to receive eleven dinars against the ten, as selling price, then he realizes that the purchase price was not more than ninety dinars and that his merchandise is no longer sold, the seller will have the choice of receiving the value of his merchandise according to the price at which he sold it, unless this sum is greater than that which he had as right on the day of the sale; in this case, he does not receive more than the price, namely, against a hundred dinars, he will have ten more, or else a profit will be calculated for him taking into account the real price which was four and twenty and ten except if the value of the goods is lower than the actual value; in this case, he can receive a sum worth the real price of the goods, namely 90 dinars and a gain of ten for ceni which is nine, and thus, he will have an overall sum of four and twenty and ten and nine dinars”. - Malek finally said: "if a man sells a commodity for a gain, saying that he bought it for a hundred dinars, then someone comes and tells him after a while, that the buyer who had already bought this commodity, in made at one hundred and twenty dinars, the buyer will have to choose: either that he gives the seller the sum which is the price of the goods, on the day of the sale, namely one hundred dinars, or that he gives an amount equivalent to the price sale taking into account the gain he has obtained whatever it is, and which does not must not, in any case, be less in value than the purchase price, because it has no right to cause the seller any loss, since the sale was concluded pursuant to a transaction made between the two parties . Because, in such a case, the seller may claim the difference in price and the buyer on his part cannot refuse it and make a discount of the purchase price according to the catalog”. Chapter XXXVII Selling according to a catalog 
(1373) 81 - Concerning the men who have bought a commodity such as clothes or slaves, and that a man was aware of this purchase, that he comes to say, to one of them: "The clothes you bought at such and such a merchant, I already know their quality and their nature. Do you want, therefore, that I make you benefit from a certain sum concerning your share, for what is purchased? The other having accepted it, then the new buyer will make him benefit from a sum, and consequently, becomes, a partner in his place among men, in case, where the buyer examines the goods, and finds them ugly and unsuitable; Malek said on this subject, "He must obligatorily discharge it, and will not be able to refuse any more, as long as he bought the goods according to a well described and known catalog". - Malek also added: “A haberdasher, having received a quantity of fabrics, and that the merchants are present at his home, he reads his catalog to them, saying: “With such a measurement one can make a Basrarian coat, with such another a "Sabria", and so on, so, buy these fabrics, according to this which I have just informed you". Then the merchants buy these fabrics as they have been described, realize later, on examining them, that they have been paid for at a high price, and regret that this purchase has been concluded". On this subject, Malek said: “This sale is assigned to them, as long as it has been shown to be suitable for the catalog”. Moreover, it is the rule followed by people here (in Medina), that they never stop judging lawful between them, if what is bought is in conformity with the catalog, without it being different from it” . Chapter XXXVIII The optional sale 
(1374) 82 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “A seller and a buyer, who have agreed among themselves on an optional sale, have the right to withdraw from the sale as long as they have not separated, unless the sale is not made at option". Malek said: “The question of the option has, for us (in Medina), no limit, nor a precise thing”. 
(1375) 83 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Mass'ud taught that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had said: "A seller and a buyer, who between them, have concluded a sale and quarrel, one takes into account what the seller stipulates, otherwise, the contract of sale is to be cancelled”. Malek said, “A man, buys goods, and the seller stipulates, before the sale is concluded, that he must consult a third person in such a way that: "If the latter agrees, the sale is permitted, otherwise there will be no more sales". The contract is concluded between them, then immediately after the buyer regrets it even before the seller has consulted, the third party", Malek says: "This sale is an obligation, according to what was agreed between them, by Consequently, the buyer does not have to choose, if the third person consulted agrees. - Malek finally said: “Let a man buy himself a commodity from another, then let them both dispute the price, and the seller says: "I sold it to you for ten dinars" and the buyer replies: "No, I bought it for five", we will say, in this case to the seller: "If you want, you can sell it to him, at the price he has fixed, or else, swear to sell it to him only at the price you have just told him". Now, if the seller swears, the buyer will be told: "Either you buy the goods at the price the seller has fixed, or you swear to buy them only at the price you have even fixed. If the buyer takes an oath, it is considered, in this case, that each of these two, the buyer and the seller, accuses each other”. Chapter XXXIX usurious debts 
(1376) 84 - Abu Saieh, the servant of “Al-Saffah” (the first of the Abbasite caliphs) reported: “I had sold for a certain period of time a garment which belonged to me to people from “Nakhla” (place in Medina). Then wanting to leave at Al-Koufa, they offered to pay me the cash price by making a discount? I was going to ask about this Zaid Ibn Thabet who said to me: "I order you not to do this, nor to let others the right to do so”. 
(1377) 85 - Salem Ibn Abdallah reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar was asked about a man who eventually owes a debt to another, and asks the creditor to postpone to pay it before the due date”? He disapproved of this and even prohibited it. 
(1378) 86 - Malek a reported that Zaid Ibn Aslam said: "Usury, in pre-Islamic times, consisted in the fact that a man owed a debt to another, and if so, he said: 'Do you want to pay it to me, or you will pay it later with interest”? Thus, if he pays the other will have what is in his right; otherwise, he will grant him a delay, after the debt increases, of a certain interest”. - Malek said: “what unquestionably repugnant to us, (in Medina), is that a man having a debt to pay to another the first makes a remission to the second in order to recover his money before its term, which consequently is to be compared, in the case where a creditor will grant a delay to his debtor by increasing the debt by a surplus (taken as interest); but that is, no doubt, wear and tear». - Malek also said: “Concerning a man, who owes another a debt of one hundred dinars, and eventually; on the due date, that the debtor says to the creditor: "Sell me, a commodity at the cash price of one hundred dinars, and one hundred and fifty dinars in the future"; Malek replied, "It's a sale that is not admitted, and such is always what is repugnant, by well-versed men". - Malek finally said, interpreting the cause of this repugnance: "It is that the creditor would have, in this case, sold to the debtor, the goods at its real price, by delaying the payment of one hundred dinars, in the long term, to which, he will add fifty dinars because of delay. But this is repugnant, and inadmissible. Moreover, this is to be compared, to what Zaid Ibn Aslam reported, concerning the sale in the pre-Islamic era, where once the debts were due on the date, they said: "Where you pay, or your debt is increased; If he paid, the creditor took his due; otherwise, the debt was increased, by a certain amount of interest, to be paid on time”. Chapter XLL Debt and transfer of debt (to a third party) 
(1379) 87 - Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam)r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) said: “Let a rich man, delays, what he has to pay, is an injustice. If one of you receives a delegation, of debt on a solvent man, that he accepts this delegation. 
(1380) 88 - Malek a reported that Moussa Ibn Maissara heard a man ask Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab: "I am a man who sells on credit". So Sa'id answered him, "Sell only with what you need to get home." - Malek said: "Concerning a man who buys a commodity from another, on condition that he deliver it to him on a definite date, and that be for a fair where he wishes to sell it, or for a necessity at the designated time and then the seller does not deliver it to him on the scheduled date, which will lead the buyer to return the goods". In this regard, Malek said: "The buyer will not have the right to do so, and he must pay the price of the goods purchased, because if the seller had delivered them to him before that date, the buyer would have accepted them”. - Malek also said: "For he who buys food, and measures it or weighs it, and then someone comes to his house, wanting to buy it for him, and the owner of the food informs him that he had bought it for himself- even, and having even weighed it, the buyer believes it and wants it take according to the measurement already made, paying the cash price”. Malek in this regard says: “What is sold according to such criteria, is permitted; but if it is sold, according to this term criterion, it is repugnant, unless the buyer does not weigh or measure the goods himself. either not of the same measure or of the same weight. And if this sale is made in time, it is repugnant, And there is no disagreement on this subject with us (in Medina)”. -Malek added: “He does not should not buy a debt from a man, whether or not he is present, if there is not a declaration made on the part of the debtor, nor from a dead person even if one knows what this dead man left, because the fact of buying in this way is uncertain, especially since we do not know whether or not it is possible to complete this transaction”. As for the interpretation of this reluctance, it is explained as follows: "If one buys a debt from an absentee or from a dead person, one does not know what unknown creditor is attached to this debt, this . Thus, if the deceased owed a debt, the sum which had been paid will remain vain and useless”. - Malek finally said: “Let us underline, too, the presence of another vice: It's that he bought this which is not guaranteed for him. And if what is bought is not delivered to the buyer, the price he should have paid would be vain and invalid. And it's still random, and it's not allowed. - However, added Malek, there is a difference between the fact that the man only sells what he owns, and on the other hand, that the man advances for something that he does not in fact own. Whoever wants to buy a commodity takes his money, what he intends to buy and says: “What do you want me to buy you with these ten dinars? Now, acting as such, it is as if he sells them cash for fifteen forwards. It is for this reason that the sale is considered prohibited and is usury, even an imposture”. Chapter XLI Association, delegation (of debts) and termination 
(1381) 89 - Concerning the man who sells several kinds of clothes, making an exception of some that are embroidered, Malek said: “If he wants, keep away a few of these clothes, there is no harm in that; but if he does not make a choice, with the exception of a few clothes, I believe that he becomes a partner in the clothes that we bought from him, because it is possible that the two clothes are embroidered in the same way, and yet their prices are different”. - Malek said: “what is followed at (in Medina), it is that there is no harm in association, delegation and termination being particulated in respect of food and other goods, be- whether they are deliverable or not, and whether the sale is made in cash, without there being neither profit, nor lack, nor delay in payment. However, if one of these three aspects is present, the sale will be lawful like any other sale, and prohibited for any prohibition found in the sale. Therefore, there will be no association, delegation or termination”. - Malek also said: “Whoever buys for merchandise, either clothes or slaves, and that there is a man proposing to the buyer, that he is associated in this sale thus paying, both, the price of the merchandise. Subsequently, if the goods, for any reason, are no longer deliverable, in such a way that the partner asks for his money from the other, and the first in turn claims the full price of the goods of the seller, except that the first buyer asks his associate just at the sale and session done, telling him: "The deposit that is yours, belongs to the seller". But after separation and the first buyer has neglected this condition, he will bear all responsibility”. - Malek finally said, "Let one man say to another: buy this merchandise for both of us, equally, paying my share as regards the price, as for me, I will take care of selling it to you", that is not allowed, for the following good reason: "When the man says, let the price be paid by the other, as for him, he will take care of the sale, it is as if the half of the price will be considered as an advance made to the second person, due to being responsible for the sale. On the other hand, if this merchandise is no longer valid, or it is no longer salable, the buyer may have from his partner, half the price that he had paid, and this value will be like an advance which will imply a profit (which is usury). But if a man buys a commodity, which is already his property, and another says to him: "Make me associated with this merchandise by paying me the price I owe, as for me, I will resell it to you" , this is licit, and is even tolerated. The interpretation of this means that it is a new sale which is accomplished by selling him half of the merchandise, and the other will later be the seller”. Chapter XLII Debtor's bankruptcy 
(1382) 90 - Abu Bakr Ibn Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Hareth Ibn Hisham reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "When a man sells a commodity to another, and the one who has just bought it goes bankrupt, while the seller has not received anything from the price of the merchandise which is intact, the seller has more rights than the buyer, and can take back his merchandise. However, in the event that the buyer dies, the seller will be held to be a creditor”. 
(1383) 91 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "The man who finds as is his goods which he had sold to another who has gone bankrupt, the former has more right than anyone else to take back his goods”. - Malek said: A - When a man sells goods, and the buyer goes bankrupt, if the seller finds his goods as they are, he can take them back. Yes the buyer had already partially sold this merchandise, or even that he had distributed it, the seller will have the full right to take back the rest, without that, what has been partially sold of this merchandise, does not prevent him from taking it back. Even, if he wishes, he can return to the buyers what he received from the price. And as for the part that cannot be found, the seller will be a creditor in relation to the buyer who has made a deficit”. B - The one who buys himself any commodity, either weaving yarn, or a piece of land or something else, then that what is bought has been or worked - such as building a house on the land - or making thread a fabric, then the buyer made a deficit, bearing the owner of the piece of land to say to the buyer: "I am buying this piece of land, including what is built", this is not tolerated. Then we will evaluate the land, and what is built on it by the buyer, and we will fix both the price of the land and that of what is built on it, following which, the buyers will both be partners, emphasizing that the owner of the land will have what is his share, as for the creditors, they will have a share, what is built”. Interpreting this, Malek said, “Assuming that the assessed price is one thousand five hundred dirhams, then the value of the land will be five hundred, and that of what is built, one thousand dirhams. Therefore, the owner of the land will have one-third, and the other creditors, two-thirds. It will be the same with regard to weaving thread and the like, if they are worked and the buyer is indebted for them by a sum of which he cannot manage to get rid of them. acquit”. C - But as far as sold goods that the buyer had not worked on, except that their price has become higher, and that their owner is willing to keep them, as well as the creditors are willing on their part to retain them, these creditors will have to choose : or they pay at owner the price of the goods which he had sold, without reducing it, or that they return his goods to him. In the event that the price of the goods is reduced, the person who had optionally sold them may, if he wishes, take back his goods, without owing the creditors a share of his goods; or he is to be considered as one of the creditors, so he will be entitled to a share of the property, without have the goods”. D - The one who buys himself a slave or a mount who engenders at his place, then that he made a deficit, the slave or the mount with his child must return to the seller, except if the creditors do not want to pay him the price of the slave or the mount with her little one, so that they may retain them". Chapter XLIII Of what is advance allowed 
(1384) 92 - Abu Rafe, the freedman of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported: “The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) owed a young camel, to a man, who came to ask him for it; camels of alms, having reached the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (On him the grace and peace of Allah) he ordered me to give the man his camel. Telling him, that among the camels, there was not a camel of the same age, but another six years old, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to me: "Give it to him, because the best of you is the one who fulfills the payment of the debt he owes with the most of liberality”. 
(1385) 93 - Mujahed a reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar owed a man a certain amount of money, he gave him an amount exceeding that of the debt. Thereby the man said, “O Abu Abdul Rahman, what you have just given me for the debt is much more than what you owe me”; then Abdallah Ibn Omar answered him: "I know, but I had done it with all my soul". - Malek said: “He is tolerated to the one who advanced all that relates to either gold, or silver or food or an animal, to receive from the one who owes him, what is better compared to what he advanced, if ever there was between the two, no proposed condition, or custom. But if any condition or custom or anything is present, it is repugnant, and therefore does not bring any good." Interpreting this, Malek said, "The Messenger of Allah (Be upon him be grace and the peace of Allah) had acquitted himself against a young camel that he owed, another older camel and Abdallah Ibn Omar of a surplus debt. What is tolerated as long as there has been neither condition nor custom, therefore this is tolerated and licit”. Chapter XLV Prohibited Advances 
(1386) 94 - It was reported to Malek, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had made to another, a debt of food, on the condition that the second will return it to him in another country. And Omar said: "And the transport costs, who will take care of that?" 
(1387) 95 - It was reported to Malek that a man, on his way to see Abdallah Ibn Omar, said to him: "O Abu Abdul Rahman, I advanced a debt to a man, asking him to return it to me with a surplus" . So Abdallah Ibn Omar: “Such is the attrition”. The man resumed: “What are you ordering me to do”? Abdallah to answer: “The advance is of three aspects: one that you will advance desiring thereby, the Face of Allah, and you will have it; another of fact, where you will seek to please your companion, and you will receive his satisfaction; a third of accomplished, where you aim to get a lot more, and such is the wear”. The man again said, “What do you order me to do, O Abu Abdul Rahman”? He replied, "I conceive that you have to cancel the contract of the advance made; so if he gives it back for the same value you will have to accept it; if he gives it to you less than its value, and you accept it, you will have the reward; and if he gives you back wve advance of much more worth than the yours, he will thus show his gratitude, which is moreover a form of thanks, as for you, you will still have a reward». 
(1388) 96 • Nafe' reported that he heard Abdallah Ibn Umar say: “Whoever makes a loan should only ask to be reimbursed”. 
(1389) 97 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud said: “He who makes a loan, should not ask that the collection be much better, even if it is a handful of food, it will be wear and tear». - Malek said: “What is unquestionably followed among us (in Medina), about the one who borrows a well-defined animal for any enjoyment, that it is tolerated, on condition of returning an animal similar, except for the case of female slaves, where there would be the risk of doing what is not lawful, which in fact will be unlawful, but this is not allowed. The interpretation of this repugnance is explained as follows: "Supposing that a man borrows a slave, that he cohabits as he pleases, then that he returns her to her possessor, which is neither tolerated, or lawful. And well-versed men keep forbidding it without ever giving anyone permission to do so." Chapter XLV What is prohibited about haggling and overbidding 
(1390) 98 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Let none of you outbid another ". 
(1391) 99 - Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Do not go in front of caravans, that one of you does not sell to another, a commodity that he had already sold, do not indulge in one-upmanship, that a city dweller does not sell for a Bedouin, do not let the milk accumulate in the breasts of female camels and ewes, because the one who has bought one of them, will have the right when milking them either to keep it if he is satisfied with it, or to return it if he does not like it with a sa' of dates (in exchange for his milk ). By interpreting this hadith, Malek said: "What is meant by this, and Allah is most aware of it, that one should not overbid in sales, that it is intolerable for a man to outbid a commodity, when his co-religionist brother has already negotiated it, and that the seller on his part has agreed with the buyer on the weight of the gold, and has guaranteed against any defect that may exist in the goods , noting that the seller does not want to give his goods to the second buyer. This is what the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) has forbidden, and Allah is most aware of it. - Malek added: “He There is nothing wrong with haggling the price, where all final sales will be suspended, as long as everyone has the right to participate in the haggling. If people left the haggling and stopped at the price that the first buyer had already offered, the goods would have been sold at a low price and the sellers would be damaged. And this is what is always practiced in Medina”. 
(1392) 100 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had forbidden that we supplant others”. - Malek performing it says: "The action of overbidding is that a man gives a commodity a price exceeding what is effectively its value at the moment when one no longer intends to buy it but only to push another to buy it at this high price". Chapter XLVI On the sale in general 
(1393) 101 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that a man had taught the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) that he was deceived during the sale”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: "When you go to buy, tell the seller: "no deception". And this man, making the purchase, was saying to the seller: “no deception”. , 
(1394) 102 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab say: "If you arrive in a country and you find, that it is taken into account and the measure and the weight, make there, a long stay . On the other hand, if you find yourself in a country where weight and measure are neglected, hurry to leave this place”. 
(1395) 103 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Muhammad Ibn Al-Munkader say: “Allah loves the servant who shows magnanimity when selling, or buying, or paying or claiming his right”. Malek said A - Concerning the man who buys camels, or sheep, or clothes, or slaves, or any other commodity that can be counted, there is nothing random about this. B-About the man who gives another a commodity to sell it, when its owner had already made his assessment by saying to the other: "If you sell it for me at the price I have fixed, you will have a dinar" or something else what they agreed on and on which the two agree, and say if you don't sell it you won't get anything". This is tolerated, if the sale price of the goods, and what the seller will receive, is a fixed salary. So if he sells, he will benefit, if not, he will have nothing”. C-This is similar to a man who says to another, "If you can find me my runaway slave, or my stray camel, you will have such sum", this is considered as a fee paid, and not a salary, because the salary in this case does not is more suitable”. D As for the man to whom one gives a commodity, saying to it "Sell it, and you will have such an amount as a percentage of each dinar", this is not allowed because each dinar, reduced by the price of the goods, will imply a reduction in the duty of the other, and this is random". 104 Malek reported that he had asked Ibn Chehab about a man who rented a mount, then he in turn rented it at a higher price than the first rental? He replied, "There is nothing wrong with that." MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 32 The Limited Partnership Book “AI-Qirad” First chapter Of what is said about the limited partnership 1396) 1 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that his father said: “Abdallah and Oubaidallah, the two sons of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, left with a troop towards Iraq. Once back, they passed by Abu Musa Al-Ach'ari, who was the governor in Basrah, who welcomed them cordially. Then he said to them: “If I could be of any use to you, I would have made". Then he continued: “I keep on me a certain amount of money forming part of the public treasury, which I intend to send to the prince of the believers. I deliver it to you, with which, you can buy goods from Iraq, which you will sell in Medina. Thus you will give to the prince of the believers the capital of the money, and you will have the benefit of it”. They replied, "We want to do that." He gave them the money, and sent in writing to Umar Ibn Al-Khattab, to receive the money from them. Once they arrived (in Medina) they sold the merchandise, and made a profit. They gave Umar the sum of money, he said to them: "Did he act similarly, with all the troop of the army, as he did with you"? They replied, “No”. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab resumed: “As you two are the sons of the prince of the believers, he acted in this way with you. Give me the capital of money and its profit”. While Abdallah was silent, Oubaidallah, said, “Why do you act this way, O prince of believers? If the money had diminished or was lost, we would be obliged to insure it.” Omar resumed: “Give it then”. Abdallah always kept silent Oubaidallah proposed to his father to reflect; immediately one of Omar's companions said, "O prince of the believers, and if you made this money, a capital of a limited partnership "Al-Qirad", to which Omar replied, "Yes I will do so". So Omar took the capital and half of the profit, and the other half was the share of his two sons Oubaidallah and Abdallah". 
(1397) 2 - Al-'Ala Ibn Abdul Rahman reported according to his grandfather that Osman Ibn Affan had given him a limited sum of money, to be used in trade, on condition that the profit be shared between them”. Chapter II What is allowed in the limited partnership 
(1398) 3 Malek said, “Sponsorship is permitted when a limited partner gives a capital to a general partner in order to use it in trade, without the latter wishing to insure it. Subsequently what the general partner will spend during his trip, and for his food and for his clothes and in case the capital is portable and of sufficient value, will be taken from the capital. Thus, if the general partner is resident in his country, he will not be entitled to any capital expenditure, not even for his clothes”. - Malek said, “It is tolerated that sponsor and general partner suitably agree if there are no stipulations on either side. The sponsor can buy whatever he wants from the general partner, for merchandise, if the sale is made normally, without being subject to a condition. - Malek added: “He who advances to a man and to a slave, a capital, in order to use it in trade, there is no harm in that, and it is permissible because the profit accrues to the servant and not to his master, as long as he is taken for a general partner who is entitled to profit". Chapter III What is prohibited in the limited partnership 
(1399) 4 - Malek said, "If a man owes a another, a debt, about which, he asks him to keep it in the form of a capital of a "quirad" limited partnership, this is not allowed, except in the case where he will have received his money after which he may either consider it limited capital or the keep. This must be done lest the debtor find himself in difficulty and delay payment for a certain period, wishing later to pay it off with a profit (and this will be usury). About a man who paid another a sum of money for a "quirad" limited partnership, of which part of the money is lost before it bears fruit and by using the remaining part, he has made a profit and the general partner asks the limited partner to consider the part which remained, as new capital before using it in trade- Malek said: “what is said is not accepted, and the general partner must pay the lost amount of his profit, then he shares with the limited partner the rest of the benefit, according to the condition which they have advanced". Malek further said, "The capital of a limited partnership should be only silver or gold, and never any commodity or commercial transaction which causes dispute between them. As for usury, it is absolutely forbidden, and it is never permissible to take it whatever its amount, because Allah the Blessed and the Most High has said (meaning): "If you repent , your capital will be preserved. Harm no one and you will not be harmed” Koran II, 279. Chapter IV Stipulations permitted in a limited partnership 
(1400) 5 - Concerning the man who shed to another a sum of money in the form of a limited partnership, subjecting him to the condition of buying himself with the sum which is specific to him only such and such a commodity or even that he prohibits him from buying a specific commodity Malek said: “Whoever submits the general partner, on the condition, of not to buy with this sum of money, neither an animal, nor a well determined commodity, that is tolerated; on the other hand, it is not tolerated that the sponsor prevents the general partner from buying such or such merchandise, except if the latter is abundant, and that it is not not hard to find in winter and summer, so it will be tolerated. - "About a man, who pays another a limited sum, subjecting it to the condition, to share in a partial profit, regardless of the total profit,” Malek said: "this is not allowed, even if it is a profit of a single dirham, because the profit is to be shared equally, half of which must legally go to the sponsor unless the profit is set to him by a third or of a quarter, or less or more than this proportion. Any benefit whose proportion is fixed, is therefore lawful, therefore such is what which is basically followed in a limited partnership between Muslims. And Malek added: “But if the sponsor advances as a condition, that the profit therefrom is one dirham or more, going to him alone independently of the part of the general partner, and that the rest of the profit is shared equally between them, this is not tolerated, and it is not an established foundation in the partnership between Muslims”. Chapter V What is prohibited as a condition in a limited partnership 
(1401) 6 - Malek said: "It is not the right of the owner of the capital to appropriate a partial gain, by not making not a part to the general partner, nor that the latter cannot do this. In a limited partnership, neither the limited partner nor the general partner has the right to submit to each other any condition of sale or lease or of any work or advance or even a business without a mutual agreement. But this is permitted when both agree on this subject, without being subject to any condition, therefore it must be done for good, and that this is agreed for both partners. On the other hand, neither the principal, nor the general partner, has the right to subject the other to the condition, to have more than his partner, as far as gold is concerned, or to money, or food, or any other such thing, in the sense that one will have more than his partner. And Malek explains: if the sum in sponsorship is affected by this or that aspect (cited above), it will turn out to be a wage earner that demands what is stable, what is determined. It is not no no longer allowed to the one who receives the capital, to have it, by having a reward, neither to entrust his merchandise to someone, nor to entrust it to himself. If the money has increased in such a way that the capital is already reserved, sponsor and general partner must share between them, according to the condition on which both have agreed the profit. But if the money has yielded no profit, or even the price of the goods sold has not recovered the capital, the general partner is entitled to nothing, namely neither of what he has done as expenses personal, nor of the loss suffered, and it is up to the sponsor alone to bear this loss. The limited partnership is permitted as long as the owner of the capital (limited partner) and general partner, have agreed on the sharing of the profit, namely or that it is equal, or fixed at one-third or one-fourth, or more or less than that”. - Malek said: "It is not permitted for the general partner to put forward the condition of profiting from the capital for several years without being required to pay it. It's not allowed either the limited partner to ask the general partner to reimburse him the capital within a time limit that they both set; because the limited sum must never be given for a term. However, the owner of the capital can give his money to the general partner in order to grow it for him; but in case one of them wants the contract terminated and the capital is still liquid the owner of the capital can have his money again. On the other hand, that the owner of the capital wants to recover his money after a commodity has been bought with it, this is only permitted if the sale price and the capital are in cash. Else share if the general partner wants to return the capital in the form of a commodity, before selling it, this is not allowed to him, because he must return the capital in the form of cash”. Malek also said: it is not tolerated that the sponsor conditions the general partner to pay zakat in respect of his own share of the gain, because if the sponsor had acted thus, he should have seized a fixed sum of his own gain, making himself exempt from the zakat which he actually had to pay on his own. It is also not tolerated that the limited partner requires that the general partner only buys from such or such merchant, that he will designate. This is therefore not tolerated because the general partner becomes an employee who does not know his salary”. - Malek said again: “It is not tolerated yet that the limited partner subject the general partner to the condition of giving him a guarantee of the capital that he has paid to him, because he will have thus requested this which is not agreed in the limited partnership and what is the practice of Muslims. However, if the capital has suffered a increase, his winning percentage would have increased further because of this guarantee. However, they must share the gain without any guarantee of either one or the other. And if this money is for any reason lost, the general partner will not assume any responsibility, because any condition in a limited partnership is considered null and void”. - Malek, finally, said: "If the sponsor pays the general partner a certain sum, requiring him to buy only palm trees or animals, with the aim that this sponsor wants the date palms and the evolution of the beasts, withholding them for some time, Malek said, “This is intolerable, and also is not what is practiced by Muslims in a limited partnership except, s 'he buys this commodity and then resells it like any other commodity'. However, it is tolerated that the general partner asks the owner of the capital, a servant to help him in the operations of the company and not to other purpose. Chapter VI The limited partnership when capital is commodity 
(1402) 7 - Malek said: “It is not tolerated, in a limited partnership, that the capital be other than money, thus excluding all merchandise, because if the capital is merchandise, it will have two aspects: either that he says to the general partner: “Take this commodity and sell it, and from the sale price you will buy another commodity, as agreed in the limited partnership”. Now, in this way, the sponsor would have earned a surplus by selling his merchandise, by having possessed enough, what he needs”; or even that he says to the general partner: "Sell this merchandise at a price, buy another then resell it, once the purchase and sale are perfectly accomplished, buy merchandise similar to that which I had, consequently this who is of a certain surplus will be shared equally between the two of us. And it is likely that the sponsor has given the general partner such a flowing and expensive commodity, as a result of which the general partner will buy himself a similar commodity, the price of which is less, so that this commodity will be purchased at a third of the previous price, or even less, Thus, the general partner will have enjoyed a profit coming from half of the difference of the two prices, or that he will have bought the goods at a reduced price which, put on the market, will bring to the general partner a valuable profit, then he will wait for the price of this commodity to rise so that he can pay it, and will spend what he has received as a gain, thus making all his work vain. Such a sale is held for random; however if this affair is unknown to the sponsor and the general partner, and that it has been accomplished until the end, the salary which is due to the general partner for having carried out, purchase and sale, and for his maintenance of the goods, will be considered, and we owe it to him pay. As for the commodity, which has become cash, this is taken for new capital”. Chapter VII Transport costs in a limited partnership 
(1403) 8 - “For a sponsor who had paid a sum to his partner to buy a commodity, and that the latter transported it to a market, there was a risk that the commodity would be lost, or even sold at a price less than that of the purchase , so he went and carried her to another country, paying the transportation costs. There, by selling the merchandise, at a price less than that of the purchase, the transport costs will have eaten up all the capital. In this regard, Malek said, “If the sale price is worth the sum of the transport costs, so it will be. But if the costs exceed by their value, that of the capital, the general partner will have to pay without the limited partner paying an additional sum, because he had already advanced a certain capital to the general partner in order to use it in trade. The general partner may not, whatever the condition, ask the limited partner for more than the capital he had paid, and if it is the case that the latter must anything else, it will be held as a debt that he will have to pay, which is unseemly. Chapter VIII The transgressed terms of the limited partnership 
(1404) 9 - "About a sponsor who had paid his partner a sum, which used in trade brings him a profit, from which he bought a slave whom he had cohabited and thereby became pregnant, therefore the capital was diminished”; Malek said: “If the general partner has money, the value of this slave is to be removed from the money in question, so that the sum of the capital which is missing, is rectified. If there is anything left over, it will be shared between them as agreed. If the general partner does not have the money to pay it, the slave is sold so that the capital is recovered from its price”. - About a man who gives capital to a general partner, and the latter buys a commodity whose price exceeds by its value that of the capital, and therefore pays this price difference itself”. Malek on this subject says: “The owner of the capital will have to choose: if the commodity is sold at a profit or at a loss or even that it is not sold, he will be able to have it by paying its price or on the other hand, if he refuses it, the general partner will be his associate for this merchandise in question according to his share of the price which he has already paid, whether that portion be increased or diminished, taking into account the sum which was paid out of his own money. - About a general partner who, receiving a capital on the other, the book to a third party, without having had the sponsor's permit, Malek said: “The general partner must guarantee the capital, such that, if it decreases, it must cover this decrease, and in the event that he benefits, the limited partner will be partially entitled to this benefit, according to the condition advanced, and the rest will go to the general partner”. - About a general partner who had received capital of a limited partner, from which he had bought himself a commodity of his own, Malek said, "If he has a profit, it will be shared according to the terms of the limited partnership, and if he loses, the general partner will assume responsibility for such loss”. - In the event that a general partner asks the limited partner to advance him a sum other than the capital to buy a commodity for himself, the limited partner will have two choices: either that he is a partner of this commodity with the general partner according to what is agreed in the limited partnership, or let him leave it to her, returning to her all the sum he had paid her. Besides, this is how we should deal with those who transgress the terms of a limited partnership”. Chapter IX Expenses allowed in a limited partnership (14
(15) 10 Malek said: “When the sponsor pays a capital of a large sum and that the general partner travels the travel expenses are taken there, the general partner can obtain his food and his clothes according to what suits him, just as he can have a certain sum for the expenses miscellaneous corresponding to certain work which is due to him such as: claiming debts, transporting goods and other similar work. Thus he can use this money as long as it is necessary. However, the general partner does not have the right to deduct any sum from the capital as long as he is still at home, without being a traveller. If so thus, he will not be entitled to any additional expense for his clothes, because he will use the money of the trade, in the place where he is resident”. On the other hand, Malek said: “If the general partner travels with the capital on him of the limited partnership and also his own money, his expenses are to be considered as two sums and this in a manner proportional to their amount”. ChapterX What Expenses Are Not Allowed in a Limited Partnership 
(1406) 11 - “Malek said: “In case the general partner travels while having on him the capital of a limited partnership, he will be able to spend what he needs as a sum and buy clothes. However, he is prohibited from making a donation of this capital. or an alms or a reward to someone. But if he is with people, who will bring food just as he himself will bring it for them to eat together, I believe, said Malek, that the general partner has the right to do so provided he does not seek to obtain food that is much more valued than that others, and this without having had the permit of its sponsor. Because if he refuses, the general partner will have to pay him compensation, if this thing deserves to be done”. Chapter XI The practice of debt on the capital of a limited partnership 
(1407) 12 - Malek said: “What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), in the event that the general partner receives capital from the sponsor, thus buys goods and resells it in the long term to a third person, thus benefiting from a profit, then that this general partner dies before recovering the debt”, Malek said, “If his heirs are willing to take on this matter, but on the condition of still having the benefit which is their father's right, they may do so, if they show fidelity; but if they refuse to take responsibility for the recovery of the debt, thus leaving the task to the sponsor, they may still do so, without their having any right to it. If they intend to undertake debt collection themselves, they will be substituted for their father and will thereby enjoy the same rights of the contract and the expense. Just as they can instruct someone else they trust to claim the debt and perceive; consequently, the office being accomplished, they will be able to enjoy the same rights as their father”. Malek further said: “When a general partner sells the commodity forward, he will have to guarantee this debt”. Chapter Xn Merchandise in a limited partnership 
(1408) 13 - "About a limited partner who pays a general partner a capital, and that both borrow money (sum independent of the capital) or that the limited partner asks his partner to sell for him a commodity that he owns, or also that he gives him dinars with which the general partner will buy goods for the sponsor, Malek said: "The sponsor would not have charged his partner with a purchase and a sale if he had not not delivered a capital, friendly asking him to do so and finding it easy to do, but if the general partner refuses to undertake it, the limited partner will not have the right to take back his capital from this partner, and the latter will not have to borrow from the other nor will agree to sell him a commodity, knowing full well that he has no capital; on the other hand, if the general partner refuses to take charge of both the purchase and the sale, he is not obliged to return the capital of the limited partnership. However, if it is done, that both have agreed on what is suitable and for one and the other, without this being a condition, this is therefore permitted and tolerated. But if any condition appears in such a way that the general partner risks reimbursing the limited partner the capital in the event that he refuses what the limited partner instructs him to do, or that the limited partner fears that the general partner will not return his capital to him, this does not is more permissible in a limited partnership and it is what men versed in religion have forbidden to do”. Chapter XIII The advance made in a limited partnership 
(1409) 14 - Concerning a man who pays to another a sum of money on loan, and the latter requests that this sum be made a capital of a limited partnership, Malek said: "I disapprove of this, and the debtor must first discharge this that he borrowed, since the sponsor has the choice, either to return it to him as capital or to retain it". - Malek also said: “If a sponsor gives a capital to the general partner, and that the latter then tell him that the money is on him, to leave it to him in the form of a loan, Malek, says this, is disapproved, as long as the limited partner has not yet taken back all his capital, following which, if he wishes, he can either return it to the general partner or keep it for himself. This must be done, to avoid any risk that the money will be diminished and that the general partner only asks for this in order to delay the payment in order to be able to cover the deficit. Now, this is repugnant, not permitted and forbidden”. Chapter XIV Accounting in a limited partnership 
(1410) 15 - "About a sponsor who, paid a capital to a general partner, in such a way that the latter, using it in trade, wanted to have his share of the gain, in the absence of the general partner, Malek said: "It is not permitted for the general partner to having a share of the money while the limited partner is away; in case he will, this must be guaranteed so that this sum will be part of the money, once it is divided”. - Also, Malek said, "You don't have to have both partners count and share, while the money is not available to them. Once the money is there, the limited partner will take part of his capital, then afterwards he will share with the general partner the gain according to the condition accepted by one and the other”. - Malek further said, “Once a general partner has received a capital, with which he bought a commodity, and has a debt to pay, which his creditors claim from him, and which they cross the general partner in a country where the general partner does not reside, this done, the debtor general partner having in his possession good and beneficial merchandise to sell, the creditors will not have the right to impose on the general partner the sale of this merchandise for the purpose to have their debt recovered from the profit of this sale, as long as the limited partner is not present to have his capital, after which the profit will be shared according to the condition admitted by him and the general partner. - Malek added: “Whether a sponsor pays to a general partner a sum which, put on the market, brings to the latter a profit, thus bringing the general partner to set aside the capital, then to share the profit, so as to have one's share, and to add that of the limited partner to its capital in the presence of witnesses. On this subject Malek said: “The profit should not be shared without the owner of the capital being present; if the general partner had already had any share, he must return it until the limited partner has recovered his capital, then the two will share, what remains, according to the condition accepted by them”. - Malek finally said: “In case a sponsor after having given a capital to the general partner which he has used in trade, that the latter comes to say to the first: "Such is your share of the profit, and I have had a similar share, and also your capital is well reserved," Malek said, "I do not approve of this, until all the capital is fully available, so he will account to him until the capital is within reach of the hand of the sponsor, knowing thus, that he has it in full and that he even received it, after which they will share the profit between them. the sponsor can return the capital to the general partner or he can keep it, but what is necessary is to have all the capital for fear that the general partner has reduced it, especially since he wants us to do not take it away from him, and let him keep it within his reach”. Chapter XV About the limited partnership 
(1411) 16 - About a general partner who has bought with a capital received from a sponsor, a commodity, which the latter requires him to sell against what the general partner opposes, and which consequently causes them to enter into dispute, Malek said: "It is not necessary that 'we listen to one without the other, it is better to ask experts for their points of view; thus if they judge that the goods should be sold, let it be so for both; if they think it is better to wait, let them wait”. - Malek said: “In the event that a general partner has put in trade a capital, which is delivered to him by a sponsor, and that the latter claims it from him, to which the other replies: "I have it in whole"; the limited partner insisting on having his capital, the general partner says to him: “I lost of this capital such sum, which he quotes, and I told you that I have it so that you still leave it with me", Malek finds that it is necessary to take into account the first answer of the general partner, namely where it is said that he owns all the capital, because it is useless for him to disown it afterwards, unless he does not advance compelling arguments justifying the cause of the loss; otherwise he must pay all the capital”. It is the same, continues Malek, if the general partner had made a profit of such sum; and once the sponsor claims his capital and his gain, the other responds: "In fact, I have not benefited anything, and I do not had said that so that you let me keep this capital; here again, it is not good for him to contradict himself if he does not put forward valid arguments justifying the cause of the loss”. - Malek also said: “In the event that a general partner, benefiting from a sum coming to him from a capital which is delivered to him by a sponsor, will go and say to the latter: "I have requested this sum to trade, on condition that I receive two-thirds of the profit", and the sponsor replies: "No, I paid you this money to trade on the condition that you only have a third of it", it is necessary, says Malek, to be for what is proposed by the general partner, and he will have to take an oath proving his presumption, namely that he wants to hear that such is the custom followed between both partners and which, moreover, is practiced by people. Otherwise, neither his words nor his oath will be given importance, and he is responsible for returning the capital to the limited partner with the profit, according to what is usually practiced for a similar general partnership business”. - On the other hand, about a sponsor who has given to a general partner one hundred dinars, with which he will buy goods. When paying the seller for the merchandise, he realizes that the hundred dinars have been stolen, the sponsor offers the general partner to sell this merchandise, and to take the price of what is sold plus the profit that would come out of it, and s there is a loss will be the general partner to cover the money lost. However, to this the general partner replied: "Rather, it is up to the roof to pay the price of this merchandise that I bought with your money. Malek on this subject says: "In fact it is up to the general partner to pay the price to the seller, and the sponsor is asked: "or that you give the general partner the hundred dinars and that the goods are for both of you, therefore these new hundred dinars will be new capital according to the terms of the first contract, or that you give up the goods. So if he pays the hundred dinars to the general partner, this sum will be considered a new capital according to the conditions of the first contract, and if he refuses, the goods are the property of the general partner and it is up to him to pay his price”. - Malek finally said: “If he stays, after payment of capital and sharing of profit, junk, it is up to the general partner. And I haven't heard otherwise. But if what remains is of the value of an animal, or a camel, or garments of coarse material, or the like, the general partner shall have to return them to the limited partner, unless the latter gives them to him. leave alone". MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 33 The Watering Contract Book First chapter About watering 
(1412) 1 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said, on the day of the conquest of Khaibar, to the jews: “I keep you in this territory as long as Allah Him the power and the glory grant it to you, provided that the dates are divided between us”. The rapporteur adds: "And the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be grace and peace of Allah) sent Abdallah Ibn Rawaha, instructing him to be in Khaibar to estimate the quantity of dates, and he said to the Jews: "If you want to keep the dates, you can buy our share, if not, we will have them and we will give you half”; but the Jews preferred to have them”. 
(1413) 2 - Sulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) sent to Khaibar Abdallah Ibn Rawaha, instructing him to estimate the picking of dates and its sharing with the Jews. One day, continues the reporter, the Jews brought him their wives' jewels, saying: "This is for you, if you give us a discount and give us more than half". So Abdallah said to them, “O Jews! By Allah, you are the most hideous creatures towards me. However, that will not cause me to be unfair to you, because it is only an illegal bribe that we will hardly eat”. They answered him: "In fact, it is according to this justice that the earth and heavens have been established”. - Malek said: “In case the man waters palm groves where a part is fallow, what he plants and harvests there will be for him". Also, if the owner of the land wants any new plantation to belong to him, this is not accepted, because the man who has been entrusted with the watering will be charged with an additional work, not belonging to the advanced condition”. ^ On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with the harvest is shared if the expenses of the seed, watering and maintenance costs are borne by the partner. In case the partner stipulates to the owner of the land, the condition that the price of the semen is borne by the latter, this is not accepted, because in this way the partner would have charged the owner of an expense considered surplus on capital. The watering and sowing contract obliges the partner to assume all the expenses without the owner of the land taking charge of anything. Besides, such is what is decent in a contract”. - If a water source is the possession of two men, and that its water dries up, and that one of the two men wants to get its water, by accomplishing some work there to recover this water, while the other refuses it, one will say to the first: “You have to dig so that you have all the water you need to water your land. If your partner comes to claim his share of water, you you will ask him for half of the payment that the work cost if he ever accepts, he will have his share of water, otherwise you will have the whole quantity. - If all fees and expenses are borne by the owner of the garden and that the partner will only have his manual work in this garden in respect of which he will have a share of the harvest, this is not tolerated because the salary of the partner is not specified and he will not know whether or not he will have his full mail-order pay at harvest”. - Neither the sponsor nor the person who makes a contract for watering and sowing to make an exception for a sum of money, nor for certain palm trees, without either of them approving it because in this case, one would be considered an employee with respect to the other, namely that the owner of the capital will say to the other: “I conclude a contract with you on the condition that you take care of the palm trees, water them and pollenize them; and I will pay you another ten dinars if you work and this money will not be part of the capital”, Malek said: “It is not allowed and this is what is done here”. - What is a rule put into practice in the watering contract is to allow the owner of the garden to stipulate to his partner the insurance of works such as: firmly maintaining the walls, cleaning the water source, getting rid of stagnant water around the palm trees , to pollinate palm trees, to cut dry branches, to pick dates, and to do other such work. However the partner will have in this case, half of the harvest or less according to what is dictated in this contract, or even more, if they agree on this point. On the other hand, the owner of the garden may not impose other additional work on his partner such as digging a well, or raising water from a spring, or planting trees by paying their price, or building a rampart around it. 'a basin of water, in short, expensive work. This case is equivalent to that of an owner of a garden asking a person to build him a house in a specific place, or to drill him a well, or to dig him a source of water or other work, in exchange for which he will have half the quantity of the fruits of his garden, even before they are matured and consumable. It will be like a sale of the fruits before they are in question, but this is what has been forbidden by the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam). - However, if the fruits are already ripe and they are for sale or consumption, it is tolerated for a man to say to another: "Do some work for me (cited above), specifying them, and you will have half the quantity of the fruits of my garden" , for thus, he would have charged him with work for wages determined, which he has known and accepted. As for the watering contract, in case the garden has no more fruit trees or even the fruits have diminished or are ravaged, under the effect of a plague, the partner will only have what is his right to harvest. A man can only be recruited for a well-defined job, because recruitment is considered the same as a sale, where one buys his work from the worker, and this is not tolerated, if done randomly, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has forbidden the random sale”, i - The rule followed in the watering contract is that it depends on fruit trees such as palms, vines, olives, pomegranates, plums and other such trees. This is tolerated on condition that the owner has half the quantity of the fruit, or a third or a quarter, or more or less”. - It is also allowed in the watering contract, as soon as a plantation grows and becomes robust that the owner is incapable of watering it, working it, and caring for it". - However, the watering contract is inadmissible, once the fruits or other kinds of crops become ripe, edible and satisfactory for sale, but it may, if necessary, be concluded for a following year. Thus in the previous case, as soon as the fruits become ripe, the owner can pay the other person a salary, in gold or silver, so that he cuts the date palms for him. Therefore the watering contract is permitted during the period of the cut, and the time when the fruits will be ripe and ready to be sold”. - Also the watering contract is tolerated, when it it is the watering of trees whose fruits are not yet ripe and edible and good for sale”. - On the other hand, it is not tolerated to conclude a watering contract for unsown or planted land; however, it is tolerated for its owner to return the soil, for a price paid in gold or silver or at another known price”. - Likewise, let a man deliver his unsown land or planted to another to sow it against the third or quarter of the crop that might be produced, this is considered random, because it may be that the plantation pays or it may yield nothing at all. Thus, the owner of the land will have neglected the rental who could make his land fertile, preferring what is random, while not knowing whether this will happen or not; but this is repugnant, because the case of this proprietor is like that of a man who engages another for a certain journey, saying to him: "do you want me to give you the tenth of the profit of my trade, as wages"? This is neither lawful nor tolerated”. - It is not tolerated for a man to engage in any work, or to hire his land or his ship, except for a specified sum". - And, says Malek, it is to be distinguished between the watering contract concluded for a land planted with palm trees, and that which is for an unplanted land; thus the owner of the first will not be able to sell the fruits until they appear ripe; as for the other, he will be able to cultivate his land as long as it is not not yet planted. - The rule followed in Medina makes it possible to conclude a watering contract for three or four years, or even more or less for palm trees, for that matter, said Malek, that's what I heard at the subject to such a contract concerning palm trees and any other fruit tree where the owner is permitted to conclude, for years, a watering contract". - Regarding the owner of a garden, Malek has said, that he is not permitted to take from his partner who gave him water, nor gold, nor silver, nor food, nor something else, because it is not tolerated. Likewise, it is not permissible for the partner giving the water, to take from his partner neither gold, nor silver, nor food, nor anything like that. As for what is surplus, for one and for the other, it is not allowed either”. - Similarly, says Malek, the sponsor is treated just like the one who gives water, if ever there is a surplus in the watering, or even that the sponsored sum turns out to be a salary, moreover, everything that will bring into play, a salary, n 'East not tolerated, especially since this salary is considered random. And, we will not know if we will have the whole harvest, or more or less”. - Concerning the man, who concludes a contract irrigation, for a man's land, where the palms and vines or other similar trees are, and there is a part of the uncultivated land, Malek said, "If the part not planted is auxiliary to that which is planted and which moreover constitutes the major part of the land, there is nothing wrong with that, provided that the part planted with palm trees is two-thirds or more, and that which is not, either by a third or at least. Thereby if the uncultivated part forms the two-thirds where the palms, vines or other similar trees are, it is tolerated that one pays a salary for watering without there being a contract which is prohibited. Because it is customary for people to conclude a watering contract when it comes to land where the planted part is major, while it contains an uncultivated part. He is allowed to rent uncultivated land, against payment, even if it contains a planted part, just as one sells the Koran or the sword while each having a silver ornament, or even the medallion or the ring encrusted with precious stones, sold for gold. And such sales are practiced by people, as well as purchases, without any specific criteria (inspired by the Koran or the sunna) being advanced on this subject, stipulating that, when the main material constitutes half or less, this is prohibited; and if she is otherwise, this rental is permitted. The rule followed in Medina, which people from elsewhere do not stop practicing and indulging among themselves, is as follows: if the precious stone in question constitutes only the lower part of the object made of gold or silver , there is no harm in that, such as the case of the sword or the Koran or the ring, valued for more than two thirds, and the adornment for the remaining third or even less”, Chapter II The condition provided about slaves in the watering contract (1414) 3-Malek said: "The best I've heard about the slaves hired by the one who holds the responsibility for watering according to the contract he concludes with the owner of the land, it is that they are taken in the same way as a capital, from which their master will not draw any profit. If he does not make them work, it is up to him to provide them with food, sometimes requiring expenses. excessive. They are considered just like watering from a flowing spring or from the water carried on the backs of camels. And you won't find a man doing a watering contract for two lots bringing the same benefit, so that the first is watered with water from an inexhaustible source, and the other by of water that one draws and where for the first, one pays insignificant expenses to maintain the source, as for the other, that requires excessive expenses. Such is the rule followed in Medina. And by insistence, Malek says: "the inexhaustible source, is that which is not to be perforated, and whose water is always abundant". - It is not permitted for the owner of the land to instruct employees to carry out other work (other than watering) or to ask their partner to do so. Nor is it permissible for the person responsible for the watering to ask the owner of the land to make slaves work there while they were not working according to the contract". - It is not permitted for the owner of the land to ask whoever is responsible for the watering to remove one of the paid slaves during the contract. Thus, if he wants to dismiss it, he must do so before entering into the contract. Consequently, he is not allowed to enlist a new employee, only before concluding the "contract". - In case one of the slaves dies, or is absent or becomes ill, it is up to the owner to find another to replace him". MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 34 The Land Rental Book First chapter About land rental 
(1415) 1 - Rafe' Ibn Khadij reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had prohibited the renting of lands which are for cultivation”. Hanzala, reporting this hadith, said: “I had asked Rafé Ibn Khadij about the rent, if it is paid in gold or silver, he answered me: “Either one or the other, there is no harm”. 
(1416) 2 - Ibn Chehab reported that he asked Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab about paying for land rental; gold or silver? He replied, “There is nothing wrong with that”. 
(1417) 3 - Ibn Chehab reported that he asked Salem Ibn Abdallah Ibn Omar about renting the land”? He replied, "There is no harm in it being done for gold or silver”. Ibn Chehab added: "I said to him: what are you saying concerning the hadith narrated by Rafé Ibn Khadij”? He replied, “Rafe' explained this hadith incorrectly. If I had land to cultivate, I would have rented it”. 
(1418) 4 - It was reported to Malek that Abdul Rahman Ibn Awf had rented land; he kept it that way until his death. His son has said, “I thought we owned her because of long time she was with us, until my father mentioned it to us just when he died; thus, he ordered us to pay the rent he owed, in gold or silver”. 
(1419) 5 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father rented his land for gold or silver”. Malek was asked about a man who rented his farm, percent sa's of dates, or even for what it will produce of wheat, or other crop". Malek pushed that back. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 35 The Book of Preemption First chapter What is subject to preemption 
(1420) 1 - Abu Salama Ibn Abdul Rahman Ibn Awf reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) commanded that preemption be applied in all that was not divided between the partners, but if the delimitation of the shares has already taken place, there is no longer any question of pre-emption”. Malek said, "Such is the sunna unquestionably followed." 
(1421) 2 - Malek reported that Sa'id Ibn al Musaiab was asked about pre-emption, if there is a followed Sunnah He replied: "Yes, certainly, pre-emption is to be applied in dwellings and lands, and is only proper to partners". 
(1422) 3 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab narrated the same hadith». Malek said: "If a man, in a country, buys a part of a property in association by paying with an animal, or a slave or other goods, and that a partner comes to claim this share, according to the right of pre-emption, and finds that the slave is dead, without the two parties can specify its value, and that therefore the buyer says: "The value of this slave is one hundred dinars", against which the entitled partner says: "Rather it is fifty", Malek said: " The buyer will make an oath that the price of what he has bought is one hundred dinars, then will ask, if he wants, the one who has the right to pre-emption, to leave what is bought or to take, until the latter can provide clear proof that the price of the slave is lower than what is said by the buyer". - “Whoever donates part of a house or of land belonging to several partners, to a third person who in exchange gives him money or other goods, the partners can if they want to take back this part under pre-emption, and consequently pay this third person the value of the donation, either in dinars or in dirhams”. - One who donates his share in a house, or land belonging to several partners, without him changing it or claiming it, and his partner telling him that he wants to have it according to his own value, that is not permitted, as long as he has not changed it, but this done, this part will be given to him who has the right to pre-emption, at his same value”. - About a man who bought a share in a land belonging to several partners, for a term price, and one of the partners asks to take it back by right of preemption", Malek said: "If he is solvent, he has the right to preemption, but if he runs the risk of not being able to pay the price within the fixed period, that he presents a solvent guarantor, that is permitted to him”. - Malek said, "A man's right of first refusal absent cannot be limited to a fixed date, although his absence is long-lasting, and this is what we follow at all times in Medina”. - For a man, who gives to some of his son, his land as an inheritance, and that one of them will have other children then the father dies. If one of these last children wants to sell his share of this land, his brothers will have more than the paternal uncles, partners of this land with the father, the right to pre-emption. And such is the rule followed in Medina”. - Malek further said: - The right of pre-emption between the partners, is proportional to the value of their shares: each of them will be entitled to his share whether it is little or a lot, even if they seek to have some reduced compared to others. So if one of the partners buys the share of the other, and another partner says: I buy a share equivalent to mine, by right of first refusal, then the buying partner says: "If you want, I let you have, by right of first refusal, all the shares, or you can leave them to me. This being advanced by the buyer, the partner must either have all the shares, or else leave them. If he buys, it is his right, otherwise he has no right to anything”. - Concerning the man who buys land, makes it plant or even dig a well there, and then there comes a man who claims by the right of first refusal, this land, and wants to have it, but he will not have it until he has paid the other, the value of the work expenses; if this value is paid, he will have the land by right of pre-emption, otherwise he will have no right”. - He who sells his share in land or house owned by partners, and once the partner with the right of first refusal has been made aware, and the buyer wants to resolve the purchase agreement and the first accepts, Malek said: “He has no right to do so, and whoever has the right of first refusal can take it back at the same price that was paid”. - One who buys a share in land, or a remains or animals or other goods, of a single transaction, and that the partner having the right of pre-emption claims his share in everything, the buyer to respond to him: “You have to buy everything at once because I already bought everything,” Malek said: “Rather the partner must buy his share of the abode or land, estimating thereby that share independently of other things sold, thus taking account of the price which has been paid. Then the partner will have his share of what has been estimated, once the price has been paid, without having any rights with regard to the others. goods or animals, unless he so wishes". - When a man sells his share in land which belongs to several partners, also delivering some shares of partners to the seller, as for others, refusing this, insist on having, according to the right of pre-emption, their own shares; thus, these partners who have refused, can, and always according to the right of preemption, have all the shares, without them being satisfied with the proportion of their share, and consequently abandoning what remains”. About the plurality of partners having a only remains, if one of them sells his share while his partners were all absent, with the exception of only one, who, so to speak, or offered him to have, by right of first refusal, this share or to leave it, and that he answers: "I will have my share, and I leave the others to my partners waiting for them to be present. Thus, if they take their shares, it will be so, if not, I will take, by right of pre-emption, all the shares. Malek said: “He can only either have the whole thing, or the to leave; thus, if his partners present themselves, they can claim it from him, or leave it to him. However, if ever this is offered to him, and he refuses it, I, continues Malek, think that he no longer has the right to withdraw. Chapter II What is not subject to the right of preemption 
(1423) 4 - Abu Bakr Ibn Hazm reported that Osman Ibn Affan said: "If the delimitation of the land has already been made, it is no longer subject to the right of first refusal; no right of first refusal with regard to a well or a male palm tree”. Malek, on this subject, said: “Such is the rule followed in Medina”. * Malek said: * Preemption is not invoked for a road suitable for dividing or not; the same applies to a common forecourt between several dwellings, divisible or not”. * About a man who buys a share of a land belonging to several partners, in such a way that he is given the choice. If the seller's partners want to have what he has sold, and refer to the right of pre-emption before the buyer has to choose, they cannot allow themselves this right as long as the purchase and sale have not been definitely completed; thus, if the sale is made, they will act according to the right of pre-emption”. * Concerning the man who buys land now for some time in his possession; then came another telling him that he has the right to inherit this land; Malek said: “He will have the right to pre-emption, if he proves to have the right. As for the harvesting of the land, it must revert to the first buyer, until the other has proved his right, because the first buyer had already guaranteed the planting, if ever it had been ravaged. or uprooted by a torrent". But if a long time had passed, or the witnesses were dead, or that the seller or the buyer was dead, or that they were alive, but the sale and purchase price had been completely forgotten for lack of time, the right of pre-emption is broken and everyone will have their right. If the case were to be considered otherwise, depending on whether the time is sooner or later, and it is realized that the seller had secretly kept the real price with the aim of depriving the other of the right to pre-emption, we will make the valuation of the land, for a new price in relation to the first, then one will consider what has been added to this land, of construction or planting or other works, thus the man having the right of preemption , will buy the land, paying the price for the total”. Malek added: “The right of first refusal is at consider in the property of the dead as well as in that of the living. Thus, if the relatives of the deceased fear the loss of his property, they can share them and sell them, therefore, the right of first refusal is no longer to be considered”. - However, continues Malek, we never consider the right of pre-emption in respect of a slave, female or male, nor a camel, a cow, a sheep or any other animal, or a garment or a well in a uncultivated land; on the other hand, the right of preemption is considered in what is to be shared, and what is delimited in a land; and if it is the contrary, this does not call no right of first refusal". Eventually Malek said, "Whoever buys land where people have a right of pre-emption, and they are present, they have to bring this matter to the sultan; so, or they deserve it by their right of pre-emption, or that the sultan deliver their share to the buyer. If he leaves them without referring to the sultan when they are aware of this purchase, if they leave for a long time after which, they claim their right, I think they will have no more right to do it) MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 36 The Book of Sentences First chapter The exhortation to judge fairly 
(1424) 1 - Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet (upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) said, “I am a human being. When you report your accusations to me, one of you may skillfully present his case to me, to such an extent that I agree with him on something of his brother's good. So let him not take it, because indeed, I only give him a piece of Hell”. 
(1425) 2 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab reported that a Muslim and a Jew, disputed between them, brought their accusation to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab. Finding that the Jew was right, Omar judged in his favour. So the Jew exclaimed, "By Allah, you have judged in all justice", Omar gave him a whipping, saying: "How do you know that"? The Jew replied, "We find that no judge gives his judgment in justice, except that he has an angel at his right hand and one at his left, which put him on the right path, granting him success for justice as long as he is for justice. But, if he leaves justice, they abandon him and return to heaven». Chapter II About testimonials 
(1426) 3 - Zaid Ibn Khaled Al-Jouhani reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Did I not tell you , who is the best martyr? He is the one who presents his testimony before being asked, or the one who declares his testimony before being asked to do so”. 
(1427) 4 - Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdul-Rahman reported that a man from Iraq came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab and said to him: “I come to see you for a question that has no beginning or end”; Umar answered him, “What is this question”? The man replied: "The false testimonies that are present in our country”. Omar asked him: "Is this really so"? - Yes, answered the man. So Umar exclaimed, “By Allah! No man is detained in a country of Islam without the testimony of righteous men”. I (...) 5 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “The testimony of an adversary and an accused is not admitted”. Chapter III The testimony of one who has undergone a prescribed sentence - It was reported to Malek that Sulaiman Ibn was asked Yassar and others, about a man, who having suffered a punishment of flogging, can his testimony be accepted? They replied, "Yes if he showed repentance." (...) 6 - Malek reported that by asking the same question to Ibn Chehab, he responded similarly to Soulaiman Ibn Yassar”. Malek said, "And such is the rule followed in Medina, and it is from the words of Allah Blessed and Most High (meaning): "Knock eighty lashes for those who accuse honest women without being able to designate four witnesses; and never accept their testimony again; these are the ones who are perverse except those who, as a result of this, repent and reform. Allah is verily the One who forgives, He is merciful” (Koran XXIV, 4,5). Malek further said, “So what is indisputable, in Medina, is that he who suffered a punishment of flogging, and after he repented and reformed, his testimony will be admitted. And that's the best I've heard about it." Chapter IV The subject of the judgment based on the oath of a witness 
(1428) 7 Ja'far Ibn Muhammad reported from his father that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) judged according to the oath of the plaintiff and of a witness”. 
(1429) 8 Abu Zinad reported that Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz gives the order in writing to Abdul Hamid Ibn Abdul Rahman Ibn Zaid Ibn Al-Khattab, while the latter was the governor of Kufa: “Judge according to the oath of the plaintiff and of a witness”. 
(1430) 9 It was reported to Malek that Abu Salama Ibn Abdul Rahman and Sulaiman Ibn Yassar were questioned if one could judge according to the oath of the plaintiff and, a witness”? They replied: "Yes". * Malek said: The precedent in the sunna prescribed that one judges according to the oath of the plaintiff and the testimony of only one man, thus if the plaintiff makes an oath with his witness, he is confirmed in his rights. Thus, if the plaintiff renounces the oath and refuses it, the accused is asked to do so, if the latter takes the oath, he is judged innocent, and if he refuses to do so, that proves the plaintiff completely right,'. * However this sunnah is followed for all that is private property; which is not the case for everything concerning delimitation (of land), nor marriage, nor divorce, nor postage, nor theft, nor defamation. Thus, if one wants to say: "The postage is part of the goods, one will be wrong, because if it is thus, the slave and his witness this one being present would have made an oath, that his master the freed. On the other hand if the slave had had a witness presented, who attests that he is the owner of the money, and that they both make an oath, he will have his full right, just like the case of a man free". ' * Thus, it is from the sunna followed in Medina, in case where a slave presents a witness, who testifies that he has been freed, to bring the master of that slave to swear that he has not freed him if this is done, which the slave claimed to be n' is no longer considered". * It is the same for the sunna followed concerning divorce, thus if the woman presents a witness, attesting thanks to him, that her husband divorced her, her husband will be brought to swear that he has not divorced her; if he does, she will not be divorced”. * Malek continued and said, "There is only one Sunna, , concerning divorce and deliverance, supported by the testimony of one man; the oath shall be made by the husband of the wife, and by the master of the slave, as long as emancipation is one of the prescribed laws and the testimony of the wife on this subject is not tolerated, for if the 'slave is freed, his person will be honest, and will therefore be subject to the same prescribed penalties, just like a free man; if he commits adultery while he is married, he will be stoned; if he kills, he will be killed; he finally has the right to inherit his successors. If one protests by saying: "If ever a man freed his slave, and another came to claim from the master of this slave a debt which the latter owes him, in such a way that he has as witnesses, that he owes him a debt, a man and two women. If the slave has no property, and the man insists on having his debt, the master will be inclined to hold this debt in charge in order to pay it, and therefore postage will no longer be considered. This man who came to claim his debt, sought to bear the testimony of the women, a tolerated testimony about the emancipation; yet their testimony takes into account only the question of the debt. The case of this man is like that which, freeing his slave, a man comes, supported by a witness, swearing to claim a debt which this slave owes him. If this debt is found to be due, postage will no longer be considered. Or even that a man who, having a financial dispute with the master of a slave, comes to claim that he has a debt that the master of the slave must pay him, one will say to this master: "Swear that you don't owe him, what he claims to have in you”; if he renounces and refuses to swear, the plaintiff will be asked to take this oath, which, consequently, by doing so, proves that he is entitled to this debt from the master of the slave. This means that the freeing of the slave is no longer considered, if it is proven that the master owes a debt to the man in question”. - It is the same for the case of a man who marries a slave; having become his wife, her master comes to say to the man: “You bought my slave for so many dinars”; husband denying this slave master appeals to a man and two women testifying and justifying his words. Thus the sale is maintained, the master will have his right, the female slave will be illicit for her husband, and will separate from him. The testimony of women, in the case of a divorce, is not admitted”. - Another example: That a man accuses a free man of slander, so that he ends up being subjected to the prescribed penalty. He calls a man and two women testifying and certifying his words that the accused man is a slave. Thus, the man who has woven the slander, flees the prescribed punishment. The testimony of women is no longer admitted concerning slander”. - Which is still similar to this case, where we emphasizes the discrepancy between the judges and who is from the Sunnah followed, it is when two women testify that a child was born alive, and therefore, he is entitled to inheritance, and will subsequently bequeath his property to his successors. If the boy dies, and the women who have been witnesses, are found unaccompanied by a man, and having not sworn an oath, and let the inheritance be a great fortune consisting of gold, silver, residences, gardens, slaves or other property, therefore the two women who had already testified, of one dirham or more or even less their testimony is not to be considered, if they are not supported, by a man witness and an oath to be made”. - There are some among the people who say that one oath made by a single man witness, is not considered, justifying their protest, relying on what is said by Allah Blessed and Most High (the meaning): "Ask for the testimony of two witnesses among your men. If you cannot find two men, choose a man and two women, among those whom you accept as witnesses” (Koran II, 282). Malek said, "if we don't call in a man and two women to testify the complaining man will not be entitled to anything and therefore, he should not be asked to take an oath with his witness, the complaining man will not be entitled to anything and therefore, he should not be asked to ask to take an oath with his witness". It is from the argument of whoever said this hadith, to say to him: "What do you think of a man who claims to have a debt from another, will not the latter be asked to swear that he owes nothing, so the claim of the other will be Refused; If he renounces swearing, the plaintiff will be asked to take this oath, and then his right will be affirmed. Besides, this is not disputed by anyone, nor in any country. However, which verse of the Book of Allah did he refer to? If he wants to say this, let him do it by appointing his witness who will take the oath, even if it was not mentioned in the Book of Allah. And he is enough to follow the tradition that has been adopted by our ancestors. But the man wants to know what is right and what is argued. And, this is an explanation of what may trouble the mind, if Allah wills it”. Chapter V The judgment concerning the man who dies and leaves a debt to be repaid and another debt which is due to him and having on this subject only one witness (1431) - Malek said: "When a man dies, and that we owe him a debt, and that he has only one witness on this subject, and on the other hand that he owes people a debt, having still only one witness there, then that his heirs refuse to do, with their witness, an oath, not to owe such a debt, creditors are asked to swear to recover what they owe. In this case, if any part of the estate remains, the heirs will have no right to it because they have been called upon to take an oath and have refused it, except that they say: "In our opinion, our deceased n 'left nothing as an inheritance', and we realize that they refused to take an oath because of this. So, in my opinion, they must take such an oath and take the rest after the debt is paid”. Chapter VI Judgment on a lawsuit 
(1432) 10 - Malek reported that Jamil Ibn Abdul Rahman Al-Muezzin shared with Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz the sessions, where he decided controversies between people. In case a man came to claim to have a right from another, Omar took the matter into consideration; thus, if he found that between them, there was a common affair or conjecture, he asked the accused to take an oath, and if he found that there was nothing like it, he did not take not an oath”. Malek said: "That's what we follow at us (in Madinah) namely that, in the event that a man brings an accusation against another, it should be considered in this way, if he finds himself between them a common affair or conjecture, the accused is asked to make an oath; if he does, the charge is no longer considered, on the other hand, if he refuses to do so, deferring the oath to the plaintiff, and the latter takes the oath, he will thus have his full right”. Chapter VII The judgment made on the testimony of the children 
(1433) 11 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that Abdallah Ibn Al-Zouhair took into consideration the testimony of the children, for the common wounds between them”. Malek said, “What is followed (with us) in Medina, it is that the testimony of the children is tolerated between them, for wounds which are common to them, without this being tolerated for others. Thus, their testimony is tolerated, for having had only between them, wounds, and that before they separate, or before they are deceived or even taught. Thus, if they separated, their testimony is no longer considered, except in the case where they declared, before separating, what they had witnessed, to righteous people”. Chapter VIII The violation of the oath before the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) 
(1434) 12 - Jaber Ibn Abdallah Al-Ansari reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Whoever, before my pulpit will make a false oath will have its place in the fire”. 
(1435) 13 - Abu Ummah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Whoever, making a false oath, succeeds in seizing the property of a Muslim, Allah will prohibit him from entering Paradise, and will integrate him into Hell”. He was asked, “Even if it is something insignificant, O Messenger of Allah”? He replied: "Even if it is a simple branch of arak", repeating this for three times". Note: the arak, a kind of shrub, of which we uses branches, in order to make the siwaks, which are used to brush the teeth”. Chapter IX The oath taken before the minbar (the pulpit) 
(1436) 14 - Abu Ghatafan Ibn Tarif Al-Mouri a reported: 'Zaid Ibn Thabet Al-Ansari and Ibn Muti' had argued over a house, they brought their accusation to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam, who was, at that time, the governor of Medina. Marwan asked Zaid Ibn Tabet to take an oath before the pulpit, so Zaid replied, "I will take an oath, from my place." Marwan replied: “No, by Allah! You will only do it before the bench of the judges”. Zaid, never ceased to make oaths, thereby affirming that his right is just, and refusing to do so in front of the pulpit, which astonished Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam”. Malek said, "I don't envision anyone doing an oath before the pulpit, if the subject is less than a quarter of a dinar equivalent to three dirhams”. Chapter X What is not tolerated in the withdrawal of the deposit 
(1437) 15 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r Upon him the grace and peace of Allah said: "It is not permissible to prevent withdrawal. pledge". - Interpreting this, Malek said: “I think, and Allah knows best of this, that a man who has pledged to another something of greater value than what he has borrowed, and the pawnbroker says to the lessor: "I will return your right on such a date, otherwise you will have what I have already pledged". Now, continues Malek: “This is neither permitted nor lawful; by the way, that's what which has been prohibited even if the borrower pays what he owed after the due date, because he will always have the right to withdraw his pledge and what has been stipulated is to be cancelled”. Chapter XI The judgment made in the pledge of fruits and animals (1438) Yahia reported that he heard Malek say about someone who pledges a garden for a specific period, that he will not have to do, fruits picked from this garden, before the date of the period, an integral part of the pledge, unless the lessor the request. Likewise, if a man pawns a slave who is pregnant or will be pregnant after the date of the pledge, her newborn remains with her”. - Malek said: “We made the distinction between the fruits, and the newborn of a slave. On this subject, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “Whoever sells palm trees already fertilized, the fruits belong to the seller, unless the buyer asks to have them”. The rule, says Malek, unquestionably followed in we (in Medina), about the one who sells a slave, or a female of the animals being pregnant, the newborn comes back to the buyer whether or not he asks to have it, however the palms are not considered like animals, nor fruits like the fetus in its mother's lap". Malek interprets this as follows: "People usually pawn the fruits of the palm trees and not the palm trees themselves, but no one pawns a fetus while being in the bosom of its mother, whether it be that of a slave or a female of animals. Chapter XII The judgment concerning the deposit with animals (1439) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), regarding the pledge is the following: "If what is taken in pledge, is a land or a dwelling or an animal, which may be ravaged or destroyed or die, while being in the hands of a lessor, this responsibility rests with the pledge borrower without however the right of the lessor being diminished in any way. Thus, any pledge disappearing while being in the possession of the lessor and which can only be assessed according to the latter's statements, its compensation is the responsibility of the lessor who must pay it and who will be told : “Describe it, and make an oath”. Considering what is said, expert people will estimate the value; thus if the value of the pledge is higher than that which was fixed previously, the borrower will be able to keep the difference, but if the value is lower, one will ask the borrower to make an oath agreeing to the assertion of the statements of the lessor without him being responsible for the compensation, held for the difference between the pledge and the object given in substitution. If the borrower refuses to take the oath, the lessor will be given the difference. If the lessor, in turn, is unaware of the value of the pledge, the borrower will be asked to take an oath in which he will give the description of the pledge, recovering the difference himself if he provides obvious proof”. Malek said, "This is done, as long as the lessor keeps the pledge in his possession, without having given it to another". Chapter XII The judgment made for a pledge existing between two men (1440) Yahia reported that he heard Malek say about a pledge, which, is between two men, one of them then wants to sell it, as for the other, he had granted him for the question of this pledge, the period of one year?. Malek said: “If the pledge can be divided, without the share of the one who granted the delay being diminished, half of the pledge will be sold to secure his right. And if one risks his share being diminished, one will sell the entire pledge and give the damaged party its due. If the one who had granted the delay wants to give his half to the borrower for good, let it be done, otherwise the lessor will be asked to make an oath proving that the other had granted him a delay, only for to be able to keep the pledge as it is, and in this case we will immediately give him his right”. About the slave whose master pawns him, while the slave owns property, Malek said, "These property does not form part of the pledge unless the lessor requires it." Chapter XIV The judgment concerning pledges in general (1441) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: "As regards the person who advances in pledge personal things, which were destroyed at the lessor, but that the debtor admits this that he owes by giving the description of these things and without denying the other his right. They are in agreement except for the value of the pledge so the dispute will hold on the value, where the borrower says that it is twenty dinars, and the lessor says it is ten dinars, while the loan is twenty dinars?. Malek said, “Whoever is in possession will be told pledge; “Make his description”; if he does, he will be asked to take an oath, and therefore experts will be called in to assess the pledge in question. If the value proves to be higher than that of the real value of the pledge, the lessor will be asked to pay the borrower the difference of what he is entitled to. If the value is lower, the lessor will recover the difference from the borrower. If, in the end, the value is the same, the pledge will be compensated”. - On the other hand, in case two men quarrel the question of a pledge, so that the borrower says to the lessor: "I advanced this in pledge, for ten dinars" and that the lessor answers him: "It's more like twenty dinars", emphasizing that the pledge is in the possession of the lessor, Malek said: "We will ask the lessor to make an oath where he will specify the value of the pledge so if he shows himself that it is such without anything more or less, the lessor will take back the pledge against this value. And there, or will ask him first to make an oath because the pledge is always his property, unless the borrower does not pay the value, in order to want to take back his pledge. - If in the above situation, the value of the pledge turns out to be less than twenty dinars, the lessor will be asked to make an oath thus ensuring the sum he has fixed, and the borrower will be asked: "You will pay the sum fixed by the lessor, by making an oath and you will take back your pledge, or, you will take an oath, where you seek to ensure the fixing of the sum that you have declared, and consequently you will dispense with the difference that the lessor has designated. If the borrower makes such an oath, nothing is due to him, otherwise he will pay the sum that the lessor had already fixed". - If the pledge has disappeared, and the pledgee and the borrower both deny the right; if the one who has the right says: “I accepted this pledge by paying twenty dinars”, and the debtor answers him: “you only had ten dinars”; then the lessor, who has the right, replies: "The value of the pledge is only ten dinars", to which the borrower replies: “It was worth twenty dinars”, one will ask to that which has the right, to describe the pledge; so if he does, he will be made to take an oath, and then relying on this description, expert people will in turn estimate the value. If it turns out to be higher than that estimated by the pledger, he will be asked to make an oath, and therefore the borrower will be given the excess of the value of the pledge. If the value is lower, the pledgee will be asked to take an oath, thereby ensuring his right (of twenty dinars), and he will seek to compensate the value, the debtor will then be asked to make an oath thereby ensuring that the remainder must go to the defendant, once the value of the pledge is taken into consideration. For he who has the pledge in its possession, will become in relation to the borrower, an applicant, who taking an oath, he will owe nothing that the lessor had makes an oath about the excess value of the pledge. But, in case he refuses, he will have to pay the right of the lessor which is related to this excess”. Chapter XV Judgment on the rental of animals if they cause damage (1442) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: "When a man hires a mount to go to a well-determined place, then crosses this place to another, the owner of the mount will have to choose: "either that he claims the rental of his mount for the distance that has been covered in addition and will therefore have to collect with it the first rental by taking back his mount, or that he claims the price of his mount (in proportion to the distance covered in addition) and the first rental if this rental was made for the outward journey. If the rental includes the round trip, then the renter exceeds the middle he had previously designated, the owner of the mount would be entitled to half (of the excess) of the first rental, since this rental covers two journeys: the outward and the return . The tenant having passed the place designated, will only have to pay half of this rental. If it turns out that his mount is dead when he arrives in the designated country, the tenant will have no guarantee with regard to the owner and will only pay him the rental provided for in his half”. This is the rule followed when it is a dispute between the owner of a mount and its tenant, about the mount rented by the latter”. On the other hand, it is the same for the one who takes from the owner of a capital, a limited sum, in such a way that the latter said to him: "Do not buy yourself with this sum either an animal or a commodity", which he quotes to him, and that he forbids it to him, repugnant that his sponsorship sum be paid for such purchase. Now, if this man who had taken the money, was going to buy himself, which the owner of the capital forbids him to do so; wishing thereby to guarantee the money, and deprive the owner, of the profit, if so, this is done, the owner will have to choose: "or to share with the other the profit of the goods according to the condition advanced by them on this subject, by entrusting him with the money or even to have his capital back being guaranteed by the other, and of what moreover he had abused it". It is the same for the case of a man who asks another to buy from him a commodity which will be added to his own by paying him a sum, so that he can buy from him a commodity that he designates for him. In the event that the other buys a commodity which is not that which has been designated for him, by abusing this trust, the owner of the sum will have to choose: "either that he takes the commodity which the other bought it for him, or that he takes back his money once the second guarantees it to him". Chapter XVI The judgment relating to the woman raped by force 
(1443) 16 - Ibn Chehab reported that Abdul Malek Ibn Marwan ruled that the man who raped a woman by force, must pay her the dowry”. - Malek said: “Regarding the man who violates a woman by force, whether she be a virgin or married, he will have to pay her her dowry if she is free, and a sum equivalent to her price, which has become devaluative, if she is a slave. As for the prescribed penalty, it is to be applied to the violator alone, independently of the one who was violated who is not responsible for it. On the other hand, if the violator is a slave, it is his master who will be responsible for it, unless he agrees to hand him over”. Chapter XVII Of the Judgment concerning the use of an animal and the consumption of food and other (...) - I heard, reported Yahia, Malek say: "What is followed with us (in Medina), concerning the one who has consumed an animal without having had the permission of its owner, is that he will have to pay to the latter, the estimated price of this animal on day, even when he consumed it, without his giving in compensation for this animal, another which is similar to it. The sum, in this regard, is considered the fairest compensation, whether it is an animal or of a commodity. - Malek also said: “About the one who has consumed a food without having had the permission of its owner, it must in compensation give back to this owner the same food and of the same weight or measure, for the good reason that food is considered as gold and silver, where silver is compensated by silver and gold by gold . On the other hand the animal is not taken in the same way as gold; and in this respect it is by the sunnah that the distinction has been made”. - Malek finally said, “If a man deposits at another a sum of money, with which the second will go to trade and acquired a profit, this profit belongs to him alone, from the moment he has guaranteed money until he return to its owner. Chapter XVIII Of the judgment made about the apostate 
(1444) 17 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever changes his religion, strike his neck" . Interpreting this hadith, Malek said, "What we think, and Allah is the most informed, about the one who changes his religion, he must be killed who denies Islam and converts to a another religion such as atheists and their ilk, and who declare, they are killed, because it is not known whether they have repented, but if they keep their atheism in disbelief, and declare to be Muslims, they must neither be allowed to repent nor accept their words. On the other hand, the one who leaves Islam, to adopt another religion, while declaring it, we will accept for this one his repentance, if he puts it in proof, otherwise we kill him. Because, for people who find themselves in such a situation, I think that we must convert them to Islam and that they repent. So if they show repentance, we will accept it, if not, we will kill them. And said Malek, I do not believe, that the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) designated by this, the Jews who became Christians or the Christians who became Jews, nor those who left their religion for another, except that it is about Islam, because the one who leaves it to adopt another religion while declaring, this is the man whom the Prophet (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) wanted to designate and Allah is most informed about this. 
(1445) 18 - Abdul Kari reported that a man came from Abu Moussa Al-Ach'ari, find Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, who questioned him about people, to which the man replied. Then Omar said to him, "Have you heard from those who are in the distant regions"? The man replied: “Certainly a man apostatized after being a Muslim". Omar resumed: "What have you done with him"? The man to answer: “We brought him in and we cut his head off” ; Omar exclaimed: "Did you not put him in prison for three days, giving him a piece of bread to eat every day, in order to give him the possibility of returning to Allah, repenting and converting again to Islam”? Then Umar added: “Great Allah! I was not present at this murder, and I would not have ordered it, nor accepted it, if I had been informed of this event”. Chapter XIX The judgment made about one who finds his wife with a man 
(1446) 19 - Abu Huraira reported that Sa'd Ibn Oubada, finding the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: "What do you think, if I find a man with my wife; should i leave it so i can call four witnesses”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: “yes”. 
(1447) 20 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported that a a man from Syria, named Ibn Khaibari, having found a man with his wife, killed him, or killed them together. Reporting this case to Mouawia Ibn Abi Soufian, so that he can judge on it; Mouawia falling into the embarrassment, wrote to Abou Moussa al-Ach'ari, asking him to have the opinion of Ali Ibn Abi taleb, on this subject. Ali -replied, “This event did not take place in my country; I ask you to tell it to me; Abou Moussa wrote to Mouawia Ibn Abi Soufian, following which Ali gave his proposal saying: “I, the undersigned; me Abou Al Hassan if he does not call four witnesses, that he must pay the price of the blood of the victim”. Chapter XX The foundling judgment 
(1448) 21 - Ibn Chehab reported that Sunain Ibn Jamila, a man from Bani Soulaim, found, in the time of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, an abandoned child. Sounain continues: “So I took him to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab who asked me: “What made you take charge of this little soul”? Sounain answered: "I found it, neglected, so I took care of it". One of Omar's advisers said: “O prince of the believers, he is a virtuous man”, Umar on his part replied: “Do you find him as such”? Yes, replied the adviser; thus Omar Ibn Al Khattab declared: “Leave therefore, he is free, and you have the right to patronize him, as for us, we will take care of his expenses". Malek said, “What is followed in Medina is to consider the abandoned child, free, and to the Muslims to patronize him, while inheriting him and paying for him, the price of blood”. Chapter XXI The judgment concerning the adoption of the child to his father 
(1449) 22 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported: "Utba Ibn Abi Waqas had entrusted to his brother Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas, a child, saying to him: "The son of the slave of Zam'a is mine, take charge of him”. Aisha continues: "When it was the year of the conquest, Sa'd took the child saying: 'He is the son of my brother (nephew) and it was his father who entrusted him to me.' Abd Ibn Zam'a protested and said, "He is rather my brother, and the son of my father's slave, born on his bed." Bringing their accusation to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) Sa'd said: "O Messenger of Allah, he is the son of my brother, who entrusted him to me", and Abd Ibn Zam'a, on his part , says: “He is my brother, and is the son of my father's slave, born on his bed”; the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's favor and peace) said, "He is your brother, Abd Ibn Zam'a”, then added: “The child returns to the master of the bed, on the other hand adultery, must be stoned”. Finally addressing Sawda Bint Zam'a, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "You have to veil yourself, in his presence", seeing the resemblance of the child in question to Utba Ibn Abi Waqas. And this child never saw Sawda, until his death”. ; 
(1450) 23 - Abdallah Ibn Abi Oumaya reported that a woman, having lost her husband, passed a widowhood of four months and ten days, then this period having elapsed, she married a man with whom she remained for four and a half months, and gave birth , a child after a nine-month pregnancy. Her husband went to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab to whom he told this; Omar then summoned elderly women, who had witnessed such a situation in pre-Islamic times, and asked them to inform him about it. Moon of them said: “I can tell you about this woman; her husband died while she was pregnant, then she had a discharge of blood, but her child remained stable in her bosom. As soon as her second husband has had intercourse with her, the child, having tasted the sperm, is revived and grows bigger”. Omar considering what was advanced by this woman, separated between the woman subject discussed and her husband, saying: "I have been told about you (addressing the group of women) nothing but good, and then attached the child to the first husband". 
(1451) 24 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab linked children born in pre-Islamic times to those who claimed to be their fathers in early Islamic times. Two men came, each claiming in turn to be the father of a a son born to a woman. So Omar Ibn Al-Khattab summoned a physiognomist who was going to examine them both and then said: "This child is both at the same time” Omar, gave him a whiplash and then summoned the woman saying to him: “Tell me the truth”. So the woman said: "One of these two men - and she pointed to one - was going to my house, when I was at that time tending the camels to pasture, he did not part with me unless he was sure and me too, that I had become pregnant. The leaving, she had a discharge of blood, after which the second man had cohabited her, thus, she does not know of this fact which of the two is the father”, the physiognomist, listening, exalted Allah, as for Omar, addressing the child, said to him: "It's up to you to choose, which of the two will be your boss ". 
(1452) 25 - It was reported to Malek, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab or Osman Ibn Affan, had judged the case of a slave, who invited a man to adultery, telling him that she was free, he married her and bore her several children: "Let a man ransom his children with what is equivalent". Malek on this, said: "And to ransom them at the value of their price is more just, in this case, Allah willing." Chapter XXII The judgment relating to the subject of the child's inheritance recognized (1453) -Malek said: - What we follow at home (in Medina), is this which follows: “when a man dies, and one of his many sons says: “My father has recognized such, to be his son”; this kinship is not never taken into consideration, based on the testimony of a single person. On the other hand, whoever makes such a recognition, will have to give from his share received from the paternal inheritance, a share similar to that which he recognized to be son of his father”. • Interpreting this, Malek said, "Consider that a man dies leaving two sons, and a sum of six hundred dinars, where each will have three hundred dinars for his share. One of them, testifying that his father had declared to him, before his death, that so and so is his son, he will have to give on his part, one hundred dinars to the son in question. Such a sum constitutes half of the recognized child's share; on the other hand if the other brother had made the same testimony, the child should still have a hundred dinars, thus receiving his full share of the inheritance, and consequently his relationship would be evident (let us emphasize that, the inheritance being thus divided, each will have had his fair share, namely two hundred dinars). Her case is similar to that of a woman who confesses that her father or husband owes a debt, and the other heirs deny it; thus, she will have to pay this debt to the creditor, in proportion to what she will receive as part of the inheritance, if it is done that the debt will revert to all the heirs: for example, if she inherits one-eighth of the inheritance as a wife, she must pay one-eighth of the debt to the creditor; and if she inherits half as an only child, she will pay half the debt. This is the standard that should be applied to women acknowledging debt”. If again, a man admits in the same way, to the woman, that his father owed any debt, the creditor is inclined to make an oath with his witness, and will thereby have all the debt. However, this case is not taken in the same way as that of the woman, as long as the testimony of the man is tolerated; thus the latter having recognized the debt, the creditor is asked to make an oath with his witness, and will therefore have all his rights. If the creditor reuses to take this oath, he will have of the inheritance of the one who recognized the debt to him, a part which is proportional, to the part returning to the successor of the inheritance; as for the others, they would have denied this debt”. Chapter XXIII The Judgment Made About Child-Slave Mothers 
(1454) 26 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported from his father that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “What happens to men, who after having cohabited with their slaves, they leave them? Every slave who came to tell me that her master had cohabited her, I would only attribute the child to her master, whether or not he practiced coitus interruptus with her. 
(1455) 27 - Safia Bint Abi Oubaid reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “For what reason, men cohabit their slaves, then leave them. Any slave who came to confide in me, that her master had sex with a slave, I would adopt the child. So either you have to give them up or keep them”. - Malek said: “About the slave-mother of a child, in case she commits a crime, it is the rule followed here (in Medina), that her master pays the price within the limits of its value without him delivering it. And, consequently, he will not have to burden himself with any value other than that which his price merits. Chapter XXIV The judgment made about wasteland belonging to no one 
(1456) 28 - Urwa reported from his father that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Whoever does the reviving a dead earth, it will be his property. On the other hand, whoever appropriates land unjustly, by planting it, this land will never be his possession”. - Interpreting this hadith, Malek said: “we mean by unequal appropriation, any land which has been either cultivated or planted, without any right”. 
(1457) 29 - Abdullah reported that his father Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “He who revives a dead land, it will be his possession”. Malek said, "This is what was followed at home (in Medina)." Chapter XXV The judgment made about the water 
(1458) 30 - It was reported to Abdullah Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “About the irrigation canals of “Mahzouz and Mouzaineb” two valleys in Medina: “Whoever owns the part upper part of these two valleys, retains the water at the level of its land (thus watering its land) then when it reaches the level of the ankles it sends it back to water the lower part". 1459). which abounds with water, because in this way we will prevent the grasses, serving as pasture, from growing".

(1463) 35 - Al-Mazini reported from his father that Al-Dahaq Ibn Khalifa had dug from “Al-Ouraid” - valley in Medina - an irrigation canal, which he wanted to cross in a piece of land which belonged to Muhammad Ibn Maslama. The latter refusing it, Al-Dahaq said to him: “Why do you refuse it to me, and yet you are going to take advantage of it? you will be able to have water to drink forever, and it will not harm you”. Muhammad still refusing it, al-Dahaq informs Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, who summoned Muhammad Ibn Maslama, and ordered him to allow Al-Dahaq. But Muhammad still not accepting, Omar exclaimed: "Why do you prevent your brother from doing what is useful, and which is still so for you: you will water your land forever with this water, and that will in no way harm you". Muhammad's answer being: "No, by Allah", Umar exclaimed: "By Allah, he will make this channel pass, even on your belly", and then ordered, to Al-Dahaq to dig it, the latter did it”. 
(1464) 36 - Yahia Al-Mazini reported that his father said: “There was in the garden of his grandfather, a rivulet which belonged to Abdul-Rahman Ibn Awf.

Chapter XXVII The judgment made on the distribution of property 
(1465) 37 Thawr Ibn Zaid Al-Dili said: “I have been told that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “Any abode or land that was divided in pre-Islamic times, it will be maintained as it was divided. And any abode or land that is to be shared in Islamic times, will be shared according to Islamic law”. 
(1466) 38 - Malek said: "He who dies, leaving property, being in "Al-Alia" and "Al-Safila" (places in Medina), the non-irrigated territory will not be shared with that which is irrigated, with water that is brought to it; unless the heirs of the deceased accept it. A non-irrigated land is to be shared with another watered by water from a spring, if both are the same. At where the property is in one place, or close to each other, each party will be valued alone, then the division will be made between the successors. It is the same with houses and dwellings. Chapter XXVIII Judgment Regarding Carnivorous Beasts and Kept Herds 
(1467) 39 - Haram Ibn Sa'd Ibn Muhaiissa reported that a camel possessed by al-Bara Ibn Azeb had entered a garden and caused damage. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) requires that the owners of the garden keeps it during the day; as for the damage caused by the camel during the night, it is up to its owner to compensate for it”. 
(1468) 40 • Yahia Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Hateb a reported that some of his slaves stole a camel from a man of Mouzaina and cut her throat. The case was presented to Omar, who ordered Kathir Ibn Al-Salt to cut off their hands. But immediately Omar grabbed hold of him and said to Hateb: “Don't you give them enough to eat? By Allah, continued Omar, I will make you pay an unbearable fine”, then addressing the man: “What is the price of your camel”? Al-Muzani replied, "By Allah, I will not sell it for less than four hundred dirhams." So Umar said to Hateb, "Give him eight hundred dirhams." - Malek said: "You must not believe that you sought in Medina, to double the value; but that's what people usually followed; now, however, the value of the fine is equal to that of the price of the camel or the animal on the day it was taken”. Chapter XXIX Judgment Made About One Who Causes Harm to Beasts (1469) - Malek said: "What is followed in us (in Medina), in case someone has caused harm to a beast, it is that he will pay a price, compensate for the one who was going to be subtracted from the real price of the animal which has thus lost its value". - In case a camel throws itself on a man of frightened, kills or mutilates him, Malek said: "If this man were fully sure of the danger, nothing comes back to him. pay as compensation; on the other hand, if your only argument is what is said by him, he must indemnify the owner of this camel". Chapter XXX The ruling on workers' wages (1470) - Malek said: “He who gives his garment to the launderer to change his color, after which he comes to say to the latter: I did not order you to do it, and that the other answers him: in fact, it is you who ordered me to do it do", one must in this case, admit what is the words of the laundress, and it is the same, when it is a question of a dressmaker and a jeweler where they are brought to make an oath to this topic, unless they were going to do something else what they were asked to do; thus, they will no longer be able to be believed and the one who possesses the garment will be asked to make an oath. If he refuses to do so, the dyer is asked to do so. - Malek also said: "If the dyer, to whom one has given the garment, is mistaken in knowing that he gives it to another man who is not its possessor and that he puts it on, nothing is demanded of this man but it is up to the dyer to pay an indemnity to the teacher of the garment, since the person who put on the garment was unaware that it was not his; on the other hand, if he knew that this garment was not his, he must guarantee it”. ChapterXXXI The judgment made about the guarantor and the person who assumes a claim (1471) - Malek said, "In case a man having a debt, causes it to be borne by another who is a creditor to him; if the latter goes bankrupt or dies without having paid the debt, we demands nothing from the debtor and the creditor has no right to go back on him to recover his debt. Such is the indisputable rule followed with us in Medina. – Malek also said, “When a man takes charge a debt which he will pay for another and whether he dies or goes bankrupt, the creditor has the right to come back to the debtor to settle his debt”. Chapter X XXII The judgment made about someone who buys a garment with a defect (1472) - Malek said: “Whoever buys a garment having a defect such as a burn or other, that the seller knows and has confirmed, and that the one who bought it, tore it, in such a way that this tear reduced the price of the garment, after which the buyer has noticed the original defect, the garment can be returned to the seller, without the buyer having to pay anything for having torn this garment”. – Malek also said: “If a man buys a garment having a defect such as a burn or a hole, which he seeks to cut out or dye, and the seller says he was unaware that the garment was so, the buyer can choose between having or keeping the garment after the seller has agreed to reduce his price because of the defect, or to return the garment to the seller by paying him the indemnity for cutting or dyeing. However, if the buyer has had the garment dyed in such a way that it has become more expensive, he will still have to choose: or ask the seller for a price compensating the defect of the garment, or to be a partner of the seller for the question of the garment. Then, we estimate the garment included the burn or hole; so if the price is ten dirhams, and the dyeing of the garment is five, the seller and the buyer are both partners in the garment, where each will have a share which will be proportional either to the initial price of the garment or to the costs paid for the dyeing”. Chapter XXXIII What is not permitted when giving gifts 
(1473) 41 - Al-Nou'man Ibn Bashir reported that his father brought him to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) to whom he said: "I have done to my son, the gift of a slave I owned. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) replied: "Did you give the same gift for all your sons”? No, replied the other, so the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said, "So take back this slave." 
(1474) 42 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported that his father Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq had given him a gift of twenty wasqs of dates, being his property in "Al-Ghaba". When he died he said: “By Allah, my daughter, I would not like to see after me, someone richer than you, and it is unbearable to me that you are poorer than the others, so I gave you a gift of twenty wasqs of dates, which if you had picked them personally, they would would be a donation; but now, being considered an inheritance, you will have to share them with your two brothers and sisters, according to what is prescribed in the Book of Allah”. Aisha asked him, “Father, if it were so, by Allah, I would have abandoned him. However, I don't have only Asma for sister, who is the other”? He replied: "It is the daughter that Bint Kharija (the wife of the brother of Abu Bakr of the Ansars) carries in his lap, and I consider her as such (he implies that this girl will be Aicha's sister). 
(1475) 43 - Abdul Rahman Ibn abdul Qari reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said, “What happens to men giving gifts to their sons and then retaining those gifts with them. So if one of them has a son who dies, he says: "My goods are always within my reach, I have not given them to anyone". But as soon as he feels death approaching he says: "This is a gift I gave to my son". "Now, whoever decides to make a donation, and does not advance it to the person to whom he intended it, preferring to keep it as an inheritance to his successors, this donation becomes illicit". Chapter XXXIV Of what is forbidden as a gift (1476) - Malek said: "What one follows in we, (in Medina), about the one who gives a gift to someone, not aiming to have another in exchange, doing it also in the presence of witnesses, that this gift, is already assured to the person destined, except in case the one who made the gift dies, before he actually gave it to the other. On the other hand, if the donor wants to retain his gift, after he has made a testimony about it, this is forbidden to him; thus, if the one to whom belongs the gift, claims it, he must have it”. - Malek also said: "Whoever gives a certain gift, after which he denies it, then that whoever was to take advantage of this gift, bring a witness, assuring him that the other had indeed given him a gift, namely whether it be a commodity, gold, silver or an animal, one will bring the one who was to benefit and his witness to make an oath about it. If they refuse it, the donor will be asked to do so, if this one still refuses it, he will give to the other what he claims, by right, to have, especially if he has only one witness; if the latter is not present, the donor will have nothing to advance”. - Malek finally said, “Whoever donates, without wanting to have something in return, and that the beneficiary dies, the heirs of the latter, will benefit from this gift; and if the beneficiary dies before having had his gift, he will have nothing in this case, because the gift was not yet in his possession. Thus, if the donor wants to keep it, having had a witness about his donation, proving that he had made it, the beneficiary will be able to have it, if he asks for it”. Chapter XXXV Judgment Made About Donations 
(1477) 44 - Abu Ghatfan Ibn Tarif Al Mourri a reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said, “Whoever gives a gift, or even alms, to a close relative, should no longer withhold it. And whoever makes a gift, wanting thereby to obtain another in exchange, can keep his gift, even go back on this gift, if he is not satisfied with what he should have in exchange”. - Malek said: “What is followed at home (at Medina) about the receipt of a gift, which undergoes a transformation of more or less, that the donee wishing to make an exchange, will have to consider the value of this gift just at its delivery”. Chapter XXXVI The taking back of alms (1478) - Malek said: "What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), when a person who has given his son an alms which he has already taken, or who has remained in the custody of his father, and who has testified about this alms, the father will no longer have the right to withhold this alms, either partially or totally. - Malek said again: "He who gives a gift who is not an alms to his son, , has the right to withhold this gift as long as the son has not used this gift to take on a debt from people so that he becomes a debtor; thus, in this case there the father will not be able to retain this gift to leave his son unable to discharge his debt. Therefore, the father has no right to withhold his gift in the following cases: Whether the father gives his son, or his daughter in marriage, so that the girl marries the man or the man marries the girl only to be rich and for the money that her father had given her. Or that the man marries the woman to whom his father had donated, thereby assuring him of a large dowry due to his wealth and possessions, and to what his father had given him". Chapter XXXVII The judgment made about the "Umrah" NB The "Oumra": it is about the fact that someone says to another: "I will give you this home where you can stay as long as you are alive". On the death of the person who disposes of this residence, the residence must return to its owner if he is still desire; otherwise the heirs of the one who lived in the house will be able to benefit from it”. 
(1479) 45 Jaber Ibn Abdallah Al-Ansari reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam)r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Everyone, receiving what is of the “Umrah”, as well as its heirs, it will be his possession, without ever returning to the donor”; also this property will be subject to the laws of inheritance”. 
(1480) 46 - Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported that he heard Makhoul Al-Dimashki ask Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad about the "Umrah", and what people say about it"? Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad replied, "People never cease to bind themselves to their time-honored promises, about their possessions and what they receive." - Malek said: "What we follow at home (in Medina) concerning the Umrah is that it must return to its owner on the death of the donee unless he said to the latter: "It belongs to you and to your heirs". 
(1481) 47 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar had inherited Hafsa Bint Omar, his home. However, the latter, had lodged in this residence, the daughter of Zaid Ibn Al-Khattab, as long as she was alive; but when she died, the residence returned to Abdallah Ibn Omar, which he considered to be his”. Chapter XXXVffl Judgment about what is found 
(1482) 48 - Zaid Ibn Khaled Al-Jouhani reported that a man came to find the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) asking him about what is found”. He replied: "Study well, the shape of the object found, then make an announcement about him for a year; if its owner comes to claim it, it will be his right, if not, it will come back to you”. The man asked again, "O Messenger of Allah (Upon him be Allah's mercy and peace), what do you say about the lost sheep?" He answered: "It will be either yours or your brother's or the wolf"; the other added, "What about the stray camel?" The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) replied, “Do not worry about him; for the camel has its water to drink, and its hooves (to move about); it will therefore be able to drink, eat the leaves of the trees to eat, until its owner finds it”. 
(1483) 49 Mu'awia Ibn Abdallah Ibn Badr Al-Jouhani reported that his father told him, that on the way to Châm (the Syria), he stopped with people and found a purse containing eighty dinars. Telling it to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, he said to him: "Announcement ; this find in mosques, and to anyone who arrives from Châm (Damascus), for a year; if this time has already elapsed, it will come back to you”. 
(1484) 50 - Nafe' reported that a man having found a lost object, went to Abdallah Ibn Omar and said to him: "What do you say about a lost object that I found"? Abdallah Ibn Omar said to him: "Announce this object". Answering him that he had already done it, Abdallah asked him to do it again; So, after having announced it several times, Abdallah said to him, “I will not order you to consume it; because if you wanted to, you would not have taken this object”. Chapter XXXIX The judgment made about the consumption of a slave for a found object (1485) Malek said: “What is followed with us (at Medina), about the slave, who, finds an object, consumes it, before a year has elapsed from the very day on which he had found this object, that he will assume the responsibility for it, namely: "Or that the master of this slave will pay to the owner of this object, a price thereby compensating for what his slave had consumed, or that he will deliver his slave to him”. But if the slave had kept the object found for the period provided for, namely, one year, after which he consumed it, this object will be for him a debt which the slave will have to discharge; Therefore if he happens to be freed, nothing will be demanded of him or his master regarding this object”. Chapter XL The judgment made about stray animals 
(1486) 51 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that Thabet Ibn Al-Dahhaq Al-Ansari told him that he found a stray camel in "Al-Harra", he restrained it and then reported it to Umar Ibn Al-Khattab who ordered him to announce about the camel, three times. Now Thabet said to him: "This camel made me neglect my properties", Omar said to him: "Leave it where you found it". 
(1487) 52 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaisab reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab, while leaning his back against the wall of the Ka'ba, said: "He who guards a stray animal, has already committed a sin." 
(1488) 53 - Malek reported that he heard Ibn Shehab say: "The lost animals were, in the time of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, considered as belonging to their owner, and of the In fact, they copulated without anyone thinking of holding them back. But, when it was time for Osman Ibn Affan, he ordered to advertise about them and then sell them; thus, if their owner presented himself, he was paid their selling price”. Chapter XLI Alms given from the living for the dead 
(1489) 54 - Sa'id Ibn Amr Ibn's grandfather Churhabil Ibn Sa'id Ibn Sa'd Ibn Ubada reported: "Sa'd Ibn Ubada, went with the Messenger of Allah r (On him the grace and peace of Allah) for an expedition, and his mother was about to die in Medina, he was told: "Make your will". She replied, “Why make this will; all the property I own goes to Sa'd”; then she died, before Sa'd was present in Medina, he was told what had happened, Sa'd said to the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's favor and peace): "O Messenger of Allah, will she be rewarded if I do alms in his name”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) replied: “Yes, certainly”. Then Sa'd said: "Such a garden, (which he pointed to), is alms." 
(1490) 55 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported that a man came and said to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): “O Messenger of Allah my mother died suddenly, and I believe that she wanted to tell me to give alms for her; can I do it”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: “Yes, certainly”. 
(1491) 56 - It was reported to Malek that a man of the Ansars, from the tribe of Al-Hareth Ibn Al-Khazraj, made his parents, an alms. His parents having died, the son inherited all their property which was palm groves. So he asked about it the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who replied: “You gave alms to your parents, and you have already had a reward; as for the inheritance, it is your acquisition”. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 37 The Book of the Testament First chapter The order to make a will 
(1492) 1 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “It is required of all Muslim, who has property to bequeath, not even to spend two nights without having written down his will". - Malek said: “What is followed at home (at Medina), about the one who, is healthy or sick, and who has already made his will in which he freed a slave or ordered something else, that he can, if he wants, change what is will, until his death. He can even neglect this will and proceed to write another, except the posthumous freeing of a slave, because there, he will not be able to change anything. This is in accordance with what the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "It is the duty of every Muslim, who, having property to bequeath, not even to spend two nights, without having written down his will". - Malek continues: “So if it is done that the testator can no longer either have his will modified, nor change its contents concerning postage, he will have withheld his money which he tended to spend for postage and for other action. The testator must make his will when he is traveling and when he is healthy”. Eventually Malek said, "Thus, what is an indisputable rule is that the testator can therefore change his will as long as he wishes, without this change affecting the subject of posthumous emancipation". Chapter II Permission for the younger, the sick, the weak and the foolish to make their will 
(1493) 2 - Abu Bakr Ibn Hazm reported from his father that Amr Ibn Soulaim Al-Zouraqui told him that Omar Ibn was told Al-Khatiab, about a young man who has not yet reached puberty, of the Ghassan tribe, owner of a fortune whose only heiress in Medina is a paternal cousin, as for the other heirs, they are found in Cham (in Syria). Umar Ibn Al-Khattab replied, "Let him make a will to his cousin." The young man, thus, bequeathed him a piece of land called: "Bir Joucham" which was sold for thirty thousand dirhams. This cousin who received this bequest was Oum Amr Ibn Sulaim al-Zouraqi”. 
(1494) 3 - Abu Bakr Ibn Hazm reported that a young boy from the Ghassan tribe, was dying, while he was in Medina, and that his heir was in Cham. We informed Omar Ibn Al-Khattab of this, and we asked him if this young man could make his will, he replied in the affirmative. Abu Bakr added: "The young boy, in question was ten or twelve years old, and had bequeathed a piece of land called "Bir Joucham", later sold by the heir for thirty thousand dirhams". - Malek said: “What is followed at home (at Medina), about one who has a weak mind, and one who is foolish, and also, one who sometimes loses the consciousness, that their will is to be considered, if they prove to be, if necessary , reasonable. However, if they fail to be so, that is, they fail in reason, they cannot make their will”. Chapter III The bequest that does not exceed one third of the inheritance 
(1495) 4 - Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqs narrated: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) having come to visit me, during of the farewell pilgrimage, when I was seriously ill, I said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, the disease attacked me from all sides; but I have a good fortune and I have only one heiress daughter, can I donate two-thirds of my wealth”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) replied, "No"; So I asked him: "and half"? “No, replied the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), but the third, and even the third is already too much; That you leave your heirs rich is better than leaving them poor, holding out their hands to people. For all your expenses on your family seeking by it the love of Allah, you are rewarded, even for the mouthful you put in your wife's mouth". I said to him: “O Messenger of Allah will I remain in Makkah, then that my companions are no longer there”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: "You will not be vainly a latecomer, for every good work you do will raise you in rank and consideration. You may be retarded, but on the one hand you will be useful to some and a detriment to others. O Great Allah! Make my companions complete their emigration and do not turn them back. But the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was saddened, a little later, that the unfortunate Sa'd Ibn Khawla died in Mecca”. - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: "when a man bequeaths a third of his property to another, saying: "my slave will serve such a man as long as he is alive", after which he will be freed, and that following the death of the testator, the 'we note that the value of the slave constitutes a third of his goods, one must, in this case, make esteem for the service rendered by the slave, and thus, the two men will have their share, just as follows: one gives to the first what is proportional to the third of the goods, and to the other what belongs to him of the service of the slave after evaluation; therefore each of them will have his share of the value of the slave's service or wages if he has done the work of his employee, in proportion to what he is entitled to do. But if the man in whose service the slave had worked dies, he must be freed”. - Malek also said: “He who bequeaths a third of his inheritance, saying: "One part to such, another to such", quoting his goods, and that his heirs find that the legacy is more than a third”, these heirs will have to choose: or that they give to the designated characters their part of the goods which return to them, by having with them all the heritage of the deceased; or that they give to the designated persons a third of the property of the deceased, and will subsequently have their shares, of whatever value they may be”. Chapter IV The bequests given by a pregnant woman, a sick person and a man fighting in the way of Allah (1496) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: "The best I have heard about the will made by a pregnant woman, and concerning her property, what is allowed to her is that she is considered just as a sick person, who in case, where his illness is not serious, namely that it is not tragic, he can dispose of his property as he wishes; on the other hand, if the illness is tragic, the patient will only be able to bequeath a third of his inheritance”. And, continues Malek, such is the case of a woman pregnant: her pregnancy is a welcome and a joy, where she is neither sick nor risky, which is also said by Allah (Blessed and Very high): َ ق يَ ْع ُ ق وب { ْس َح َ و َ ر اء إ َ ق َ و ِ م ن ْس َح َش ْ ر ن َ ا ه ا ب ِ إ ْت َ ف ب َض ِح َ ك َ م ٌة َ ف َ ق آئ } َ و ام َ ر أ ُت ُ ه "We announced to him the good news (of Isaac, and Yacoub, after Isaac" (Koran XI, 71) and: َ ه ا { إ ِ ل ْ ي َ م ا َ ف ل ْت بِ ِ ه َ ف َ م َ ر َخ ِ ف يفا َح ْ م ا َح َ م ل ْت َ ش اها َ م ا ت َغ َ ف ل َ ص ال ِ ح ا ْ ن آت ْ ي َت َ ن ا َ م ا ل َ ئ َ ر ب ُ ه ّ َ ه َد َع َ و ا َ ق ل َ ت أ ْث ِ م َ ن الشاك ِ ر ين ُ ك و ن َ ن } ل َ ن “She carried a light burden with which she walked easily. When it grew heavy, both called on Allah, their Lord: If You give us a just man, we will surely be grateful” (Koran VII, 189). Thus, once the woman's pregnancy is at sixth month, the woman will be able to dispose of a third of her property; because it is the completion of the six months, where Allah Blessed and Most High said: { ِ ن َ ك امل ْ ي َح ْ و ل ْ ي ِ ن ُ ه َ ن َ ن أ ْ و ا َد ِض ْع ُ ي ْر َ د ات } َ و ال َ و ال “Mothers who want to give breastfeeding their children, will breastfeed them for two whole years” (Koran II, 33), and: ُش َد ُ ه { َ غ أ َح َ ت ى إِ َ ذ ا بَ ل َش ْ ه ً ر ا ُ ه ثَ َا ُ ث ون َ ص ال } َ و ف “From the moment she got it designed, up to the time of his sevarge, thirty months have passed" (Koran XLVI, 15). Thus, if, from the day the woman became pregnant, six months have passed, she will only be able to dispose of a third of her property”. - Malek finally said: “The man who participates in a fight, he will therefore be able to bequeath only a third of his property, thus he is considered, under the same conditions, as a pregnant woman, and a seriously ill man”. Chapter V A Reservee's Bequest, and the Right of Possession (1497) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say about this verse: ِ ق ين { ُ م َت َ ع ل َ ى ال َح ً ق ا َ م ْع ُ ر وف َ و اأق َ ر ب ِ ي ن ب ِ ا ل َد ْ ي ِ ن ُة ل ْ ل َ و ال ِ ص ي َخ ْ ي ً ر ا ال َ و } إ ِ ن ت َ ر َ ك “If this (the deceased) leaves property, he must make a will in favor of his father and mother. (Qur'an, II, 180), that it has been abrogated by other verses relating to the distribution of inheritance according to what is prescribed in the Glorified Book of Allah. - Malek also said: “He is from the sunnah unquestionably followed in our country (in Medina), not to tolerate making a bequest to an heir, unless the heirs give this right to the deceased. In case some of the heirs allow it and others refuse it, the heir to whom it is decided to make a bequest will receive this exceptional share of the first part, while the others will have their full share. - About the patient who can only have the third of his property, his heirs are asked for a permit to make a bequest to an heir, exceeding one third, Malek said, "Once this permit is granted, the heirs will no longer have the right to return to it , because, if it were allowed to them, any heir at the death of the testator, would have acted similarly, namely, that he will have the inheritance without putting the legacy into execution, including the third party and what the testator had bequeathed according to the permit granted to him". As for the testator, who in good health, asks to his heirs the permission to make a bequest, and that the latter grant it to him, Malek said: "They are not bound to accept it, and these heirs even have the right to refuse it, because, the man in question , being in good health, he has more than anyone else the right to enjoy his goods, namely to make alms at all, or to give them to anyone. On the other hand, if the man falls ill, thus no longer being able to dispose of his property, the heirs' permit becomes payable as long as he can only dispose of a third of his property, as for them, they will only have two third of which they have more right than him. Consequently, if one of the heirs comes to ask the dying man, to give him the inheritance, and that this one accepts it without putting it into execution, this gift must return to the one who must benefit from it, except if the man leaving the inheritance does not say: "Such of the heirs is weak, and I like that you give him your share and that he accepted, this is tolerated if the sick man had precisely mentioned the thing». - Malek further said, "If he gives her the inheritance, and that the beneficiary has executed a part, while another remains, this part must revert to the donor after the death of the heir”. - Eventually Malek said, “About the one who, in his will, mentions having given to one of his heirs, something which he had not obtained, and as a result, these heirs refuse to tolerate him, this legacy must return to them, according to what is prescribed in the Book of Allah, because the deceased did not want this legacy to be part of his third party. And we never give to legatees what is a third of their inheritance”. Chapter VI The subject of effeminate men and the one who has the most right to a child (1498) 5" Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported from his father that an effeminate, present at Oum Salama, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), said to Abdallah Ibn Abi Oumaya, and the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), was at his listen: “O Abdallah! if Allah will grant you tomorrow, the conquest of Taif, I will guide you to the daughter of Ghailan, who has four folds in front, and moving away, she shows eight”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) then said: “Do not let such a man into your house”. (....) 6 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad say: “A woman from the Ansar, was married to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, she bore Assem to him, and after that he divorced her. Arriving in Qouba, he found his son Assem playing in the courtyard of the mosque; so he took him by his arm and placed him before him on his mount. Immediately the child's grandmother stopped him and took the child away from him. Then both went to Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq where Omar exclaimed, "he is my son", and the woman from him said, "he is mine". Then Abu Bakr, addressing Omar, said to him: “Do not come between the mother and her child”; and Omar did not repeat his request. - Malek on this subject says: “This is what I want to follow”. Chapter VII The defect of a product and its guarantee (1499) - About the man who buys a merchandise, an animal, or a garment or any other merchandise, and he finds that sale is not approved, so that he decides to return what he bought, Malek said: " The owner of the merchandise only receives from its price the sum which was paid to him on the day he sold it, because the seller had guaranteed the merchandise on the day the sale was decided; thus any defect or lack, found in the goods, after the date of the sale, returns to the purchaser, given that his usufruct or the increase in the price returns to him. Also, it is possible that the buyer buys a commodity at a time when it is demanded and consumed, then he decides to return it when it is no longer fit to be sold. For example, a man buys goods for ten dinars, keeps it, then wants to return it, when its price is only one dinar; this he is not allowed as long as he causes the seller the loss of nine dinars; so either he resells it at this price or keeps it. On the other hand, if the buyer was going to return the goods, the very day of his purchase, he should have taken back the ten dinars he had paid, and no longer the price he must have had on the day he decided to return it, which had become, moreover, one dinar, causing the seller to lose nine dinars”. What justifies this, says Malek, is the following: “When a thief steals an object; the price of this object is estimated on the day the theft was committed, so that it is decided to cut off his hand, even if the decision is delayed, and the thief is in prison. If the thief had fled, and then was, after a certain time, arrested, and if, on the other hand, the value of the object had been reduced in such a way that the prescribed penalty can no longer be applied, this fall in price, is not to be considered. Nor is it considered that the offense is not subject to the penalty prescribed on the day of the theft, and that the price has increased when the thief was imprisoned and therefore the prescribed penalty to which he is subject will no longer be applicable to him". Chapter VII General Chapter on Passing Judgments and Despising Him 
(1500) 7 Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Abu-Al-Darda had written to Salman al-Farisi, "Come to the Holy Land, to which Salman replied: “The land sanctifies no one; it's rather his works that make man holy. I have been told that you have been appointed judge, in charge of people's affairs; so if you succeed in judging fairly, that happiness be granted to you, and if you do not succeed, take your precautions not to have a man killed, and that you find yourself in Hell”. Thus, each time Abu Al-Darda insisted on to judge two litigants, as they left, he stared at them and said to them: “Come back to me, and tell me again, your accusations; by Allah, I give only proper judgments. - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: “Whoever seeks the help of a slave, without having had the permit of his master, in order to perform any work for him where he will pay him a salary, he must ensure the safety of this slave. In case where he accomplishes this work without being subjected to an accident or any harm whatsoever, if the master of this slave claims his salary, the man must pay it to him. And this is what is followed with us (in Medina)”. - Also Malek said: “in case a slave is half-freed half-slave, he retains for himself, his salary, however, he will not be able to fully dispose of this salary, except for his food and his clothing as far as possible; but if he dies, all his money goes to the man who didn't have it. not freed". - Finally, Malek said, “The standard followed at Medina, allows the father to claim from his son the expenses he had incurred, if the latter already possesses property; whether it be flowing funds or goods, according to what the father envisages”. 
(1501) 8 - Omar Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Dalaf Al-Mouzani reported from his father that a man from Jouhaina, anticipated the period of the pilgrimage, bought mounts to make them more expensive, then hurried to arrive earlier than the pilgrims. He went bankrupt, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab was informed about him, who said: “This done, O men! This man Oussaïfé of the Jouhaina tribe was satisfied, that people say of him, about his faith and his sincerity, that he arrived before the pilgrims. Now, he has become indebted, and is in a difficult situation, those to whom this man, owes money, that they come to us tomorrow morning, so that we share with them what he left. So, avoid debt, because its beginning is a pain, and its end is an embarrassment”. Chapter IX The subject of losses and injuries caused by slaves. (1502) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: "The sunna followed in Medina, concerning an offense caused by the slave, requires the following: "Anything that a slave may cause, injury to a person, or an object that he steals , or a sheep which he seizes at night outside an enclosure, or a branch of a tree, which bearing fruit, he cuts or destroys, or again any kind of theft, which is not subject to the prescribed penalty requiring that the hand be cut off, and which, generally, does not exceed the price of this slave. indemnity for this offence, and he keeps his slave, or he hands him over to the damaged person, as he chooses, without owing anything else". Chapter X What is allowed as a gift 
(1503) 9 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab reported that Osman Ibn Affan said: "Whoever makes a gift to his minor child without the latter being able to take care of it, he must declare his gift publicly, being confirmed by witnesses, this is allowed to the father and he has the right to recover it, in case his son dies”. - Malek said: “The rule followed at home (at Medina), about the one who gives his minor son a gift, gold or silver, and he dies, so that his son inherits it, nothing will return to the latter, except in the case where his father had completely set aside this gift, or that he had given it in deposit to a third person; if he does so, this gift will be of the right of the son”. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 38 The Book of Postage and Patronage Chapter I Of him who frees his share in a slave 
(1504) 1 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "He who frees his share in a slave, while having enough money, for the price of the slave, one will make estimate of the value of this slave, so that the one who took the initiative of the postage, pays to the partners, their shares, making that his postage is total; otherwise, the slave will not be completely freed”. - Malek said: “What is followed at home (at Medina), concerning the slave whom his master has partially freed, and whom the associates have freed either by a quarter, or by a third or by a half, that this slave is only partially freed, according to what has been quoted from by his master. Therefore this postage partial is obligatory, as long as the man (owner of the slave) is dead, although if the latter were still alive, he should have had a complete choice in this matter. Thus, after the death of the master (the testator), the slave finds himself only partially freed, namely, in proportion to the value of the bequest made by the deceased; as for the legacy of the latter, it is due rights of heirs. This done, how can one demand of others that they free the slave, without them having themselves had, the initiative of the postage, nor even, that they highlighted it; therefore, they no longer even have the right of patronage. So, in fact, it is the man who died, who was for the emancipation of the slave and to whom belongs the right of patronage, without however entrusting others with the emancipation of their shares. However, if the deceased had, in his will, made a legacy where one must pay to the others their shares for the total emancipation of the succession, the slave will be absolutely freed and the partners will not have to refuse this, from the moment that the dead had disposed of the third of his property, without this causing damage to his heirs". - And Malek to say: "In case a sick man frees the third of slave and that definitively, this one will be absolutely freed thanks to this third of the estate; this case is not similar to that where a man makes a legacy to free the third of his slave, after his death, for the good reason, that if this man is still alive, he will have the right to return on this legacy, and no longer free his slave. Also, the slave, whose master freed him from the third, when he was sick, should have, if he had always been alive, totally free his slave. But if the man dies, the slave will be freed from the third party, since the dead has the right to bequeath a third of his property, just like a healthy man who can enjoy all his property”. Chapter II The postage condition 
(1505) 2 - Malek said: “The slave who was absolutely freed so that one can attribute to him all the rights of a free man, namely the testimony, and the inheritance, his master can no longer subject him to the conditions to which another slave submits, such as the payment of the price of freedom, or work to be done, or subject him to a charge of slavery, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever frees a slave for his share, that slave will be esteemed at his just value, and he will give his associates their part, while assuming alone the complete emancipation of this slave". - Malek said: "So this slave being of the belonging of this man alone, instead of freeing him partially, it is his right to enfranchise him completely and set him free completely”. Chapter III He who frees his slaves without having any other property 
(1506) 3 - Muhammad Ibn Sirin reported that a man, at the time of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had freed, at his death, his six slaves without being possessor of other goods. So, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) drew lots to set free a third of these slaves”. - Malek said: “I was told that the man in question did not have any other property”. (1507)4- Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdul-Rahman reported that a man had, when Aban Ibn Osman was governor in Medina, freed all his slaves, without possessing any other property apart from them. Then Aban ordered, to distribute these slaves in three categories, then made on their subject, a draw, so that one can indicate the third of these slaves who, later, was freed”. Chapter IV Of the judgment made respecting the property of a slave, if he finds himself freed 
(1508) 5 Malek reported that he heard Ibn Chehab say: "The sunna requires that, as soon as the slave is freed, this one must have all his goods". - Malek also said: "What justifies, that the slave freedman, must have his goods, is that the contractual freedman says: "Al-Mukatab", has his postage which belongs to him in person, and also to his property, even if he did not ask for it; this is explained by the fact that the contract of emancipation is also a contract of patronage, if this has already been decided, without it being considered that the goods of the slave and of the contractual freedman are taken from it. same title as their children. In fact their children are like them slaves, and are not taken as property, because it is the sunna, incontestably followed, that the freed slave must have his property, but without this freeing his children; it is the same for the contractual freedman, who is freed, this will be for his property, but not for his children. - Malek further added: “what justifies this, it is that, from the moment that the slave and the contractual freedman, know deficit, one must remove their goods and their wives, independently of their children because these are not their goods. Also, this is justified by the fact that, if the slave is sold, and his buyer demands that he still have his property, his children will not be part of his property. Eventually, Malek says, "if the slave is injured, he himself is taken as well as his property, regardless of his children." Chapter V The Liberation of Enslaved Mothers and the Judgment Made About Emancipation 
(1509) 6 - Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “All a slave who gives birth to a child of her master, the latter may neither sell her, nor make a gift of her, nor consider her an heiress; however he can enjoy his person, and at his death, he will be liberated”. 
(1510) 7 - It was reported to Malek, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, had received in his home a slave whom his master had tortured with fire, or with what, he had harmed her, Omar freed her”. - Malek said: “What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), it is that we do not tolerate the liberation of a man whose debt is beyond his value, nor even the emancipation of a young slave until he has not reached the age of puberty, nor the release of a slave, who is pubescent and who does not however have the right to dispose of his property before he actually has the right to dispose of it ". Chapter VI Slaves permitted to be freed when freeing is compulsory 
(1511) 8 - Omar Ibn Al-Hakam reported: “I came to find the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah I have a female slave who leads the herd to pasture; in the meeting, I realized that she had lost a sheep, I asked her to explain this to me, and she answered me that the wolf devoured her, I got angry, and being a human being, I slapped. I had a slave to free, can I free her in her place? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) asked the slave: “Where is Allah”? In heaven, she replied”; he asked him: "Who am I"? Responding to him: "You are the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) , he then said, "Free her." 
(1512) 9 - Oubaidallah Ibn Abdallah Ibn Utba Ibn Mass'oud reported: "A man from the Ansar, brought a black slave, with him, came to find the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's favor and peace) and said to him: "O Messenger of Allah I have to free a slave, but if you find that this slave is a believer, I will free her». The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) addressing the slave said to him: “do you bear witness that there is no god but Allah”? "Answering yes", he asked him again: "Do you bear witness that I am the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam)"? "Responding, again, with a yes", he finally asks her: "Do you believe in the resurrection after death"?; his answer being, a yes, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) then said to the man: “Free her”. 
(1513) 10 • Al-Maqbouri reported that they asked Abou Houraira, about the man who has a slave to free, will he be able to free an adulterine slave? Abu Huraira replied: “yes, certainly, and that will be considered a release for him”. 
(1514) 11 - Fadala Ibn Oubaid Al-Ansari, who, moreover, was one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), was asked about a man, who has a slave to free, will he be allowed to free an adulterous slave? “Yes, certainly, he replied, and that will be considered a release for him”. Chapter VII What is not tolerated as mandatory release 
(1515) 12 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Omar, was asked to determine if one could buy a slave for the specific purpose of the obligatory emancipation of a slave”? He replied, “No”. - Interpreting this, Malek said, "This is what I have better understood on the subject of the obligatory franking of one or a slave, where that which intends to free it, must not buy it later, nor either to advance such a condition. For if he were to do so, his emancipation would not be complete, from moment that he would pay for this slave, a price lower than his real price". And Malek added: “There is no harm in a man freely buying a slave and then freeing him”. - On the other hand, Malek said, “What I heard from better about the compulsory freeing of a slave, it is that one cannot free neither a Christian, nor a Jew, nor a contractual slave, nor a posthumous freedman, nor a slave who has become mother, nor a slave for a few years, nor a blind man. But, there is no harm in arbitrarily releasing a Christian, a Jew or a Magus, for Allah Blessed and Most High, has said in His Book َ د اء { َ م ا ف َ و إ َ م ً ن ا بَ ْع ُد َ م ا } َ ف إ (meaning): “ Then you will choose between their release and their ransom ” (Koran XLVII, v.4). This liberation is nothing other than emancipation”. - Malek finally said, “So the slaves, mentioned in the Book of Allah, which are to be franked, must only be believers”. Similarly, when it comes to giving food to the poor, under the title of an expiation, it can only be done for Muslims, emphasizing that this is not allowed for those who are of a other religion”. Chapter VIII The liberation made by a living person for a dead person 
(1516) 13 - Abdul Rahman Ibn Abi Amra Al-Ansari reported that his mother wanted to make a will, and delayed it until the morning she died, when she intended to free a slave". Thus, Abdul Rahman, questioned Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad on this subject, and asked her, if she will be rewarded if he frees the slave in her place, Al-Kassem replied: "Sa'd Ibn Oubada had asked the same question to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and he replied: "Yes". 
(1517) 14 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Abdul-Rahman Ibn Abu Bakr died accidentally, Aisha, the Prophet's wife (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) frees several slaves in his title. Malek said, "That's the best I've heard." Chapter IX The excellence of freeing a slave, a profligate, and an adulterer 
(1518) 15 - Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) was asked to (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) which of the slaves, is it better to free”? He replied, "The one that is the most expensive, and that his master most wants to retain." (...) 16 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar freed an adulterer and his slave mother». Chapter X The right to grant patronage to the person making the postage 
(1519) 17 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported: "Barira comes to tell me: "I had concluded with my masters, to pay them, concerning my postage, nine ounces of silver, in such a way that one ounce is paid every year, and I ask you to support me". Aicha replied: “If your people accept that I pay them this sum in your place so that you are freed, I will do it, on condition that I patronize you”. Going to his masters to teach them Aicha's proposal, and that they refused it, Barira returned to Aisha, while the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) was at her house, and said to her: "I had reported your proposal to them, but they refused it, wanting have to them the right of my patronage". Listening to this, the Messenger of Allah r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) asked Aisha, to explain it to him; once, informed, he addressed Aicha, saying to her: «bring her, and ask them, the right to patronize her, because this right belongs to him who freed», Aicha, accomplishes what he says to him; the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) arose, among the people, then gave praise and glorification to Allah, and said: “Then! What happens to men to put forward conditions, which are not in The Book of Allah? thus, any condition that was not mentioned in The Book of Allah, is invalid, even if these conditions are one hundred in number; therefore the right of Allah is the most meritorious and the strongest, moreover, the right of patronage belongs to the one who frees. 
(1520) 18 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that Aisha, the mother of believers intended to buy herself a slave to free her, her masters said to her: "We will sell her to you, only at provided that we hold the right to his patronage”. Aicha, teaching this to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) he said to him: “Let nothing prevent you from buying it and freeing it; for patronage is the right of the person who made the postage”. 
(1521) 19 - Amra Bint Abdul Rahman reported that Barira, came to ask Aicha, the mother of the believers, to support her, this one said to him: "If your masters wish that I pay them all the sum, so that I free you, I will do it". Barira, let it be known this to his masters, they refused, saying: “No, except, in case we had the right to patronize you”. Amra, learned this from Aisha, she in turn reported it to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) , (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said to him: "Buy it, and free her, because the right of patronage belongs to the one who freed”. 
(1522) 20 Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam),r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade the sale of the right of patronage, and to make it a donation". - About a slave who is bought from his masters, provided he himself chooses who will patronize him, Malek said, “This is not permitted, for patronage is the right of the one who freed. Although, if a man gives to him whom he frees, the right to belong to him whom he chooses himself, this is also not permitted, for the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Patronage is the right of him who freed", prohibiting, however, that this right be sold, or made as a gift. Thereby. if the man tolerates to his freedman the right to choose himself, his boss, or even that he allows it, this is considered as a gift, is moreover prohibited”. Chapter XI Of liberation, which implies the right of patronage 
(1523) 21 • Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman reported that Al-Zoubair Ibn Al-Awam had bought a slave and freed him. This slave, had children of a free woman, and Al-Zoubair having freed him, says to him: “These children are my freedmen”, and on their behalf, the close relations of the mother claim them as being of theirs. Bringing their accusations to Osman Ibn Affan, he gave Al-Zoubair the right to patronize them”. (...) 22 - It was reported to Malek, that Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab, asked about a slave who has children from a free woman, who should be given the right to patronize them? Sa'id replied, "If their father dies, before he is freed, the right of their patronage reverts to their mother's relatives." - Malek said: "This case is similar to the one of an adulterine child, who, attached to his mother's relatives, patronize him, inherit him even if he dies, and still pay him legal compensation or blood money in case he commits a crime or misdemeanour. However if his father recognizes him (as a son), this child will be attached to him and his relatives, and as a result will be able to inherit him, just as they will pay him legal compensation or blood money, if he had committed a crime or an offense, on the other hand, his father will be subjected to the prescribed penalty (namely, that he will be flogged". - Malek to continue: “So is the case of a free Arab woman, practicing adultery; if her husband accuses her about it and calls a curse on her, and does not not recognize the son brought into the world. However, the inheritance of this child at his death will return to the Muslims, after the part of the mother and his uterine brothers has been set aside, unless the father does not attach the child in question, to him. Because this child, before he was recognized by his father, he had been subordinated to the patronage of his mother's relatives, since he had neither membership nor "assaba". Thus, thanks to the recognition of the father, his belonging returned to his “assaba”. - Malek to add: "what is followed, with us (at Medina), about a child whose father is a slave, and mother is free, and the slave's father happens to be free, is that the grandfather, namely, the father of the slave, can take away the right to patronize free children, born of a free woman; therefore, this grandfather can inherit them, as long as their father is still a slave. However, if the slave father is freed, the right to the patronage of the children reverts to the relatives of the father, and if he dies while being a slave, their patronage and inheritance revert to the grandfather. If the slave has two free children, and one of them dies while the father is a slave, the grandfather takes the right of both patronage and inheritance”. - On the other hand, about a slave, who found freed while she is pregnant, while her husband is a slave, and then freed after she gives birth to her child, Malek said, “The patronage of the newborn is the right of him who had freed his mother, because this infant would have been subject to slavery, if his mother had not previously been freed, especially since he is not considered on the same footing as that, who was still in her mother's lap, after her emancipation; for if it were so, and his father is no longer a slave, he takes away the right to patronize him”. - Eventually, Malek said, "For the slave who asks his master to allow him the freeing of another slave who belongs to him, and that his master grants it to him: the right patronage belongs to the master of the slave and no longer to the slave who had been freed". Chapter XII The subject of the "Walaa" legacy 
(1524) 23 - Hicham reported from his father that Al-Assi Ibn Hisham died leaving three sons, two of whom are siblings, and the other is consanguineous. One of the two siblings having died, leaving property and freedmen, it was his full brother who inherited the property and the Walaa of the freedmen. Then the latter, dying in his turn, he leaves a son, and a consanguineous brother. So his son said, “I have the right to inherit everything that my father had acquired in property and also the Walaa of the freedmen. However, the consanguineous brother, protesting, said to him: “No, you only have the right to inherit the goods, as for the Walaa, you do not have the right. Besides, if my brother died today, wouldn't I have the right to inherit him? Both wearing their accusations to Omar Ibn Affan, the latter granted the Walaa to the brother". 
(1525) 24 - Abdallah Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Hazm a reported from his father, that while sitting with Aban Ibn Osman, a group from Bani Jouhaina, and another from Bani Khazraj, submitted their differences to him, on the occasion of which, he was told that a woman from Jouhaina who was the wife of Al-Hareth Ibn Al-Khazraj called Ibrahim Ibn Kulaib, died, leaving property and freedmen. Thereby, her son and her husband inherit it; then his son died, his heirs said: "it is up to us to have the Walaa (1) of the freedmen as long as it is the son who enjoyed this right". The men of the Jouhaina replied: “No, it is not so, because the heirs do not are only freedmen of the mother, who was of us; but her son being dead, the Walaa is our right, and we must inherit them”. Thus Aban granted the men of Jouhaina the Walaa». (1) The Walaa is said of any right of patronage, to the holding of the one who makes a postage, by proceeding to multiple means such as the contract, or posthumous, or other. 
(1526) 25 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said about a man who dies leaving three sons, and freedmen, after which two of his sons die, leaving children”. Sa'id says, “the third son will inherit the Walaa; and if he dies in his turn, the Walla of the freedmen will be granted both to the children of the one who has just died, and to the children of his brother, in an equitable and legitimate manner”. Chapter XIII Of the legacy of the so-called “Saiba” slave and of the Walaa of those who emancipate Jews and Christians 
(1527) 26 - Malek asked Ibn Chehab, about the “Saiba”? He replied, “He can give the right of his patronage to whomever he wishes; so if he dies, he will not grant it to anyone, his inheritance will therefore go to the Muslims, who are responsible for paying him the legal compensation”. - Malek said, "The best I've heard at about the 'Saiba' is that it is not owned by anyone; as for his inheritance, it is the right of the Muslims, on condition that they pay him the legal compensation, if he had to do so”. - And Malek added: "In case the slave of a Jew or of a Christian, becomes a follower of Islam, and his master frees him before he is sold, the Walaa of this freed slave, returns to the Muslims; and if the Jew or the Christian, in turn, become partisans of Islam, the Walaa of the liberated will not be his. But if a Jew or a Christian releases a slave, while he is of their religion, after which he will have converted to Islam, even before those who released him, namely the Jew or the Christian , have themselves converted to Islam, the Walaa returns to the freer, because this was justified to him from the very day he freed”. “Saiba” (2) These are the slave, freed by his master, without him granting him the right of patronage, but rather giving it to the freedman. - Malek finally said: "If a Jew or a Christian had a Muslim child, the latter inherits the freedmen from his Jewish or Christian father if the freedman showed himself to be a follower of Islam before this was followed by the freedman; on the other hand the Muslim child of a Jew or a Christian does not inherit the Walaa of the Muslim freedman, as long as this Walaa belongs neither to the Jew nor to the Christian, but to the Muslim community”. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 39 The Book of the contractual freedman and said "AI-Moukatab" Chapter 1 The judgment made about the contractual freedman. (1528)1 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: "The so-called moukatab still freed by contract, will always remain held as a slave, as long as he has a certain sum, which has not yet been paid, of the price of his release". 
(1529) 2 - It was reported to Malek, that Urwa Ibn Al-Zoubair and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar said: "As long as the mukatab has not yet paid the full sum, constituting the price of his emancipation, he is still a slave". And Malek adds: “And such is my opinion”. - Malek said, “If the moukatab dies, leaving a sum of money, exceeding that which is to him of the price of his postage which he had already concluded, or that on their subject, he had concluded a similar contract, his children will have the right to inherit what remains of his property, if the price of his postage had already been fully paid. 
(1530) 3 - Houmaid Ibn Qais al-Makki reported that Ibn al-Moutawakel had a mukatab, who died in Mecca, leaving some terms of the cost of his postage as well as the debts he owed to people, and leaving another daughter. The prefect of Mecca, falling into embarrassment, wanting to judge this affair, he sent to ask in writing on this subject, to Abdul Malek Ibn Marwan, who in turn answered him in writing: "First discharge the debts of the creditors, then complete what remains of the price of his emancipation, and finally, divide equally what remains of his goods, between his daughter and his master". (1) “The moukatab" is said of the slave, who must obtain from his master, a postage, having concluded a contract with him by virtue of which he will pay him a fixed sum which extends according to the terms of this contract. This type of contract has been given the name of “kitaba”. - Malek said: “what is followed (with us) at Medina is that the master of the slave is under no circumstances obliged to conclude a contract with his slave, if the latter asks him to. And I have not even heard any imam compel a master to conclude such contract with his slave. Still, I happened to know that, asked about it, a man versed in religion replied, “Allah Blessed and Most High has said (meaning): “…..Draw up a contract of freedom for those of your slaves who desire it, if you recognize in them qualities…..” (Koran XXIV, verse 33), again this man recited the following two verses (meaning): “….hunt when you have returned to the profane state….” (Koran V,2) and: “….when the prayer is finished, scatter yourselves in the land, and seek the grace of Allah” (Koran LXII,10). Interpreting this, Malek said, “This, is a tolerance from Allah, granted to people although it is not obligatory. - Malek said: “I heard some men versed in religion, say about the following verse: “…and give them goods which Allah has bestowed upon you…” (Koran XXIV.33), that one implies, that the man can conclude a contract of emancipation with his slave, then can make him a handing-over of a given sum at the end of the acquittal. This is, moreover, what I have heard, men versed in religion, say and which was followed by the people in Medina. I was even told that Abdallah Ibn Omar had concluded a freeing contract with his slave for a sum which is thirty and five thousand dirhams, and as a result, he gave her a discount of five thousand”. - On the other hand Malek added: “What is followed at Medina, about the slave with whom his master had concluded a contract of emancipation, it is that the latter will free the goods of the freedman, which will not be for his children, unless the master had them , again them, included in the contract”. - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say to the subject of the "moukatab", who had concluded a contract of emancipation with his master, while having to him a pregnant slave, of whom he was unaware of the affair, as well as his master, during the contract, as well as the child once born, will not be part of the contract, and will therefore be a slave of the master; as for the female slave, she is already freed because she was an integral part of the property of the mukatab”. -About a man who, inheriting from his wife dead, as well as her son, a mukatab, Malek said: “If the mukatab dies before he has fulfilled his Kitaba, the man and the son will divide his inheritance according to what is prescribed in the Book of Allah; but if the moukatab had paid in full the price of his postage, all his inheritance will revert to the son without anything being given to the husband”. - About the moukatab who concludes with his slave a Kitaba, Malek said: “We are checking this contract, so if it has been done on the part of the Moukattab to show himself kind to his slave, and to want to lighten his work for him, this is not tolerated. But if this contract was made by desire, or by need of money, or even still to have the advantage and the assistance, that is tolerated. -About the man, who concluded with his slave (female) a contract, Malek said: "If, because of having had sex with her, she has become pregnant, she will have to choose: or whether she is the mother of the child, or that she be freed, once her Kitaba was accomplished. If it turns out that she is not pregnant, she is at her kitaba”. - Malek said: “what is followed at home (at Medina) in the case where a slave belongs to two men, it is not tolerated that one of them concludes a Kitaba, while his partner wants or does not allow him, from the moment that the two must agree on the Kitaba, because this constitutes for the slave a complete emancipation. If this Kitaba is made by one of the two partners, the slave will be half freed, and the other partner cannot be made to free the other half; therefore, it will be a contradiction with the words of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said: "Whoever frees the part he owns about a slave, must free him completely if it is possible for him, after having made the evaluation of the slave”. - Malek to continue: "if the partner ignores the Kitaba on the other, until the slave has completed the payment of his Kitaba or even before, we must give him back what he already had to pay. paid, and the two partners will share the sum already paid between them in proportion to their share; consequently the Kitaba will be annulled, and the slave will remain common to both partners”. - For the contractual freedman who is belonging to two men, and it is a fact that one of them granted the slave a period of time to pay, as for the other, he granted it to him. refused, the latter is inclined, says Malek, to fix what is of his right, especially if the slave dies, leaving a sum that does not allow him to pay in full". Still on this subject, Malek said: “both partners will receive what is due to them, in a proportional way, each his share; as for what is of the remainder of the price of the franking which is as a surplus left by the slave, it will be divided between the two partners with equality. If the slave had not fully paid the whole sum, and the one who had refused to grant him a delay had received more than his partner of the sum in question, the price of the slave would be shared equally. between the two partners, and the sum already received by one of the partners is not to be reimbursed, because he only received it after consultation with his partner. On the other hand, if one of the two partners had remitted what he owes, and the other had received an additional sum, the latter owes nothing with regard to the former who, moreover, had only received what was due to him; as for the price of the slave, it is to be divided equally between the two. This case is to be compared to that where one has a debt which a single debtor must discharge to two men where one of them had granted him a delay, while the other had already partially recovered what is in his right, and the debtor is made bankrupt; so the creditor who had already received part of the debt, must not repay any sum to the other”. Chapter II Postage Price Guarantee 
(1531) 4 - Malek said: "what is unquestionably followed in Medina, when a group of slaves concludes a contract of collective emancipation, it is that each one can be guarantor of the others, and nothing of the price of their emancipation is to be given to the death of one of them, as long as their contract is collective. Thus, if one of them declares that he is unable to pay, his companions can assign him a job that he can accomplish according to his abilities, while maintaining their solidarity with him, so that he will be released once they are all released, or it will remain enslaved as long as they are". - Malek to continue: “what is followed with us (at Medina), concerning a slave concluding with his master, a contract of emancipation, it is that this master does not have the right to accept that another takes charge in his place, the guarantee concerning of his slave, whether he dies or becomes incapable of acquittal. Also, this is not the sunnah of Muslims, because if a third person guarantees the slave, and the latter is still unable to pay, even though the master has already recovered the amount of the contract of the guarantor, he would thus have had illicit money, namely that, on the one hand he did not buy the slave and what he will have paid as price will return to him, and on the other hand the slave will not have been set free from the illicit price of his postage. If the slave finds himself unable to pay his own price, it remains his master's propriety that the contract of freedom is not taken as a debt guaranteed by a third person, but rather considered an obligation which, once the slave fulfills it, will be set free. Else hand, if the contractual freedman dies, while having a debt to pay, the creditors will not have to claim what remains of the Kitaba of this slave, of his master, although they have on this subject, their primacy in relation to the master, Finally, if the contractual freedman finds himself unable to pay the debt he owes to people, he will remain a slave belonging to his master, and his debt will remain at its debit, without it being the right of the creditors to announce its price, which is, in fact, property due to its master". - Finally Malek said: “If a group of slaves concludes a collective franking contract, without having a family relationship between them which allows them to inherit one from the other, they will be considered in full defense of each other, and still guaranteeing each other mutually, they will all be freed only after having paid the amount of the contract. In the event that one of them dies, leaving to himself property, the value of which exceeds the sum which they all together owe, the sum which they owe is subtracted, and for what remains, it returns to the master. of the slave without the other slaves have nothing to do. Also, the master will claim from the slaves, the payment of what they owed, namely the sum which was subtracted from them of the goods left by the dead slave, for the good reason, that this one, had given them the price they had to pay, to be freed, and which was his own property. On the other hand, if the dead slave had a child who will have to be born after the freeing contract has been concluded, this child will inherit nothing from his father because the latter had not been freed before his death. dead". Chapter III Flat-rate contractual postage 
(1532) 5 - It was reported to Malek that Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) concluded with her slaves, franking contracts, by collecting their price in advance, both in silver and in gold”. - Malek said: “What is unquestionably followed about a contractual freedman, common to two masters, it is that it is not allowed for one of them, to free this slave, by asking a fixed price, without having had the consultation of his partner, as long as the slave in question as well as what he owns belong to both partners; therefore it is not tolerated that one of them seizes anything without having had the permit of the other. If one of them was going to act without having had the permitted by the other, and that it is done that the slave dies leaving his property, or that he is unable to pay his own price, the partner who had already freed the slave will have nothing of his property, therefore he will not have to return anything of what he already had. himself had, to his partner, and therefore he will have no right over this slave. But he who frees his slave for a fixed price, having had his partner's permit, then the slave finds himself unable to complete his freeing contract, the one who had him freed can, if he wants, return what he had already taken and will continue to enjoy his right on this slave, moreover, that is allowed to him. If the slave dies leaving property, the partner who had not yet freed him will have what is his right to what remains of the price of the postage, as for the rest of the goods, it will be divided between the two partners, according to the part which each has in this slave. In the event that one of the two partners has already received the fixed price of the slave, and that, on the other hand, the other maintains the contract, then that the slave is found incapable, one will say to the first: " If you want, you can give your partner half the price you already had received, and the slave is common to both of you, otherwise the slave is the possession of the one who still holds the contract on him". - About the slave owned by two partners, where one of them seeks to free him, for a lump sum while having had the permit of the other, who in turn asks for the same sum taken by the other or more, and that the slave se found incapable, Malek said, “The slave remains common to both, for the second has received what is his right; if he receives less than the sum received by the first and the slave finds himself incapable, so that the first accounts to render to the second half of the difference of the sum which he had already had provided that the slave is possessed of it equally between the two, this is permitted to him; in case he refuses it, the slave will remain in the possession of the second. In case the mukatab dies leaving property, and the partner who had already freed him, wants to return to the other half of this that he had obtained from more than him, in such a way that the inheritance of the goods of the slave, is shared with equality between the two, he can do it. If, the one who maintained the contract had, on his part, had the same sum as the first or even more, the inheritance will be proportionally distributed, suitably to the shares of possession as long as the second had only received what was due to him. - Concerning the moukatab, which belongs to two partners, and where one of them frees him by receiving half of what is his right, while having had his partner's permit, as for the other who still maintains the contract he receives less than the sum the first had already had, and the mukatab found himself unable to complete his freeing contract, Malek said, "If the partner, who had already freed the slave, is willing to return to the other half the difference, the slave belongs to them equally, and if he refuses to return to him, the one who maintains the contract, will have half of the share of his partner. Interpreting this, Malek says, "The slave being owned equally between them, and both of them had entered into a contract of emancipation with him for a certain sum, and then let one set the slave free while having permission on the other, thus receiving half of his share, which is a quarter of the real price of the slave, and that the latter is incapable of the acquittal, one The first partner will then say: "You can give back to your partner half of what you had received and the slave is owned equally by you both. If you refuse, whoever maintains the contract will be entitled at a quarter of the price and still his own half of the slave, which means that he will have in all three quarters of the slave, while the other will have had only a quarter, that he will have refused to return". - For the moukatab, who for wanting to be released, will go and conclude with his master a contract of emancipation, by prescribing a debt of what remains of the price of his release, and that he dies without having been discharged of this debt and owed debts to others, Malek said, “The master has no right to claim what is his right until the creditors have already received what is due to them and they will even have the primacy of enjoying it. On the other hand, the mukatab does not have the right to carry out such a contract, if he has a debt to pay to the people, thus becoming free while he owns nothing, because the creditors have more than the master of this slave, the right to claim their debt". So this is not tolerated for him. - Malek, finally said: "What we follow at home (in Medina), about a man, who makes with his slave, a contract of emancipation, thus stipulating a sum of gold by giving him a discount of the amount of the contract, if he pays him in advance, there is nothing wrong with that. However some have refused this kind of contract, because it is taken in the same way as a debt that a man owes to another, handing it over to him on condition that he pays it before the due date. Now, this fact is not actually a debt, but rather a lump sum, which the master asks in advance for emancipation, consequently the slave will have to enjoy the rights of inheritance, testimony and will even be subject to the prescribed penalties just like a free man. So it's not about buying cash for cash or gold against gold, but his case is like that where a man says to his slave: "Bring me such and such dinars, and you will be freed", and he discounts her that way. Or even that the man says: “If you bring me less than such, you will be released”, and there again, it is not a question of a well determined debt; for if the debt were such, and the slave died or made a deficit, the master would have the right to claim what is his ghost, the property of the slave, just as the creditors will do”. Chapter IV Injuries caused by a mukattab 
(1533) 6 - Malek said: “What I heard from better about a mukattab that hurts a person, is the following: “If the mukattab causes injury to a third person, in such a way that he is subject to the payment of compensation, if he is able to do so with his kitaba, let him do so while maintaining his kitaba; but if he is unable to do so, we do not consider his kitaba until he paid the price for his crime. If he still proves unable to do so, it is up to his master to choose: either he pays the compensation and keeps the mukattab still a slave, or he hands him over to the injured man, and he will not have not to act otherwise, that is, apart from these two cases”. In the event that a good number of mukattabs have concluded a collective contract, and that it happens that one of them causes an injury to a man where he has to pay compensation, Malek said: “all mukatabs are asked to pay this compensation; so, if they do, they will maintain their Kitaba, otherwise their master is granted the choice of either paying compensation for the injury and keeps, therefore, the mukatabs as slaves, or that he delivers the slave responsible for the injury, alone, independently of the other slaves he keeps and this, because they fail to pay the price of their companion's crime". - Malek said, "What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), in case a mukattab receives an injury deserving compensation, or even if one of the sons of the mukattab has suffered an injury and is included in the kittaba, the compensation which will be payable must be relative to the value of the slaves; thus, the compensation paid, is to be given to the master who keeps it until the end of the kitaba to be reduced by the last term of the kitaba”. - Interpreting this, Malek said: "It is assumed that the value of the kitaba is three thousand dirhams, and that the compensation corresponding to the wound of the mukattab is one thousand dirhams, if the mukattab gave his master two thousand dirhams, he would be released, even if he still had his kitaba, a thousand dirhams to pay. Thus, it will be released once this sum is given to the master. If the remaining value of the kitaba is less than one thousand dirhams, the master will receive what is his right and give the surplus to the mukattab. In any case, it is better not to give the mukattab the compensation for his injury which he can either spend or consume, especially since, once he finds himself unable to discharge his kitaba, he will remain a one-eyed slave, or amputated or deformed, as long as his master does not had entered into the kitaba with him only to have a share of what he earns and also his goods, and not to enslave his son, nor even to have the compensation for his injury which he will have either consumed or spent. So, just as we have shown, that compensation which is to be paid as a result of an injury caused to a mukattab or his children; born during the kitaba period and who are part of it, is to be given to the master who in turn will make a decrease in it, at the mukattab, just at the end of the last term of the kitaba”. Chapter V From the sale of the mukattab 
(1534) 7 - Malek said: “What was heard better, said about a man buying a mukatab from another, is that the latter did not sell it to him, if his kitaba was made against silver or gold, namely dirhams or dinars, unless the price was that of a commodity to be delivered as soon as possible, on the other hand if the price is to be delayed, it will be considered as a debt against a debt, but such a transaction had been prohibited". If, on the other hand, the subject of the kitaba was a commodity which is either camels or cows or sheep or slaves, it is tolerated for the buyer to buy the moukatab against gold, money or even of a different commodity in its nature from that of the kitaba made by the master, on condition of delivering it as soon as possible and without delaying it”. - Malek to continue: "The best I've heard about a moukatab subject to sale, it is to have to himself much more the right to his kitaba than another buyer, especially if the moukatab has all the power to be able to pay his master the price than the latter fixed him, that he might be set free; consequently, that the slave proceeds to his own purchase, it is already a certain way of freeing himself. Also, postage takes precedence over any other bequest. If this mukatab belongs to several partners, and it is made that one of them will sell his share of the mukatab, whether it is half or a third or a quarter or even one share among many others , the moukatab in this case does not enjoy the right of withdrawal, because this sale is considered to be a fixed price and he can only conclude it after having had the permit to his partners. Therefore, the share sold does not constitute something sacred to him, although the mukatab will not be able to enjoy his goods. Also, whether it is partially sold, this is a risk for the mukatab, because he may find himself incapable as he gradually loses his property, especially since this is not considered to be the purchase of a mukatab on his own unless his master who still having his right on him, does not authorize him, and thus, this moukatab will have more, the right, than any other to buy himself his sold share. - Malek again said: "The sale of one of the terms of a mukatab is illicit, because it is considered a sale random, especially if the mukatab finds himself unable to pay nothing is imposed on him; and if he dies or has a deficit and debts to pay to people, he who had bought himself the term in question will have no share like the other creditors, because having thus reacted by buying this term, he is considered just like the master of the moukatab who will not have to claim his kitaba like the creditors, and it is the same applies to the gain acquired by the moukatab who will go to the creditors without his master having the right to touch a penny”. “There is no harm, continues Malek, in a mukatab buying his own kitaba either from a flowing fund, or from a commodity quite different in nature to what has been the subject of the kitaba, or even that it is of the same nature if it is cash without any delay”. - Malek also said: "the moukatab who dies in leaving a wife, and small children, whether of that wife or another, in such a way that they cannot work, and about whom, they are likely to become incapable of s acquit of their kitaba, Malek underlines: "We will sell the woman-slave, mother of the children, if by her price we pay the kitaba of all the children whether she is their own mother or not, after which they will be freed, as long as their father would not have prevented the sale of the woman-slave, if he had the risk of not being able to pay her kitaba . So therefore, for such children where one fears not being able to discharge their kitaba, one will sell the mother, and one will use her price for the acquittal, but if there is one that her price does not is not enough for the payment of the value of the kitaba, and that it is with the children unable to work, they will all remain enslaved to their master”. - Malek finally said: "what is practiced in us (in Medina) about a man who buys the kitaba from a mukatab, and that the latter dies before his kitaba is completed, the man who bought the kitaba, has the right to 'inherit the mukatab; but if the moukatab finds himself incapable of acquittal with regard to the buyer, he will be his slave; on the other hand, if he pays of his kitaba, he will be freed by the buyer, without the latter even having any right to the patronage which belongs to the former master with whom he had concluded the kitaba”. Chapter VI The work of the mukatab 
(1535) 8 - It was reported to Malek that Urwa Ibn Al-Zoubair and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar were questioned about a man who concluded for himself and his sons, a contract of postage, then he dies, if his sons can work, so that they discharge of the value of this kitaba, or should they remain slaves? They replied, "Rather, they will have to work, so that they discharge it, and nothing will be returned to them (from the kitaba) at the death of their father”. - “And if they are so young, continues Malek, not even being able to bear the work, they will not be expected to be older, and they will remain slaves with their father's master, unless the moukatab - who is their father, by the way - has not left any what to fulfill the terms of the kitaba on them, expecting them to be able to work. So, if what is left is suitable for the discharge of their kitaba, one will use this, and they will remain such, until they are able to work if they discharge, they will be freed , otherwise they will remain enslaved”. - Malek further said, "The mukatab who dies, leaving not enough money for him to fulfill his kitaba, and that he still has children with their mother, who are subject of the kitaba, and where the mother intends to work to ensure their life, Malek must be told that she will be given the money if she proves herself able to keep it, and still able to work. But if she is neither, nothing will be given to her, and she remains with her sons, slaves of the master of the mukatab. - Malek finally said, "If several moukatabs conclude a single franking contract together, without their having a place of kinship between them which unites them, and that some are incapable of working, while the others are, until they discharge of the kitaba and are all freed, those who had worked claim from those who had not worked, what they had paid them, because some are the guarantors of the others". Chapter VII From postage of the moukatab in case he has paid what he owed before the fixed term. 
(1536) 9 - Malek reported that he heard Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdul Rahman and others, tell about a moukatab which belonged to Al-Fourafissa Ibn Oumair al-Hanafi, propose to the latter who is his master, to pay him all he owes him from his kitaba, but Al-Fourafissa refused. Thus, the mukatab went to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam, who was at that time, governor of Medina and told him his business; Marwan summoned al-Fourafissa and asked him to accept, but when the latter refused, Marwan ordered that the mukatab's money be taken and deposited in the public treasury, then told the mukatab: “Go ahead! you are freed, Al-Fourafissa seeing this, agreed to have the money». - Malek said: “What is followed at home (at Medina), about the moukatab is that he is tolerated to pay what he owes of his kitaba before the due date, and his master has no right to refuse him; also he will have to release the moukatab from any condition by allowing him to work and travel, as long as the emancipation of a slave is not complete if he is even partially enslaved by it, and therefore his social condition will not be not sacred, his testimony will not be considered nor will he have to inherit; also he will not enjoy other rights if he still has still paying part of his kitaba. As for his master, he will not have the right to impose work on him, after his emancipation”. - Malek finally said: “About the falling moukatab seriously ill, and therefore intends to pay all that he owes his terms to his master, with the aim that his free children inherit from him without them being subjects of the kitaba, Malek underlines, that this is permitted, for thus his social condition will be sacred, his testimony admitted, his declaration of debts to others accepted, and his will tolerated. Therefore, his master will not have to deny him, claiming to say, "he escaped me by paying the terms of his kitaba." Chapter VIII The succession of the moukatab in case he is freed 
(1537) 10 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab, was questioned about a mukatab common to two masters where one of them had freed his share, following which the mukatab died leaving a good sum of money, which Sa'id said: “We will give the one who maintained the kitaba his share, and for the rest it will be shared equally between the two bosses”. - Malek said: “The moukatab, who completed his kitaba, then who is freed, will be inherited by the men who are closest to him and with whom he had concluded the contract of franking, the day the mukatab dies, whether the heirs are his children or close relatives. It is also, continues Malek, the case of any freed man, where his inheritance goes to those he is those closest to those who freed him, namely children or close relatives, on the day of the death of the mukatab, after he is freed, and therefore he is inherited by patronage”. - Malek finally said, “The brothers in the kitaba are taken in the same way as the children, in case they have all concluded a single contract of postage, and that it is made that neither of them has a child, subject included in the contract, or even born during the kitaba, or that he is subject of the kitaba then one of them dies by leaving money, one uses this money to pay the discharge of what is still due from the terms of the kitaba, and one sets them free. As for the rest of the money, it will go to his children independently of his brothers”. Chapter IX The conditions imposed on the mukatab 
(1538) 11 - About a man who concluded with his slave a kitaba, to be exchanged for gold or silver, by advancing him as a condition in the kitaba, to make a trip, or to perform a service or even to offer him an animal for sacrifice, seeking thereby, to cite everything clearly in the contract, since it is the fact that the moukatab was able to pay everything, to his terms even before the due date, Malek said, “If he has paid all of his terms, and submitted to the condition in question, he will be released and his social condition will be created. Then, we will discuss the condition who submits him to a service to be rendered or to a trip to be made, or other action similar to them, which he can, if need be, accomplish himself, and he is relieved of this charge, without his master has the right to compel him to pay it. As for the sacrifice or clothing or something similar, it will be taken in the same way as the dinars or the dirhams, where one seeks to evaluate it, so that the moukatab pays him with the terms of the contract; therefore, he will not be freed until he has paid everything». - Malek said: “what is followed at home (at Medina), and what is indisputable is that the mukatab is considered as a slave whom the master frees after having enslaved him for ten years. Gold; if the master who freed the slave is dead, before the latter has completed at home ten years of enslavement, what remains of this period, the slave will spend it in the service of the heirs of his master; as for his patronage, it belongs to him who freed him, as well as to his sons and his close relatives”. - Concerning the man who submits his mukatab to the condition of not traveling, nor marrying, nor leaving the country without having had his permission, and consequently if the mukatab does one or another before he had permission, and his kitaba was within reach of the man threatening to cancel it, Malek said, "This man has no right to cancel the kitaba, even if the moukatab had done what is against the condition in question; rather, this man will bring his accusation to the Sultan; thus, the mukatab will not have to marry, nor to travel, nor to leave the country without the permission of his master, whether this is an imposed condition or not, as long as the latter has to conclude a contract of franking with his slave for the value of one hundred dinars, while the moukatab has a nest egg of one thousand dinars or more; therefore, the slave will go and marry a woman, giving her a dowry whose value exceeds the whole sum in question, which will cause the incapacity of the mukatab; consequently, he will return to his master a penniless slave, or that he will travel, neglecting the terms of his kitaba, by his absence, which, in fact, he is not tolerated. For this reason, and according to the kitaba, the master has the full right either to authorize it or to refuse it”. Chapter X The patronage of the mukattab in case he is freed 
(1539) 12 - Malek said: “If the moukatab frees his slave, without having had the permission of his master, that is not permitted to him. But if the master of the mukatab allows it, the right of patronage of the freedman reverts to the mukatab (if he had paid his kitaba). On the other hand, if the mukatab dies, before he is freed, the right of patronage of the slave reverts to the master of the mukatab, and if the freed slave dies before the mukatab is freed, his master must inherit it”. - Malek to continue: “It is the same, if the moukatab concludes a kitaba with his slave who will be freed before the moukatab is freed by his master; thus patronage is the right of the master of the moukatab as long as he is not completely freed. But if he is freed, the patronage belongs to him, namely, that it is the right of the moukatab. If the first mukatab dies before he has paid what is due to him, or even if he is unable to do so, and he has free children, these will not inherit the right to the patronage of their father's mukatab, for the good reason that their father does not yet have the patronage in a sure and certain way, and then he will only have it if he is completely freed". - Malek also said: “The moukatab which is of belonging to two masters and where one of them neglects his share, as for the other he maintains it, then that the moukatab dies leaving money, Malek underlines: "We will give to the one who maintained the postage contract, which again is his right to the kitaba, then the two masters will share the money, as if the mukatab died as a slave, because the first by neglecting his share which he has in the slave, had not yet completely freed him, but he had simply left, what he owes her". - And Malek to say again: "What justifies what precedes, is that it is supposed that a man dies leaving a mukatab, and male and female children, then that one of them has freed his part which he has of the mukatab, this does not give him not allowed of patronage. But if it were a freeing, the patronage will be the right of those who have been freed, of his male and female children”. - Consider again, continues Malek, the case where one partners frees his share of the slave, then the slave becomes unable to pay the kitaba, one does not ask this partner what is left of the kitaba; however, if it was a postage, he should have been asked for it in order to assess the remaining part, and thus recover it from the property of this man, and this is in accordance with the words of the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): "Whoever frees a slave for his share, if he does not have the means to free him completely, thus estimating the price of the slave at his fair value, he will be partially freed". - A third case, presented by Malek, where he is says that: "The incontestably followed Sunnah is that he who frees his share of the slave, this freeing will not take into account his goods, because if he were such, he would have to enjoy, alone, the right of patronage, independently of the other partners. Also it is the sunnah of Muslims, that the right of patronage belongs to the one who concluded the kitaba, and not to those who inherit the master, from the women who had freed their shares from slavery, but rather it is the male heirs and close relatives among men who are entitled to patronage". Chapter XI Cases where postage of mukatabs is not permitted. 
(1540) 13 - Malek said: "If several mukatabs conclude together a single franking contract, their master does not have the right to free one of them, without having had the agreement and the approval of the others, even if they are young, although this agreement and this approval are not obligatory”. Interpreting this, Malek said, "It may be that one of them works in order to free his companions by paying them what they owe from the kitaba, the master will have to free him, which will cause for the others the inability to be able to act just like their companion. He releases the moukata for his own benefit, in their causing others harm. And the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Not to respond to evil with evil,” and this is the hardest of evils.” - Finally Malek said: “In case the slaves conclude together a single kitaba, their master has to free among them the old and the young who can neither discharge nor that one of them has the help and the power to do so. The master then has the permission to do so”. Chapter XII Emancipation from the mukatab of the female slave known as “oum walad”. 
(1541) 14 - Concerning the man who with his slave, concludes a kitaba, then that this slave dies leaving the slave woman, mother of his child, while he still owes part of his kitaba, and the money which is sufficient to discharge it, Malek said, "This woman, mother of her child, still remains a slave when the mukatab is not completely freed until just upon his death, without even leaving children who would be freed once the kitaba had been discharged, thus the mother of their father's child would be freed, thanks to their freedom". - About the moukatab who frees his slave or gives alms of his money, without saying this to his master until he has been freed, and Malek emphasizes on this subject: “the mukatab must accomplish his deed without returning to it. However, if the master of the mukatab learns what is the actions of the latter, he can prevent the mukatab from doing so, because the master, enjoying the power of emancipation, may not free his slave as he can. prevent him from giving alms, unless he allows him to give it voluntarily". Chapter XIII The testament of the mukatab 
(1542) 15 - Malek said, "The best I have heard about the mukatab from which the master frees him, on his death, is as follows: the mukatab is valued, on that day, as if one wanted to sell it, and such would indeed be its real price. Thereby, if it is found that the value is less than what is left of his kitaba, this is subtracted from the third of his inheritance, without considering the amount of money he owes. This is explained, by the fact, that if he were killed, one would impose on his assassin only the payment of the price, valuing him, the day of his murder. On the other hand, if he had been injured, the one who had caused the injury to him will not pay for indemnity than the compensation as assessed on the day of the injury; and we will not consider anything of the value of the kitaba, whether in dinars or dirhams, because as long as he remains to pay of his kitaba, he is taken as a slave, even if the remaining sum is of a value which is less than its own value, and this is not to be subtracted from the third of the deceased's inheritance. Thus, he only has for sum what remains to him of his kitaba, as long as the dead man has made this remainder a simple legacy. - Interpreting this, Malek said, “if the value of the moukatab was one thousand dirhams, and that he only had to pay his kitaba one hundred dirhams, about which the master was going to make a bequest, this sum would be subtracted from him from the third of the inheritance and consequently he would be freed " . - Concerning a man who at his death, concludes with his slave, a kitaba, Malek said: "one will assess his price as a slave, and in case the third of the inheritance is suitable to cover a slave, this is tolerated". - Explaining this, Malek said: “Supposing the value of a slave is one thousand dinars, and that his master concludes, at his death, a kitaba of two hundred dinars, thus, the third of the money possessed by the master is one thousand dinars, this therefore is tolerated for him, because in fact it was a legacy he had made to her. If a master had made for other people a bequest, where it is shown that the third is only suitable for the value of the kitaba, one takes the initiative to the postage of the moukatab, who has the privilege of the legacies, which in turn will be part of the kitaba of the moukatab, so that the moukatab depends on the people to whom the bequest has been given, then we give to the heirs of the testator to choose: if they are willing to give these people their entire inheritance according to the bequest, and that they have the kitaba of the moukatab, they can do so, and if they refuse by delivering, by the very fact, the moukatab and what it owes, to people having right to inheritance, they can also act as such, as long as the moukatab constitutes one third of the inheritance. And because everyone has the right to make a bequest, and where the heirs say: "our testator made a bequest which is beyond one third, so he got what does not belong to him", the heirs will have to choose, and they will be told: “your testator has made the legacy that you already know; so if you want to put into execution, what is of the testator, do it, otherwise give to the legatees a third of the inheritance of the deceased”. - Malek to continue: “so, if the successors deliver the mukatab to the legatees, the latter will have from the moukatab what is due from his kitaba, and if this moukatab executes his kitaba for good, the legatees will have, according to their shares, the value of this kitaba, but if the moukatab is unable to pay, it will be slave of the legatees and not of the heirs, because they delivered him to others by asking them to opt in. Given that the legatees have shown themselves to be guarantors with regard to the mukatab as soon as it has been delivered to them, thus, if he dies, they will have nothing to claim from the heirs. By then, if the moukatab dies, before he pays his kitaba, thus leaving a sum of money which is worth more than that which he owed from his kitaba, this sum will revert to the legatees; and if the mukatab had acquitted himself perfectly, he would be freed, and his patronage would belong to the close relatives of the man with whom the kitaba was concluded”. - Concerning the moukatab, in front of his master the sum of ten thousand dirhams, and that on his death, he gives him a discount of a thousand dirhams, Malek said: “We evaluate the moukatab, in order to fix its price; thus if it is one thousand dirhams, what is already given is only the tenth of the kitaba which is one hundred dirhams, namely a value which is one tenth of the price; therefore he will be given a rebate of the tenth of the kitaba which will effectively be the tenth of the value, as if he had been given a rebate of all that he owes. If this will be accomplished by this way, the third of the money of the deceased will only be considered as suitable to the value of the moukatab which is one thousand dirhams. On the other hand, if he had been given a discount equivalent to half the kitaba, this is to be calculated in one third of the money of the deceased taken for half of the value; and if the discount made was less or more than half, the same method mentioned above is applied. - But, and Malek continues, if a man, upon his death gives his moukatab a discount of one thousand dirhams out of a total of ten thousand, without him quoting if it is done just at the beginning or at the end of his kitaba, we will make a discount of one tenth for each term". Malek said, "When a man at his death makes a delivery of one thousand dirhams to his moukatab without specifying whether it is to be made at the beginning or at the end of the kitaba which is three thousand dirhams, the evaluation of the moukatab will be made by correspondence to that of the money, then the 'we will distribute this discount over all the terms of the kitaba as follows: or calculate for each term its percentage of the discount, taking into account the period between your date of death of the man and that of the due date ; Where subtract this percentage from each term until total payment, namely that one must take into consideration the price of the moukatab as basis of the kitaba, spread over several terms. Once this operation is completed, we calculate the third of the estate of the deceased, if this remittance is equal to or less, the case is settled, if it turns out that it is higher, then we calculate the difference to recover it according to the above-mentioned method”. - About a man who bequeathed to another of a quarter of a mukatab, or even who freed a quarter of this mukatab; then the man dies, and after him the mukatab, but the latter left much more money than he should, Malek says: “One gives to the heirs of the possessor of the mukatab and to the legatee what is still due to them from the mukatab. As for the remaining sum, it will be shared, namely that the legatee will have a third of the sum once the kitaba has been completed; as for the heirs of the possessor, they will have two-thirds, because the moukatab remained slave of its owner as long as he owed the latter the acquittal of his kitaba and as a result, his owner inherits it, being considered a slave", Concerning the moukatab whose master freed him just at his death, Malek said: “If one-third of the property of the deceased is not sufficient for the kitaba to be paid in full, he will be partially freed from corresponding to one-third of the property, thus making a remission of the kitaba. For example, if the mukatab had to be paid for five thousand dirhams, and its value was two thousand, as for the third of the property of the deceased, it was only one thousand, half of the mukatab would be freed, and we would give back half of the kitaba". - About a man who in his will quotes: “Such a slave of my possession is free, and to conclude a kitaba with such another, Malek said: “one begins with the postage, by preference with the kitaba”. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 40 The Book of "Mudabbar" Chapter 1 Sentences applied to the subject of the mudabbar (1) (1) The moudabbar is the slave who will be freed after the death of his owner”. 
(1543) 1 - Malek said: "What is followed in us (in Medina) concerning the one who frees a slave after her death, who, pregnant, gives birth to children from him after she has been freed, but who dies before her master, Malek emphasizes, that her children are taken in the same way as her, namely that they are subject to the same condition, without their mother's death causing them harm. So if he who freed the mother was death, they will in turn be freed if a third of the inheritance suffices as a price”. - Malek said: “So any female who gives birth children, these will be treated similarly to her, namely, if she is free and gives birth after being freed, her children will be free. In the event that she is subsequently freed, or is a moukataba, or is released after a few years, or is in the service of a man for a specified time, or is partially released, or is subject to 'a pawn, or mother of children, the child of any female will be in the same situation as her mother, namely, freed or enslaved, just as she is'. - Concerning a female slave, who pregnant, will be freed posthumously her child will experience the same situation; besides, she is just like the woman slave whose master will free her, unaware that she was pregnant”. Thus, it is from the sunna that the child in be of the same condition as his mother, namely, to be freed if she is". - It is the same, continues Malek, for the man who buys a pregnant slave woman, of whom he will be the possessor, whether he has asked the seller for it or not" "Besides, continues Malek, it is not tolerated for the seller to sell the slave woman, in excluding what is in his lap, as this is a sale which will devalue the price of the slave, without knowing whether the fetus is alive or dead. This case is similar to that of a man who sells what is in the bosom of his mother (a slave), and there again, this is not tolerated for him, because it is a random sale. -Concerning a moukatab or a moudabbar that can be bought a slave, and having had relations with her, becomes pregnant and then gives birth, Malek said: “the child of each of them, will be in the same condition as his father, namely whether he is freed or a slave. Thus, if the slave is freed, the mother of his child will be part of property he owns (mudabbar or moukattab), and therefore, it will be delivered to him, in case he is freed”. Chapter II Posthumous emancipation set chapter. 
(1544) 2 - About a mudabbar who said to his master: "Hurry up and free me, and I will give you fifty dinars, paid on time, to which the master replied: "Yes, you are freed, on condition that you give me fifty dinars where you will pay me every year , ten dinars”, and that the mudabbar accepts, after which the master dies, two or three days after this agreement”, Malek said: “His postage is proven, the fifty dinars are a debt, his testimony is accepted, his person sacred, his inheritance is a right, he is subject to the prescribed penalties (just like a free man), however the death of his master will not cause him a remission of the debt". - Concerning a man who frees by title posthumously a slave, after which this man dies, while having left some money which is available to him, and some which is not, without that what is available may suffice for the freeing of the mudabbar slave, Malek said, "The mudabbar is made to keep his money within reach, and what it can bring him pending determination of the amount of the master's money which was not available to him. So if one-third of the total money is enough for the emancipation of the slave, this one will be freed and will even have his money, in case the third was not enough, and from this fact, he will be partially freed suitably to the third, by making him keep his own money- Chapter III From the will made during a posthumous emancipation. 
(1545) 3 - Malek said: “What is followed with us (at Medina) in any emancipation effected by a man, which he cites in a will which he himself has made in the state of health or sickness, it is that this man can retain you, or even change it, as long as this does not consist of a posthumous emancipation, because if it is such, he does not have the right to retain it. - Malek to add: "And all the children born of a slave, fit to be freed by a will, without having been a posthumous freedwoman, these children will not be freed, once she is freed, as long as her master can if he wishes or change her will, or that he retains her, without the emancipation of this slave being certain, moreover her situation is similar to that of a man saying to his (female) slave: if such a person stays with me, until my death, she will be free”. Thus, if this slave lives in the expected condition, she will be freed, although her master, if he wishes, he can sell her with his children, because these have not had the same favor that was granted to their mother." - Malek to continue: "And postage in a testament is quite different from posthumous emancipation, which the sunna has clearly distinguished. Moreover, if the two were the same, any testator will no longer have the right to vary his will and what is quoted therein from the emancipation, thus retaining the property of the slave without the latter being able to benefit from it. . - About a man, who, in full health, had freed all his slaves posthumously, without his owning any other property, Malek said: "If he had freed some of them, one before the other, we start with the postage of the first, then so on until one reaches the third of these slaves. And if he had them, while being ill, all set free, saying: “Such will be free, then such, then such another, at the same time, in case where my illness hastens my death" or that he had freed them all posthumously, once and for all, they will enjoy a third of his inheritance, without one having priority over the other, for the good reason that it is about a will, and that they have the third of the inheritance to distribute between them equitably, the third of these slaves will be freed some is the number; and none of them will have the priority, if the man had freed them, while being ill". - Concerning a man who had released a mudabbar, after which the man dies, without having any property other than the slave-mudabbar, who has money for him, Malek said: "one third of the slave will be freed, by making him keep his money within his reach". - About a mudabbar whose master had entered into a kitaba for him, after which the latter dies, leaving only the mudabbar in question as his property, Malek said: "the mudabbar will be freed one-third, one-third of his kitaba will be returned to him, and will have to pay the last two-thirds of the sum foreseen". - Eventually Malek said, "For a man, who everything while being ill, had freed his slave, half or even had completely freed him, and had done the same, posthumously for another slave, before falling ill, Malek emphasizes: one takes charge first of the moudabbar before the one who was freed in the state of his illness, because the man can neither go back on his postage, nor retain his slave for any reason. Thus, if the mudabbar is freed, one calculates the remainder of the third of the goods left by the death, for the benefit of the other slave, who has already been half freed, until he is completely freed. But if the remainder of the third is not sufficient for such emancipation, the slave will be proportionally emancipated according to this remainder, after having emancipated the first mudabbar”. Chapter IV Of the cohabitation of a man with his slave whom he had freed posthumously. 
(1546) 4 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar had made two of his female slaves mudabara (released posthumously) and he lived with them”. 
(1547) 5 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: “If the man posthumously frees his female slave, he can cohabit with her, without his having the right either to sell her or to give her away; her child also enjoys the same situation as her mother”. Chapter V On the subject of the sale of the mudabbar 
(1548) 6 - Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina), about the mudabbar is that its owner can neither sell it nor change its condition. In the event that the owner must a debt which he cannot manage to discharge, his creditors cannot sell him his mudabbar, as long as its possessor is still alive. But if the owner dies, without having a debt to pay, his mudabbar will profit from the third of the inheritance, being made that his possessor had enslaved him, as long as he was alive, and that the mudabbar did not had only to serve his master during his lifetime. Thus, this slave would be freed, without it being on behalf of the heirs, but rather of the whole inheritance, namely that he alone will have the third, and the heirs two-thirds. Now, if the possessor of the moudabbar dies, while leaving other property than the moudabbar, his third is to be freed, and his two-thirds will revert to the heirs. If the owner dies, having for debt what is worth the price of the mudabbar, one sells it to pay the debt, and the third of the mudabbar will be freed. On the other hand, if the debt is only suitable for half the price of the mudabbar, or sells this half to discharge the debt, then one frees the remaining third of the mudabbar, of the remaining value of the debt, namely, of the sixth”. - Malek also said, "It is not permitted, neither to sell the mudabbar nor anyone buy it, before this mudabbar has bought itself from its possessor, and this is permissible for him. He is the same with its possessor, and this is permitted to him. It is also tolerated that one gives money to the owner of the mudabbar, so that he is freed from it. And the right of patronage will always be granted to the master of the mudabbar”. - Malek to continue: "It is not allowed to sell the service of the mudabbar, because this is random, as long as he does not even know, until when his master will remain alive”. - As for the question of the slave, who, common to two men and where one of them freed his rightful share, posthumously, Malek said, “they must esteem the slave; thus if the one who had freed him bought him, the slave will be completely freed, otherwise, his liberation is invalid, except if the one who maintains his share of slavery, delivers him to his partner against a price, and then the one who had taken the initiative to free the slave, will totally free him posthumously. - Finally, about a Christian man, who had freed his slave, posthumously, after which the latter adopted Islam, Malek emphasizes: “The Christian is forbidden to enslave the slave, and he will be given a certain income in exchange; therefore the slave will not be sold until the decision is made by him in person. If the Christian dies, having a debt to pay, this will be subtracted from him from the price of the mudabbar, except if he had left property, which can cover the debt; thus, the mudabbar will be freed”. Chapter XI Injuries that the mudabbar causes to others. 
(1549) 7 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz judging about a mudabbar which caused an injury, said: "It is up to its possessor to deliver it to the injured person who will put it to work, or put him at his service, imposing on him compensation for his wounds. Thus, if the mudabbar manages to pay, before its possessor dies, he returns home”. - Malek said: “What is followed at home (at Medina) about the mudabbar which caused an injury, after which his master dies without his having any other property, than the mudabbar in question is that he will be freed from a third, then the compensation will be divided into three parts, and will be paid as follows: the first third will be calculated from the freed third of the slave, as for the other two thirds, they will revert to the heirs who, if they wish, will give the injured their share against what is due to them from the slave, namely two-thirds, or else, they will give him two-thirds of the compensation, thus retaining their share of the slave, because the compensation for this injury belonged to the slave, and is not a debt due to the master. Thus, what had been committed by the slave will not invalidate what the master had already done, such as liberation and posthumous emancipation. If the master of the slave had a debt owed to people, and the slave had committed a crime, we will sell from the mudabbar a share corresponding to the compensation for the injury, and the value of the debt; then we will debit by the payment of the compensation subtracting it from the price of the mudabbar, which will follow the payment of the debt of the master; finally we will calculate what remains of the price in order to free the third of the slave, leaving the other two-thirds, a share to the heirs. Moreover, we will act in this way, because the offense committed by the slave has priority over the debt of the master, given that if the latter had died, in leaving a moudabbar slave whose value is one hundred and fifty dinars, and that the latter had caused a serious injury to a man, worth compensation valued at fifty dinars, Malek explains thus: "We will pay, first of all the fifty dinars, by way of compensation, which are to be subtracted from the price of the slave, then the debt of the master will be paid, and we will finally calculate what rest of the price of the slave so that his third is freed, as for the other two thirds, they will be the share of the successors. Thus, the slave's compensation is much more indebted than the debt of his master, and the debt in turn is in relation to the posthumous emancipation which in fact, is only a will related to the third of the goods left by the deceased. Therefore, we do not tolerate anything from pothumous postage, as long as the master who intends to execute it, has a debt which he has not discharged, especially since the postage is a legacy, about which Allah bless and Most High said (meaning): "...After his legacies or debts have been paid..." (Koran IV, 11). - And Malek to continue: "If it is only the third of the property left by the dead is sufficient for complete freedom from the mudabbar, he will be freed, and the compensation he owes will be a debt to him which he will discharge after he has been freed, even if it is the blood money of a victim and his master will owe no debt”. About the mudabbar which hurts a man which leads his master to hand him over to the wounded, after which the master dies with a debt to pay, and he leaves only the moudabbar as his property; and the heirs say, "We deliver it to the injured," and he to whom the debt is owed protests, saying, "What is owed to me is higher," Malek said, "If the creditor is owed a sum which is more than the value of the slave, he will have the precedence to enslave the slave, and there will then be a remission of the debt which is suitable to what has been added to the sum. But if the creditor has advanced no addition, he will not possess the slave”. - Finally concerning the moudabbar which has property and causes injury to a man, and the master refuses to pay compensation, the injured person, Malek said, will take money from as compensation for his injury, if the amount is adequate to cover it; once he has had his right to compensation for his injury, he must return the slave to his master. If the amount is not suitable, the injured will recover it from the money possessed by the slave, and he will make him work until he has a full payment of his compensation. Chapter VII The oumm walad (mother (slave) of the child) who hurts another. 
(1550) 8 - Malek said: "In case an oumm walad injures someone it is his master who has the duty to pay compensation, unless what he will have to pay exceeds the price of his slave; in this case, he will only pay his price, as long as the master of the male or female slave, delivering one of them so that he pays the compensation, nothing more is imposed on him, if the compensation has a value greater than the price of the slave. If the master of the umm walad cannot deliver it, in accordance with the sunnah, if he pays a compensation corresponding to its value, it is as if he delivered it, and nothing more is imposed on it". And, said Malek, that's what I have heard better, and the master will not have to take responsibility for the crime of his slave, if his value exceeds his price”. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 41 The Book of Prescribed Punishments Chapter 1 Stoning 
(1551) 1 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported: “Jews went to the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) and told him that a Jew and a Jewess had committed adultery. The Envoy of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) asked them, "What do you find about stoning in your Torah?" And they answer: "To stigmatize them and flagellate them". Abdallah Ibn Salam answered them: “You are lying; for your Torah mentions stoning”. They brought the Torah, and opening it, one of them hid with his hand the verse where the stoning is mentioned, then he read what precedes it and what follows it. Abdallah then said to him, "Push your hand", and the other doing so, the verse of stoning was found. So the Jews said: “It is true, O Muhammad, this verse exists there”.

And the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered the stoning and we did the same. By him who holds my soul in his hand, if I was not afraid that people would say: "Umar added a verse to the Book of Allah", I would have dictated it, namely: "Stone the man to death. and the middle-aged woman", because this verse, we had recited it". - Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab reported: and Zul-Hijja did not end until Omar was killed, may Allah be merciful to him”. - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "We implied by the woman and the mature man, those who are married.

If you are going to whip him, I will confess to having committed adultery”; Now, when I said this to myself, I was embarrassed, and I wrote to Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz, who at that time was governor, telling him about this subject. Omar replied: “To forgive the father”. “I wrote, continue Zouraiq, again to Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz, saying to him: "What do you say about a man who has been defamed or whose father and mother have been defamed when both are dead or the one of them is alive” Omar answered me in writing: “If the one who is defamed forgives the other for his defamation, may his forgiveness be accepted; but for his relatives, dead, or one of them living, and who have been defamed, apply the penalty prescribed by the Book of Allah (namely eighty lashes), unless the defamed does not want to conceal himself”. - Malek said: “It is due to the fact that the defamed runs the risk of being as he has been accused, and that evident proofs are put forward on his subject.

Asking Omar, to advise her, on this subject, a man exclaimed: "He only gave praise to his father and mother". Others replied, "He could return them in another way, so we find that he must be scourged." So Omar applied to him the prescribed penalty of eighty lashes". - And Malek adds: “The penalty prescribed is not to apply only for an accusation of bastardy, or defamation or an insinuation the author of which intends by the latter only an accusation of bastardy or defamation; thus the prescribed penalty must certainly be applied to him”. - Eventually Malek said, “What is followed at us (in Medina), about a man accusing another of being a bastard, it is to have to apply the penalty to him even if the mother of the defamed was a slave”. Chapter VI Cases where the penalty is not applied (1570) - Malek said, "The best I've heard about a slave girl whom a man had cohabited, while he is partial owner of her, that he will not be subject to the prescribed penalty; however the child will be assigned to her, and the slave will be valued the day she became pregnant; thus, one will give his partners their share, and the slave will be his belonging. This is what is followed with us (in Medina)”. - Concerning the man who allows another to live with his slave, Malek said: "If he had intercourse with her, the price of this slave will be assessed, the very day he touched her, pregnant or not, and thus he escapes the prescribed penalty. However, if she is pregnant, the child will be attributed to the man”. - Malek finally said about the man who had cohabited with the slave of his son or daughter, that he will not have not to suffer the prescribed penalty; but the slave will be valued, pregnant or not, so that he pays his price”.

Amra continued and said, “Then the servant took the cloak, unstitched it and put in place of the green patch, wool and hair and then sewed it with new. Once the two freedwomen arrived in Medina, they returned the coat to its owner, who unstitching it, found wool and hair instead of green fabric. The two freedwomen were questioned about this, and they reported it in writing to Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and accused the servant. The latter questioned, confessed his crime, Aicha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered to cut off his hand and said: "We cut the hand of the thief, in case the price of the stolen object is a quarter of a dinar or more. - Malek said: “My favorite thing is that the hand is cut, in case the stolen object is of the price of three dirhams, even if the exchange price undergoes an increase or a decrease, therefore, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had ordered that the hand be cut off in case the shield is of a price of three dirhams. As for Osman Ibn Affan, he also demanded it for a citron whose price is three dirhams”. That's the best I've heard about it." Chapter VIII The cutting of the hand of the maroon slave and the thief

Thus, Abdallah Ibn Omar, ordered to bring the slave and cut off his hand”. 
(1578) 29 - Malek reported that Zuraiq Ibn Hakim told him that he retained a maroon slave, while stealing. He pursues: "being embarrassed about him, I write to Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz, to get his opinion, was he that time governor, telling him that I have heard that one does not have to cut off the hand of a maroon slave, if he steals. Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz, replied to me in writing, where he quotes his completely opposite opinion, saying: "You made me learn in writing, that you heard it said, not to have to cut off the hand of a maroon slave s 'he steals. However Allah Blessed and Most High has said in His Book (meaning): “Cut off the hand of the thief and the thief: it will be a retribution for what they have done and a punishment from Allah. Allah is mighty and just" (Qur'an Surah V, verse 38). Thus, if what is stolen by the maroon slave is of a price of a quarter of a dinar and more, to cut off his hand”. (...) 30 - It was reported to Malek that al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad, Salem Ibn Abdallah and Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair said: "If a maroon slave steals what deserves to have his hand cut off, cut it off." - And Malek to add: "such is what is indisputable following with us (in Medina), namely, that if what a maroon slave steals is of a price requiring his hand to be cut off, it is cut off”.

He replied with a yes, the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered to cut off his hand. So Safwan said to the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): “I did not want the matter to be such; this garment is an alms to him”.

(1581) 33 - Abdul Rahman Ibn Al Kassem reported according to his father that a man from Yemen arrived, having his hand and foot amputated, and went down to Abu Bakr Al Siddiq, and accused the governor of Yemen who judged him unjustly. This man spent the night praying when Abu Bakr said to himself: “By (the Lord) of your father, I find that a a man who spends the night like this is not a thief”. Later, if realizing that a necklace belonging to Asma Bint Oumaiss, wife of Abou Bakr Al Siddiq, was lost, the man with the family of Abou Bakr, began to seek him, saying: “Great Allah! It's up to you to punish the one who came rob this virtuous house (implying that of Abu Bakr)”. The necklace was found at a jeweler who admitted that the amputee had sold it to him. The amputated man confessed his theft, or even testimony was brought against him. So Abu Bakr ordered his left hand to be cut off, saying, “By Allah! his invocation against himself was to me more painful than his flight. - Malek said: “What is followed in Medina about of the one who does not stop stealing and against whom one asks for help, what one has only to cut off his hand, for all that he had stolen, if one had not yet applied the prescribed penalty. Now, if this sentence has been applied, and then he steals what requires that his hand be cut off, we must do it again for another member”. 
(1582) 34 - Malek reported that Abu Al Zinad told him told that a prefect of Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz had retained men, without them having killed anyone (but for stealing). He wanted or cut off their hands or kill them; so he learned this in writing from Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz who answered him: "You will have to choose the lightest sentence to punish them". - Malek said: “what is followed at home (at Medina) about the one who steals what people have displayed in the market, and whose owners have well kept and collected objects, one must cut off his hand if the stolen object is of a price which requires that the cut be made and whether it is done day or night, whether the owner is present with his objects or not". - About the one who steals what demands cutting of the hand, then that one finds on him the stolen object, and that one returns it to its owner, one always cuts off his hand" says Malek and continuing, he says: "If one disputes that in saying: “How to cut off his hand, and the stolen object has already been returned to its owner? “In fact, his case is like that of a drunkard who smells of wine without being drunk with it; thus one subjects it to the prescribed sorrow, answered Malek”. Thus, therefore, the drunkard is subject to the prescribed penalty who even if he drinks without becoming drunk, because he drank it only to be drunk. Likewise, the thief's hand is cut off for the object he has stolen even if he has not used it, and that it be returned to its owner; thus, the steering wheel, it intended to keep it. - Concerning the group of people who enter a house and steal it, then all go out, carrying together what they have found, namely, either a crate, or a stretcher, or a basket or the like, which they bring out of their place where they are kept, and that the price of the stolen object requires submission to the prescribed penalty, because it is three dirhams, their hands must be cut off”. If each of them comes out with an object on him whose price is three dirhams or more, his hand will be cut off. As for the one, who steals an object of less than three dirhams, he will not have his hand cut off”. - And Malek to continue: “What is followed at us (in Medina) in case a man has a house where he lives alone, and it is closed, it is because we do not cut off the hand of the thief if he steals anything from this house until after he has taken it out. Corn in case the house has several inhabitants, and each one closes his own door, the thief who steals something from this house, by taking it out, will have his hand cut off, because he has caused it to be moved from a guarded place to another who is also guarded; so we have to cut off his hand”. - Malek to continue: “What is followed at home (at Medina), when a slave steals his master's belongings, and he is neither one of his servants nor one of those entrusted to guard the dwelling, but who in secret has stolen what requires, cut off his hand, or don't cut it off. It is the same for a slave, who steals the effects of her master: "As for the slave, who is neither servants, nor of those to whom one has entrusted to keep the house, and who steals the effects of his master's wife, which requires cutting off his hand, cutting off his hand". Similarly if it is the slave of a wife, in case she is neither one of her servants, nor one of her husband, nor yet of those to whom the house has been entrusted, and she enters clandestinely, stealing the effects of the wife of his master, his hand is not cut off if the stolen object is of a value requiring that be done”. Such is also the case of the slave of a woman who is not one of her servants nor of those to whom the residence is entrusted, who enters clandestinely and steals her mistress's effects, the value of which requires cutting, one does not don't cut off his hand." - Malek to add: the same for the man who steals the belongings of his wife, or that the wife steals the belongings of her husband, which requires their hands to be cut off, in case each of them has stolen the belongings of the other, from a house which is other than the one where they live, their hand is cut off if the stolen object is of a value that requires it to be done". - Malek to say again: "In case we steal, at a small child and mute, their effects, or what is in their houses, they cut off the hand of the one who committed the theft. But if the child and the mute are outside their house, and they are stolen, one does not cut off the hand of the one who stole them. Besides, their case is similar to that of the fruits which are still on the tree or even of the herds lost in the mountains”. - Malek finally said, "What is followed at Medina, about the one who digs up the corpses, is to cut off his hand in case the stolen object is of a value requiring this penalty”. Because, explains Malek: "The tomb is a sacred place just like the house, and where the penalty is only applied once the digger has brought out stolen objects from the tomb". Chapter XI Which does not require the cutting of the hand. 
(1583) 35 - Muhammad Ibn Yahia Ibn Habban reported that a slave stole a small palm tree from a garden belonging to a man, and planted it in his master's garden. The owner of this palm went out looking for his palm; the finding, he accused the slave to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam who put him in prison, also wanting to cut off his hand. Immediately the master of the slave went in search of Rafé Ibn Khadij; asked him about it, he said that he heard the Apostle of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say: "One does not cut off the hand of him who steals fruit from the tree, nor plans of palm tree". So the man said to Rafé: “Marwan Ibn Al Hakkam has retained one of my slaves and intends to cut off his hand; I want you to come with me to tell him what you heard from the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah). Rafé accompanies him to Marwan and asks him "Have you retained a slave who belongs to this man"? - "Yes, answered Marwan"; Rafé went on: "What do you want to do with him"? “Cut off his hand”; Rafe cried, "I heard the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say: "One does not cut off the hand of the one who steals fruit from the tree, nor palm tree plans". Marwan thus ordered that the man be released. slave".

Omar then said, “Leave him; he do not apply the cut to it, because your slave has stolen an object from your effects”. 
(1585) 37 - Ibn Chehab reported that Marwan Ibn Al Hakkam received a man who had stolen effects. Wanting to cut off his hand, he sent someone to Zaid Ibn Thabet to question him about it. Zaid Ibn Thabet replied, "A stolen object does not require the hand to be severed."

Abu Bakr continued: “She came to my house, while I was among the men, and said to me: “Your maternal aunt Amra reports to you the following: “son of my sister! I was informed that you detained a Nabataean for stealing something of little value, and you intended to cut him off. the hand"? - "Yes, I answered". “Amra, continue the slave - says to you: "One does not cut off the thief's hand only to have stolen an object whose price is a quarter of a dinar or more”. Abu Bakr then said, "I have freed the Nabataean." - Malek said: “what is followed with us in Medina concerning the confession of slaves, in case one of them confesses his offence, it is that he is to submit to the prescribed penalty and to the corporal sanction. For his confession is tolerated to him, and one does not not accuse him of having personally compromised himself to this sentence". “But, continues Malek, if one of them confesses his offense in such a way that the indemnity goes to his master, we cannot tolerate that his confession harms his master”. - Malek further said, “If an employee or other put in the service of people steal, the penalty is not applied to them, because their case is not that of a thief, but rather of a traitor and the traitor is not subject to the cutting of the hand”. - Also Malek said, "he who borrows 'an aria' (namely an object that is used and then returned) and that he denies it, will not have his hand cut off. For his case is like one who owes a debt to another and he denies it; but the denial does not require the cut”. - Malek to add: "What is followed in Medina, in about a thief who is in a house, where he has assembled the effects, but where he has not yet left, it is because he is not subject to the penalty of the cut . For his case is like that of a man who had wine to drink in his hand; but not having drunk it, he is not subject to the prescribed penalty. Also, his case is similar to that of a man who finds himself seated with a woman, and who wishes to cohabit her in an illicit manner; however, not having done so, he is not subject to the prescribed penalty. - Finally Malek said: “what is followed at Medina is that stealing by stealth does not require the cutting of the hand, whether or not the stolen object is of a value that requires it”.

But being such, Omar whipped him." 
(1588) 2 - Thawr Ibn Zaid al-Daili reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab consulted men about who drinks wine (wanting to know what punishment to prescribe).

Thus Omar applied the penalty of eighty lashes to the wine drinker. 
(1589) 3 - Malek reported that Ibn was asked Chehab on the prescribed penalty to which a slave is subjected, drinking wine.

"No," replied the man. Another man sitting next to him whispers to him in secret. The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) asked him, "What did you whisper to him?" To sell it, said the man. So the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) said to him: "He who forbade that it be drunk, also prohibited it for sale".

So they put it to boil, until two-thirds had evaporated, leaving only one-third, which they brought to Omar. He dipped a finger in it, then withdrew his hand, the liquid expanded. Omar said, "It's like the preparation with which camels are coated", and he ordered them to drink it. Then Oubada Ibn Al-Samett said to him: “By Allah! You have made it lawful”! And Omar to resume: “No, by Allah! God is great! I will not give them back never lawful what You have forbidden, nor will I forbid them what You have made lawful. (...) 15 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that men of Iraq said to him: "O Abu Abdul-Rahman, we bought ourselves dates and grapes, then we made wine from them and we sold it".

Chapter II The practice of blood money 
(1602) 2 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab evaluated for the inhabitants of the villages, the price of blood at one thousand dinars in gold, or at twelve thousand dirhams in silver, and that, according to the current fund”. - Malek, explaining this says: “The current fund in Syria and Egypt is gold; and in Iraq, it's the money”. (...) 3 - Malek has heard that the blood money is to be paid over the course of three or four years. - And Malek to continue: “And it is preferable to me that he be paid over the course of three years”. - Eventually Malek said, “What is followed at we (in Medina) are not to admit inhabitants of the villages, as blood money, camels; nor Bedouins, gold or silver; nor of those who possess gold, silver and vice versa”. (1) Note that this expression will be, throughout of this chapter, taken to mean "murder"; as to the term "dyia", a word of Arabic origin, it will be taken in the sense of "legal compensation" paid as compensation for an offense committed. Chapter III The price of blood paid for a willful crime and of a crime committed by a madman. 
(1603) 4 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab said: "if the price of blood paid for a premeditated crime is admitted, it is twenty-five camels of one year of age, twenty-five camels of two years of age, twenty-five camels of three years of age , and twenty-five camels of four years of age”. 
(1604) 5 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Marwan Ibn Al-Hakkam wrote to Mu'awia Ibn Abi Sufian, asking his opinion about a mad man who killed another. Mou'awia answered him in writing: "impose the price of blood on him without killing him, because one does not submit a madman with the prescribed penalty”. - Malek said: “About two men, one of whom one adult and the other youngest, and who together premeditatedly kill a man, it is up to the adult to be killed, and to the youngest to pay half the price of blood. - Eventually Malek said, "The same goes for the case where two men, one free and the other a slave, together kill a slave; it is the slave who will be killed, as for the free man, he will have to pay half the price of blood». Chapter IV Blood money paid for an unintentional crime. 
(1605) 6 - 'Iraq Ibn Malek and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that a man from Bani Sa'd Ibn Laith, was racing a horse, which crushed the finger of a man from Jouhaina, who had a bleeding, and ended up dying. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said to the defendants: "Do you swear for fifty times in the name of Allah, that the man did not die because of this injury"? They refused and prevented themselves from doing this, and on his part Omar addressing the others, asking them also, to swear, and they refused, he demanded that the first to know supporters of Sa'd, pay half the blood money to the victim”. - Malek said, "this was not followed at home (in Medina)". (...) 7 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab, Suleiman Ibn Yassar and Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdul Rahman, said: "The price of blood for an unintentional crime is twenty camels one year old, twenty camels two years old, twenty camels two years old, twenty camels three years of age, and twenty camels of four years of age”. - Malek also said: “what is followed at home (at Medina), is not to subject young adolescents to the prescribed punishment, even if they have voluntarily committed a crime, unless they are pubescent. Thus, a homicide committed by a boy is not considered intentional, since, if a boy and an adult man both unintentionally knocked out a free man, it falls to the "a'quila" of each of them. , to pay half the blood money”. (1) "la a'qila" constitutes the set of united males by the legitimate family tie, namely "agnate", inheriting the dead who can be either the father, or the uncle, or the brother, or the grandfather.... - Malek finally said, "Whoever knocks unwillingly, he will pay blood money without being subject to corporal punishment, for the price in question paid for the victim is just like what property he has from what he can pay of a debt or even to make a bequest. Thus, if he has property, the blood money to be paid will be a third of it, and thus he is exempt from the diya, although this is tolerated for him. And if he has no property, except what is blood money, also this is tolerated for him to take the third to make it a legacy and an exemption if the victim's parents forgive him. Chapter V Blood money suitable for injuries caused unintentionally; 
(1606) 8 - Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina), concerning wounds caused involuntarily, it is that blood money is not to be paid until the injured person has healed. Again, if it's a broken hand or foot or whatever member of the body of the man, involuntarily caused, then that it is cured, returning to its initial state, there is not a price to be paid, but if this wound has caused a deformation or an ugliness, the price of the blood which is to be poured must be proportional to what has been deformed and ugly”. - And Malek to continue: "If it is a question of a fracture of the bones, of which the Prophet r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) had specified the price of blood which is suitable for him, it must be in conformity with the prescriptions of the Prophet; but if it is that the Prophet (on him the grace and the peace of Allah) did not specify the price of blood, and that there is on this subject neither a sunnah nor a fixed price , we are trying to give a suitable sentence”. - Malek also said: "the scars caused by error, to the body involuntarily, do not require blood money, if the scar becomes healthy, returning to its original state. But, if the citratrice leaves a deformation or an ugliness, one considers what is suitable for him as diya, except if it is about a “jaifa”, which requires that the dyia be the third of that of a murder. There is not either, continues Malek, a dyia for the case of a “mounakkila”^ which is just like “the moudiha”^. - Malek finally said, “What is tracked at us (in Medina), in case a doctor in circumcising has the glans of the penis cut off, it is because this imposes a dyia on him. And this is one of the errors that la'aqila must assume in his responsibilities. It is the same for any error committed by a doctor, or that he goes beyond his duties, without his wanting it; if so, the dyia is due". Chapter VI The price of woman's blood. 
(1607) 9 - Yahia ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: "The price of a woman's blood is a third of that of a man, but the dyia is the same whether it is an amputated finger or a broken tooth, or even the same so-called injuries. moudiha and mounakkila”. (...) 10 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab and Ourwa Ibn al Zoubair said similarly to Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab about the price of a woman's blood, namely that it is one third of that of a man. And if this price already reaches the third, the dyia will be of the half that of a man'. Interpreting this, Malek said, “So for the wounds called the “moudiha” and the “mounakkila”, the dyia is the same as that of man; but as for the "jaifa" and the "ma'mouma", and other similar injuries, subject to a third of the price of blood, the dyia of the woman will be half that of the man". (...) 11 - Malek reported that he heard Ibn Shehab say: "It is from the sunnah that a man causing an injury to his wife, that he pays her the dyia suitable for this injury, without him be subject to the prescribed penalty”. - Malek also said: "Now it is such in case this injury is involuntarily caused by the man, by hitting his wife with a whip and gouging out her eye, for example”. (1) “jaifa”: it is a wound reaching the inside of the body. (2) “mounakkila”: an injury with dislocation. (3) “moudiha”: an injury without a fracture. (4) "la m'amouma": it is a fracture in the head reaching the skull. - Malek finally said, “Regarding the woman who has a husband and children who are neither of her "acebs" nor of her people, her husband, especially if he is of another tribe, will not have to pay blood money in the event of an offense, nor with regard to this woman, nor with regard to his children who are not of his own tribe, nor even with regard to his uterine brothers who are neither of his "acebs" nor of his people, for such have a right to the inheritance of this woman. As for relatives, they had, and in the time of the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), to pay the price of blood, until our days. It is the same for the freedmen of the woman whose inheritance goes to the children of the woman even if they are not of her tribe. And the price of the blood of a crime unwittingly committed by the freedmen, will have to be paid by the tribe of the woman”. (2) "aceb": is the male who inherits from a dead person, the remainder of the inheritance, after the reserveees have had their share; or who inherits everything if there are no reservers. Chapter VII Fetal blood money. 
(1608) 12 - Abu Huraira reported that two women of the Hazil tribe, quarreled, during which one caused the other, who was pregnant, to lose her child. Thus, the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) demanded, "The ghourra” (as compensation) who is either a slave”. 
(1609) 13 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab said: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) demanded, concerning the child killed in the bosom of his mother, "the ghourra" as lawful compensation and who is a slave. The man who owed this compensation, a Protestant said, "How shall I pay the price of a being who has yet drunk, neither eaten, nor articulates, nor speaks; thus such a requirement is invalid”. However, the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: "This man is a fellow magician". (...) 14 - Malek reported that Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman said: “The ghourra is valued at fifty dinars or six hundred dirhams; and the dyia of a free Muslim woman is five hundred dinars or even six thousand dirhams”. - Malek said, "The lawful compensation of a child killed in the bosom of his mother, a free woman, is equivalent to the tenth of his dyia; and the tenth is fifty dinars or six hundred dirhams”. - And Malek to continue: "I didn't hear anyone to say that for a child killed in the bosom of its mother, one should only pay a ghourra until the moment when its mother has aborted it or until it falls dead”. - “And always, on this subject, Malek said: “I have heard that if the child comes out of the lap of its mother alive and then dies, there again we demand full compensation”. - “Also Malek adds: “A child is only considered alive when he comes out of his mother's lap. Thus, if he leaves there and dies afterwards, the compensation is due. I also believe that the compensation for a child of a slave is a tenth of the price of his mother". - Finally Malek said: "if a pregnant woman kills a man or a woman involuntarily, she will not be subjected to the prescribed penalty until she has given birth to her fetus. If a pregnant woman is intentionally or unintentionally killed, whoever killed her killed will have nothing to pay Tegaruee her fetus. But if she is voluntarily killed, one kills the one who killed her, without his having to pay compensation with regard to her fetus. price of the mother's blood, independently of her foetus. (...) 15 - Malek was asked about the child of a Jewish or Christian woman, if he is aborted, he replied: "I think we should pay him a tenth of the price of his mother's blood". Chapter VIII Which is subject to full dyia. 
(1610) 16 - Ibn Chehab reported that Sa'id Al Moussaiab said: “For the two cut lips, one owes a complete dyia; but if it is only the lower lip, the dyia is two-thirds”. (...) 17 - Malek reported that he asked Ibn Chehab about the one-eyed man gouging out the eye of a healthy man? Ibn Chehab answered: “If the healthy desires that the punishment be applied to the one-eyed, this is his right; or else it may have a dyia of thousand dinars or twelve thousand dirhams”. (...) 18 - It was reported to Malek that for each lost pair of a man's limbs requires a complete dyia; so is the tongue, both ears with deafness, whether even cut off or not; also a full dyia is needed for the man's penis and both testicles» (...) 19 - It was again reported to Malek, that the dyia must be complete for both breasts cut off from a woman”. - Malek, on the other hand, said, “I think there is not a dyia about the cut eyebrows, nor about the man's chest either”. - Eventually Malek said, “What is followed at us (in Medina) is to give the man a full dyia in case he has lost much more than a limb. Also, if it is his hands, his feet and his eyes which are affected, knowing that he is broken and punctured, he has right to three dyia'. “As for the healthy eye of a one-eyed man, who by mistake is punctured, he will be entitled to a complete dyia”. Chapter IX The dyia poured about the eye losing sight 
(1611) 20 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that Zaid Ibn Thabet said: “For a healthy eye that has lost sight, you need a dyia of one hundred dinars”. - Malek was asked about the loss of the lower lid of the eye, and fracture of its socket; he answered: "one does not fail to find a suitable sentence, except if this harms the sight of the eye, then one considers what is harmful". - Eventually Malek said, “What is followed at us (in Medina), about a blind eye, if it is torn out, and likewise about a paralyzed hand which is cut off. there be a definite dyia about it. Chapter X The dyia corresponding to the wounds 
(1612) 21 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id heard Soulaiman Ibn Yassar say: "the moudiha" to the face is treated similarly to that which is made to the head, except if it makes the face ugly; so so, one adds his dyia, taking into account the difference between this one, and half of the dyia corresponding to the head and it will be seventy-five dinars. - Malek said: “what is followed in Medina about of the "mounakkila" is to give fifteen camels as a dyia. "The mounakkila", continues Malek, is the wound which causes the fine bones of the head to be lost without reaching the brain; she may as well be the head than in the face". - Malek to also say: "what is followed in Medina, about the "maamouma" and the "Jaifa", it is that they do not impose the prescribed sentence on me". And Ibn Chehab said: "the maamouma does not require pain". - And Malek interpreting said: "the maamouma is a fracture penetrating the bones of the skull; and it is only considered as such”. - Eventually Malek said, "What is followed at Medina is that there is no need to pay a dyia for a wound that is less than the moudiha; in fact the dyia is for what is the mudiha and a greater wound, because the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had underlined it in his letter sent to Amr Ibn Hazm, where he made it correspond to five camels. Moreover, the imams of the past and of today have not demanded anything like dyia about the moudiha”. (...) 22 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: “Any deep wound practiced in one of the limbs, requires a dyia equivalent to one third of that of that limb'. (...) 23 - Malek said: "Ibn Chehab was not of the notice (quoted above); as for me, I did not find that we agreed on the subject of the deep wound practiced in one of the members, but rather it is up to the imam to find a suitable sentence”. - Also Malek said, "What is applied in Medina, it is to consider a wound as a maamouma or mounakkila or even moudiha, only if it is in the face or in the head. But any other injury made in any part of the body, calls only for a sentence”. - Eventually Malek said, "I don't conceive, for as for the lower jaw and the nose, to consider them as part of the head, so long as they are separated from it, and the head is his, one bone”. (...) 24 - Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman reported that Abdallah Ibn Al Zoubair had applied the law of retaliation to a man who caused the mounakkila”. Chapter XI The dyia corresponding to the fingers. 
(1613) 25 - Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman reported: “I asked Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab about the dyia for a woman's finger being cut off? He answered me: “It is ten camels” “And for two fingers, I resumed”? “Twenty camels, he replied” “And for three”? - "Thirty Camels"; “and for four”? - “twenty camels”. So I asked him: “How is it that the more serious the injury, the more the dyia decreases”? Sa'id replied, “Are you Iraqi? - "Actually a scholar with a fine mind, or an ignoramus to learn, I replied". Sa'id to reply, "Rather, he is of the Sunnah, O son of my brother." (1) Iraqi: designates the one who applies the reasoning by Syllogism. - Malek also said, "what is followed in Medina, it is to demand the dyia in case the finger of one hand is cut off. If it is the five cut off, their dyia will be that of a complete hand, namely fifty camels, starting with ten camels for each finger”. - Finally Malek said: "for the phalanxes of the hand, the required dyia is thirty-three dinars, and a third for each of them, thus corresponding to three camels and a third of a camel”. Chapter XII The dyia relating to the teeth. 
(1614) 26 - Aslam, the freedman of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab reported that Umar demanded that the dyia of one tooth be a camel, as well as for the collarbone and the rib”. I (...) 27 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab say: “Omar Ibn Khattab demanded that the dyia of it be, for every tooth pulled out, a camel; and Mou'awia (on his part, let the dyia be five camels for every tooth pulled out". - Sa'id, continued, and said: "So therefore the dyia is decreasing according to Omar, and increasing according to Mou'awia. As for me, if I had to make up my mind, I would have imposed two camels for each tooth pulled out, finding that such a dyia is so suitable, and every jurist will be rewarded for it”. (...) 28 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: “in case the tooth is affected and therefore blackens, the dyia is payable. And if, after getting dark. it is uprooted, the dyia will have to be paid, in full”. [ Chapter XIII The application of the dyia of the teeth. 
(1615) 29 - Abu Ghatafan Ibn Tarif Al-Mourri a reported that Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam sent him, to ask Abdallah Ibn Al-Abas, about the unintentional pulling out of a tooth”? Abdallah Ibn AI Abbas replied: “The dyia paid is five camels”. Marwan me instructed to be again at Abdallah Ibn Abbas asking him “Do you consider molars as incisors”?. And Abdallah Ibn Abbas to answer: “don't the fingers of a hand require the same dyia”? (...) 30 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father did not distinguish between the teeth, when it is about the dyia». * Malek said: “What is followed at home (at Medina) is that the dyia is the same for all teeth at once, is it the inolar ones or the incisors, the fact that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "for a tooth-involuntarily pulled out - the dyia is five camels, and the molar is nothing but one tooth among others, where they cannot be distinguished from each other”. Chapter XIV The dyia paid for the injury caused to a slave. 
(1616) 31 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar said: "the moudiha of the slave demands a dyia worth half of the tenth of its price". (...) 32 - It was also reported to Malek that Marwan Ibn Al Hakkam decided about the slave who was injured, that it is the duty of the one who injured, to give the payment of a dyia equivalent to what is the reduction of the price of the slave”. * Malek said: “What is followed at home (at Medina), is that the dyia paid for the injury caused to a slave, depends on the nature of the latter, just like what follows: * for the moudiha, a dyia worth the tenth of half the price of the slave. * for the mounakkila, it is a tenth and half a tenth. * for the maamouma and the jaifa: each is a third of its price. As for the other wounds, viz. everything that can reduce the price of the slave, one estimates, after the recovery of the slave, how much is the difference, between the value of the price of the slave after his wound, and his value before he did not undergo it. Then one asks to the author of the wound the payment of a dyia equivalent to the difference of the two prices”. - Also, about the slave whose hand or the foot were fractured, after which the limb healed, Malek said: "In fact, the one who caused this fracture, will have nothing to pay, unless this fracture causes the reduction of the price of the slave, or his dislocation then thus, the dyia to pay will be equivalent to the reduction of the price ". - And Malek to continue: “what is followed in Medina, it is that the law of retaliation is applied to slaves as well as to free men, namely: a slave can be killed for a slave, their wounds are still the same. Also, if a slave voluntarily kills another slave, the master of the latter will have to choose: either that he applies the law of retaliation to the slave, or that he has to recover the dyia, equivalent to the price of his killed slave. On the other hand, if the master of the homicidal slave wants to pay the price of the killed slave, he will be able to do so, or he will deliver his slave to the master of the murderer slave and again the other master having already the murderous slave, will not have to kill him. Such is the rule followed between slaves even in the case of a hand or a foot. cut or other punishment such as murder which is also subject to the law of retaliation". - Malek finally said about the slave Muslim, wounding a Jew or a Christian, that the master of this slave can pay him the dyia for his doing, or even that he delivers him for to be sold. Being such, one gives to the Jew or to the Christian, a dyia coming from the price of the slave, or still all the price so that the dyia is paid; but neither a Jew nor a Christian will be handed over a Muslim slave”. Chapter XV The dyia of the People of the Book. 
(1617) 33 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz has decided, in case a Jew or a Christian is killed, that Sa dyia of each, be equivalent to half that of a free Muslim man", - Malek said: “What is followed at home (at Medina), is not to kill a Muslim because of a disbeliever, unless the Muslim kills the other by treason; consequently he shall be subject to execution". (...) 34 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Soulaiman Ibn Yassar said: “The dyia of a “majous” (one of the magi) is eight hundred dirhams”. And Malek to underline: “This is also what is followed with us (in Medina)”. - Finally Malek said: “The wounds caused to the Jews, Christians, and Magi have a relatively small dyia compared to the wounds of Muslims, which is as follows: For the moudiha, it is half of a tenth of the dyia (of Muslims); for the maamouma and the jaifa: each is a third party, and so it is with all their wounds”. Chapter XVI That which is subject to the dyia of a man's property. 
(1618) 35 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported from his father, that he said: "The aqila is not subject to the payment of the price of the blood, when it is a crime voluntarily committed; but this price is to be paid, if the crime is involuntary”. (...) 36 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab said: “It is Sunnah no longer to require the aquila to pay the blood money for a voluntary crime unless she wants to do so”. (...) 37 - Malek added, that Yahia Ibn Sa'id was of the same opinion (quoted above). -And Malek to continue that Ibn Chehab said: "It is of the sunnah, in the case where it is a voluntary murder, and where the parents of the victim have withdrawn, that the dyia be paid from the own property of the murderer, unless the aqila intends to support him to acquit of his own free will”. - Malek also said, "what is followed in Medina, it is that the dyia is not obliged to pay it, except in the case where the dyia is a third party and beyond; being such, it is required to the aqila; if it is less than one-third, the dyia is paid from the author's own money”. - Malek added: “What is unquestionably follow-up in Medina about who, one accepts the payment of a dyia, for having committed a voluntary murder or even for an injury caused voluntarily, and where the relatives of the victim had accepted the dyia, is that nothing is required of the aqila unless it does so willingly; for in fact the price of blood, is to be paid from the own money of the murderer or of the one who caused the wound, if he possesses the money; otherwise, this remains a debt, from which he will have to discharge; therefore, the aqila will not have to pay anything unless she wishes”. - Malek further said, "Nothing is required of the aqila, in case a man kills or injures himself voluntarily or involuntarily; moreover, such is the opinion of men versed in religion on this subject. And I have never heard anyone say that the aqila must guarantee the dyia of a voluntary crime. This is known to by the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in His Book (meaning): "One should use proper procedures towards the one to whom his brother has forgiven part of the debt, and he himself will compensate him in the best way (Koran II, 178). This is interpreted as follows, and Allah is most knowledgeable: "Whoever takes part of his brother's dyia, let him follow him with a suitable deed, and let the doer kindly compensate him." - “Regarding the boy or woman, committing a package whose dyia is not more than a third of the blood money, and both of them do not have the money they need, Malek said: "In fact, it must be guaranteed from their own property, d where we take the sum; but if neither of them has the money, the blood money will be a debt they will have to pay, without the aqila having anything to do with it. On the other hand, the father of the boy will not have to pay what is the duty of this boy”. - Eventually Malek said, "What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), about the slave killed is that his dyia is to be assessed on the day of his murder. As for the aqila of the murderer, it will owe nothing of this dyia of some value, namely less or more. Because it's up to the murderer what does it mean to compensate with one's own money as much as the dyia will be. On the other hand, if the price of the slave is equivalent to the dyia whether it is superior or inferior to it, it will be taken from the money of the murderer, as long as the slave is considered as a commodity among others”. Chapter XVII The legacy of the dyia and its execution. 
(1619) 38 - Ibn Chehab reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, addressed, while he was in Mina, the people saying: “Whoever has knowledge about the dyia, let him teach it to me”. Al-Dahhak Ibn Sufian arose and said: "The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) prompted me in writing to do to inherit Achiam al-Dibabi's wife her share of her husband's dyia'. Omar said to him: "Enter your tent and await my arrival". As soon as Omar showed up, Al-Dahhak teaches him what is the subject of the dyia; from then on, Omar decided on the business of the dyia. - And Ibn Chehab added: "The murder of Achiam was accomplished involuntarily". 
(1620) 39 - Amr Ibn Chou'aib reported that a man of Bani Moudiej known as Katada, throwing his sword at his son, hit him in the leg, after which, the son died because of of a hemorrhage. Suraqa Ibn Jou'choum, went to Omar Ibn Al Khattab, told him the incident, Omar, also said to him: "go to “Qadid”, count one hundred and twenty camels and wait for me to arrive”. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab arrived at the destined place, took camels counted, thirty camels of three years old, thirty camels of four years old and thirty more full, then said: “where is the brother of the knocked down”? "Here I am," he replied. "Take them", continued Omar, because the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “a homicide has no right to dyia”. (...) 40 - Malek reported that Sa'id Al Moussaiab and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar were asked, if the dyia was at increase, if it falls during a holy month? "No," they replied, but she undergoes an addition out of consideration to this month." Then Sa'id was asked: "Should the dyia corresponding to wounds be increased, just like that which is increased for murder"? "Yes," he said. - Malek added: “I see that they have, on this subject, acted, just as Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had judged the case of the dyia of Moudlaji, throwing his sword and wounding his son”. 
(1621) 41 - Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair reported that a Ansai man known as Ouhaiha Ibn Al-Joulah had an uncle who was shorter than him, living with his maternal uncles; Ouhaiha took him and killed him; thus the maternal uncles exclaimed: "we brought him up from his tender age, and when he grew into a strong man, a paternal nephew took him away from us." Ourwa then said: “it is for such a reason that a murderer does not inherit from his victim”. - Malek said: “What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), it is that the murderer who kills with all his will inherits nothing from the dyia of the victim, nor from his goods. Also, this murderer cannot prevent any reservator from receiving his share of the estate. And he who involuntarily kills, inherits nothing more dyia. However, regarding his right to inheritance, this has been subject to discussion, as long as he is not accused of having killed, to inherit the victim, nor to seize his property. So what I find good is that he will have to inherit his property, regardless of his dyia”. Chapter XVIII The dyia in general. 
(1622) 42 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "No more dyia to put back in case of an accident from animal, well and metal. As for what is “rikaz” (it is what is buried treasures in pre-Islamic times) we count the fifth”. - Malek, on this subject, is of the same opinion. - Malek said, "The leader of a caravan, the driver of a beast and its rider, all are responsible for wounds caused by a mount, except the case where the beast kicks without being pushed by someone who makes him do so. On the other hand, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, was for the payment of the dyia concerning the one who makes his mount run (ie thereby causing him an injury). - Malek added: “Besides the leader of a caravan, the driver of an animal and the one who rides it owe the payment of a dyia much more than the one who drives his mount”. - Malek further said, "What is practiced in Medina, is the following: “Whoever digs a well in the middle of the street, or ties up a mount or even does such a thing on the path traveled by the Muslims, and all these actions are what is not not allowed, and what causes harm to Muslims, he will be held responsible for what may happen, injury either she or otherwise. If the damage caused does not count even a third of the dyia, it will be taken from that man's own money; but if the sum is one-third or more, it is aqila. However, if the man had done what is permitted as an action, and this had caused damage or harm to the Muslims, he will not be responsible for it, such as digging a well to retain rain water. or get off a mount and tie it up beside the road, to satisfy a need”. - Also, about one who descends into a well, and another follows it, so that the first attracts the second, both ending up in the well, Malek said: "It's up to the first to pay the dyia". - The same for the boy, whom the man asks to descend into a well, or to climb a palm tree, and who ends up to die (by falling or other cause related to this order), Malek said: "It is up to the man to take the responsibility, thus paying the dyia". - Malek said again: “What is incontestably practiced among us (in Medina), it is to demand from women and boys the payment of the dyia with raqua, because in fact the dyia is only payable by men who are already mature”. -About the dyia required of freedmen Malek a said: "We can charge the aquila with it if she accepts, but in case she refuses they will belong to Diwan (1), or be abandoned. Also from the time of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and Abu Bakr Al Siddiq, the aqila regime was followed even before the diwan existed; therefore this diwan was instituted in the time of Umar. Therefore, it is not permissible for someone to be paid the dyia if they are not people of his tribe or his relatives, because the wala cannot be transmitted, although the Messenger of Allah r (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) On him the grace and peace of Allah said: "the right of patronage (in other words the wala) belongs to the one who frees". (1) The Diwan is designed as being the registry. But during the time of Omar Ibn el Khattab the Diwan consisted of governmental and official institutions such the public treasury the personal status and other… - And Malek to emphasize the wala is a fixed membership” - - Also, what is followed with us (in Medina) concerning beasts that have suffered harm; Malek said, "Whoever has caused harm to them, must pay for them a sum equivalent to the rate of diminution." - Concerning the man condemned to death, by committing a crime that subjects him to a prescribed sentence, Malek said: "The prescribed sentence is no longer taken into account, as long as death encompasses everything, except if it is the case of defamation, so one asks the defamed : "Why don't you ask for the application of the penalty to the one who defamed you"? And Malek to underline: “I conceive there, the application of the prescribed penalty to the defamer before killing him. Then we will kill him, I do not understand that we have the right to impose the payment of the dyia on him if it is an injury for example, because the death penalty does not leaves room for no other pain”. - Malek said again: “What is followed at home (at Medina), about a man killed, abandoned among the dwellings or in a village or other place. It's that we have no right to accuse the one whose house is near the slain, nor the one who lives near from the place where you were left killed, because it is possible that a man will be killed and then thrown out of people's doors so that they will be charged. Thereby such an act is to be rejected”. - Finally, about a group of people who, fight each other, and end in one killed or one injured without knowing who is responsible, Malek said: "The best thing I've heard about it is to demand the dyia of those who fought against him; and if the wounded or the killed was neither from one camp nor from another, the dyia will be demanded of both camps at the same time”. Chapter XIX Murder committed by treachery or magic. 
(1623) 43 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab ordered to kill five or seven people who knocked out, by treachery a man, and he said: "if all the inhabitants of Sana'a (city in Yaman where the crime took place) had conspired for his murder, I would have ordered them all to be killed at once”. 
(1624) 44 - It was reported to Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Sa'd Ibn Zarara that Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had ordered to kill one of her slaves she had already freed posthumously, for having bewitched her". - Malek said: "the magician practicing sorcery, without being bewitched by another (killing another by his magic) is to be compared to the man about whom Allah said in his Book (meaning): "Men know that he who does the acquisition of these vanities, will have no part in future life” (Koran 11,102). Therefore, he must be killed if he committed the murder himself”. Chapter XX The willful crime 
(1625) 45 - Omar Ibn Houssein, the freedman of Aisha Bint Koudama, recounted that Abdul-Malek Ibn Marwan delivered a man who had killed another with a stick to the defender of the victim who, he killed the culprit with a stick. - Malek said: “The unquestionably followed standard with us (in Medina) is as follows: "In case a man strikes another with a stick or throws a stone at him or even strikes him voluntarily, and the man dies, such is the voluntary crime subject to the law of the retaliation”. - Malek added: “Thus, the crime considered voluntary with us (in Medina), is for one man to strike another until he dies; on the other hand, it is still a voluntary crime, the fact that a man strikes another because of animosity or even as a result of a quarrel, and then leaves him still alive. However, if this last one dies as a result of hemorrhage, we will resort to "Kaça-ma" (see next chapter). - Malek finally said, “What we follow at us (in Medina) is that in the course of willful murder, guilty freemen should be killed by one freeman, women by one woman, and slaves by one slave”. Chapter XXI The law of retaliation applied to a murder 
(1626) 46 - It was reported to Malek that Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam had written to Mu'awia Ibn Abi Sufian that a drunken man had been brought to him, who killed a man. On this subject, Moua'wia answered him "Make him killed". - Malek said: “The best I heard about the explanation of this verse (the meaning): “The free man for the free man, the slave for the slave“, (Koran II, 178), such are the males, and "the free woman for the free woman", it is that the application of the law of retaliation is the same, both to women and to men. Thus, one kills a free woman for a free woman, just as one kills a free man for a free man, yet one kills a male or female slave, for a male or female slave. female. So the law of retaliation is applied the same way too women as well as men, in accordance with the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in his book (meaning): "We have prescribed for them, in the Torah: life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth. Wounds fall under the law of retaliation” (Koran V,45). Thus, Allah Blessed and Most High had mentioned that life is for life, meaning that the free woman can be killed by a free man, and his wounds are like his, subject to the law of retaliation". - Concerning the man who cares for another, a man for the second to strike the third and kill him on the spot, Malek said, "If the first holds the third, so that the second can kill the latter, both must be killed. But if he holds him believing that the second wishes to strike the third, thereby wishing to reform him, without his seeking to kill him, the murderer must be killed; as for the one who held the victim, he will be severely judged and imprisoned for one year without being condemned to death”. - Concerning the man who voluntarily kills a another or put out his eye, after which the murderer will be killed, or they will put out his eye, before the law of retaliation is applied to him, Malek said: “He will neither pay a dyia, nor be subject to the law retaliation, because he who has been killed or whose eye has been gouged out, had the right to apply a similar sanction to one who has voluntarily killed. Because in fact he is in the same situation as that of a man who voluntarily kills, then dies. Thus, since the murderer is dead, the parents of the victim will not be entitled to a dyia, nor to any other legal compensation, and this by reference to what Allah Blessed and Most High has said in His Book: “the law of retaliation is prescribed for you in case of murder: the free man for the free man, the slave for the slave” (Coran 11,178). - Explaining this, Malek said, “So then the victim has the full right to apply the law of retaliation to the murderer; but if the murderer dies, the victim will have neither blood money nor an application of the law of retaliation”. - Finally Malek said: "the law of retaliation is not not to apply to a freeman injuring a slave; but if a slave voluntarily kills a free man, he will be killed; as for the free man killing a slave, he will not be killed even if the crime is voluntary. And that's the best I've heard." Chapter XXII Forgiveness for a voluntary crime 
(1627) 47 - Yahia reported that Malek had crossed men versed in religion and approved of him, say: "If a murdered man recommends (before dying), to forgive his murderer who killed him voluntarily, it is permissible for him, because he had more than right than others, to dispose of the person of the murderer (namely either to condemn him to death or to pardon him). - Concerning a murdered man, who forgives, before to die to his killer who killed him willfully, once sentenced to death, Malek said, "The victim no longer has the right to blood money, except that he asks her for it by granting her forgiveness”. - And Malek to continue: In case the willful killer is pardoned, he will be flogged for a hundred lashes, and will be imprisoned for a year. - When a man voluntarily kills another, and this is already in evidence, while the victim has sons and daughters, if the sons forgive the killer and the daughters refuse him, this forgiveness is valid as long as it is more considered than that of the girls; therefore the girls will have no right to claim nor forgiveness, nor blood money". Chapter XXIII The application of the law of retaliation, about injuries. (1628) - Malek said: "What is unquestionably followed with us (in Mcdine), in the subject of the one who voluntarily causes a fracture in the hand or in the foot of a man, it is to apply the law of retaliation to him without claiming the dyia”. -Also Malek said: "The law of retaliation will not be applied to the culprit only if the wounds are healed- If the wound caused to the culprit is similar to that of the attacked once healed, such will be the penalty; in case the wound is more grawc, or else the culprit is dead, the assailed owes the culprit nothing-If the assailed becomes paralyzed or his wounds have healed leaving a bodily defect or deformity or dislocation , while the aggressor is completely cured, he will not have the right let the culprit have his other hand broken, or let him be punished. However one pays, by compensation the dyia which must be equivalent to that dislocation; and wounds will be treated the same as broken bones”. -Malek said a if a man voluntarily dies a eye to his wife, or breaks her hand or cuts off her finger, or causes her a similar injury he will be subject to the law of retaliation. As for the man who hits his wife with a rope or a whip, thus causing her any harm whatsoever involuntarily, he will pay the dyia without being subject to the law of retaliation”. (....)“-Malek finally said I was told that Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Amer ibn Hazm had decided to apply the retaliation far for a fractured thigh”- Chapter XXIV What is suitable as dyia to "Al Sa'iba" and the crime he commits 
(1629) 49 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that a pilgrim had freed his esdave as a Sa'iba, this one killed a man from Bani 'Aez. The father of the victim comes to find Omar Ibn AI-Khattab, claiming the blood money of his son-Omar says to him: "He does not have the right to a dyia”; then the father answered: What will be your decision if my son had killed him”? Omar replied, "In that case, you you have to pay him the dyia» - The father then said: "So he is like a viper who left, she eats everything, killed, another viper will take revenge". (1) Al Sa'iba is a slave freed by his master without the latter retaining the right to patronize him. (2) It was said in pre-Islamic times when a viper was Killing another viper was his revenge. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah the Merciful the Merciful Book 44 The Book of the “Kaçama”(1) First chapter: On the primacy given to rights holders to do "the Kaçama" (1) The Kaçama: comes from the word "Kaçama" meaning: "to swear"; thus one asks the having-rights to swear, in the event of a crime, in order to claim the price of blood of their victim or the application of the talion. According to other scholars, it is a question of asking the heirs to take the oath fifty times, provided that they are males, and that according to their shares. of inheritance. There then, the term “Kaçama” means to distribute “the oath”. 
(1630) 1 - Sahl Ibn Abi Hathma reported that notables of his tribe told him the following: “Abdallah Ibn Sahl and Muhayssa, having suffered a total defeat, went to Khaibar. We came to tell Muhayssa that Abdallah Ibn Sahl had been knocked unconscious and abandoned near a well or a palm tree. Jews arriving at the place, Muhayssa said to them: “It is you, by Allah, who killed him”, and the Jews replied: “By Allah!, we did not kill him”. Mouhayssa, returned to his tribe, to inform them of the event, then came with his brother Houayssa, who was taller than him, and Abdul Rahman. Thus, Muhayssa, who was in Khaibar, wanting to speak, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) remarked to him: "Let the greatest have the word"; Houayssa spoke, then his brother Mouhayssa had to his turn the word, after which, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) answered them: “Or that the Jews pay the price of blood, or that the war is declared”. Then the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) informed the Jews of his decision in writing, who answered him: “By Allah! we did not kill him”. So, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to Houayssa, Muhayssa and Abdul Rahman: "Would you swear, which will make you deserve the price of your brother's blood"? When they refused, he continued: “Would you like the Jews to swear to it”? - "No," they replied, "they don't are not Muslims. Thus, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) paid them from his goods (namely from the public treasury) the price of blood, sending them a hundred camels, which were returned to their abode, where Sahl said: "the camels being received by us, one of them, red-haired, kicked me ". 
(1631) 2 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Bouchair Ibn Yassar told him the following: “Abdallah Ibn Sahl al Ansari and Muhayssa Ibn Massou'd having gone to Khaibar where they parted for business, Abdallah Ibn Sahl was knocked unconscious. Then Muhayssa came to the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) accompanied by his older brother-Houyassa and Abdul rahman Ibn Sahl. Abdul Rahman, being the brother of the victim, wanting to speak, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: "May the greatest have the speech"; thus Houayssa took the floor then Mouhayssa, and learned from the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) does. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to them: "Would you, by fifty times, oath and you would deserve the blood money of your brother or the culprit”? They replied, “O Messenger of Allah! We were neither present nor witnesses to this fact”. So the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to them: "Do you want the Jews swear to you their innocence, fifty times”? They replied, “No! Messenger of Allah! How could we accept the oath of unbelieving people? - Yahia Ibn Sa'id added: "Bouchair Ibn yassar claimed that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) paid with his goods, the price of blood”. - Malek said, “What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina) and which I heard being practiced by those who accepted the Kaçama, and which, on the other hand, had been concerted by the ulemas in the past and nowadays, it is that we must proceed to make "the Kaçama", by asking the accused to take an oath. As a result, this Kaçama is only obligatory in two cases: either that the victim, before dying, says: "so-and-so killed me", or that the parents, again say, the beneficiaries present a evidence, however weak, and not conclusive against the culprit. In this case, the Kaçama is required for the accusers against the accused, and the Kaçama will never be admitted in any other case”. - Malek to add: "This is the sunna which is indisputable, and which moreover continues to be put into practice by people, namely, asking the rights holders to start doing "the kaçama", whether it is a voluntary crime or not". - Malek to continue: “and the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had first asked the men of the Haritha tribe - who are the subject of the two previous hadiths - to do the Kaçama with regard to their victim killed in Khaibar". - Malek said further: "If the accusers proceed at the "Kaçama", they will be entitled to the price of the blood of their victim, and even to kill the culprit. However, "the Kaçama", being done, only one culprit will be killed, and never two. Thus, for "the Kaçama" to be executed, fifty men among the beneficiaries will make fifty oaths; but if their number is less or even if some abstain, their oath is no longer to be considered, and the others must thus complete the fifty oaths. But if among those who have abstained, there is one of the heirs who has the right and the price of blood and the right to forgive, there will no longer be an application of the death penalty to the accused. - And Malek continued: “So if one of the fifty, not enjoying the right of forgiveness, abstains, the others will have to complete the fifty oaths; but if it is one of the heirs who is entitled to forgiveness, abstains, even if he were a single individual, the other heirs are not asked to complete the fifty oaths, for the good reason, that it comes back to the accused to take the oath for fifty times, so that each will do it for once; if the number is less than fifty, they will complete them; if there is only one accused, it is up to him alone to make the fifty oaths, if he is innocent”. - Malek to add: "Besides, we have to do the distinction between the "Kaçama" concerning blood money, and the oaths proper to rights (namely that the Kaçama requires fifty oaths, as for the other, it is only of one oath). And Malek explains it: if a man owes a debt to another and he manages to to prove it effectively, and that the man intends to kill another, he will not kill him in the midst of the people, but he seeks to do it far from them, and without there being witnesses. Because if the Kaçama were to be considered, only in the case where there is clear evidence, and if we proceeded to put it into practice in the same way that is appropriate for the affirmation of other rights, blood would be shed. everywhere (meaning, that the killing will be increasing); therefore, people, taking part in it, would not stop practicing murder. However, the "Kaçama" was not held as standard to the victim's heirs, beginning with taking an oath, only for the purpose of inducing people to repel the practice of killing; also, so that the murderer is only condemned according to what is decided by the victim before his death. - On the other hand, concerning the people, who are at number of fifty being accused of murder, while the number of heirs is less than that, Malek said: "Each of these heirs will make for fifty times an oath, emphasizing that their oaths will not be considered unless each has made oath for fifty times”. And, that's the best I've heard about it. -Finally Malek said: "The Kaçama comes back to the close relatives of the killed who are in fact his heirs; and who if they take an oath the accused will be killed. Chapter II The heirs from whom the Kaçama is accepted. (1632) -Malek said, "What is a standard unquestionably followed in (in Medina), it is that one does not accept "the Kacama" of women, when it is a voluntary crime. In case the victim has only women for heirs, one does not accept neither their Kaçama^ nor their forgiveness”. - Malek added: a.-In case a man is willfully killed, and that his relatives or his freedmen say: "We will take an oath and we will have the price of our victim's blood" this is tolerated. b- - If women want to forgive the guilty they are not allowed to do so because close male relatives and freedmen have more rights than they do in taking an oath to have blood money”. c. - In case the close relatives and the freedmen forgive the culprit, after having had the price of blood, and that the women refuse saying: "We do not want to leave the murderer of our victim, there they will have the right and the primacy to do so, because he who is for the application of the law of retaliation has more right than the relatives and the women who left him, once this judgment was legally possible". d. - For a crime made of any will, one do not accept less than two of the accusers who are asked to take an oath fifty times in order to have the right to convict the culprit. And such is the norm with us (in Medina)”. e. - If a group of people hit a name until that he dies under the blows on the spot, all are punishable by the death penalty. So if he dies after this attack, we proceed to the Kaçama. This Kaçama is only held for a single man who is the victim and it is only to be applied in the case of a single man”. Chapter III The Kaçama relating to an involuntary crime (1633) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: "If it is an involuntary crime, we ask the entitled to take an oath for fifty times, according to the inheritance distributed among them. If, the Kaçama done, fractions are present, the one who has the largest share is asked to swear much more than the others (so that the fifty oaths are completed”. - Malek said: “if the victim has only women to inherit it, they will swear and have the dyia, if the victim has only one male heir, he will take an oath for fifty times and will have the dyia. However, this is to be applied in the event that it is an involuntary crime and not the contrary”. Chapter IV The inheritance, in case the Kaçama is pronounced. (1634) - Malek said: “If the heirs beneficiaries, accept the dyia, it will be shared between them, according to what is prescribed in the Book of Allah, namely that the daughters of the victim, her sisters, as well as other females will inherit this blood money. If, the distributed dyia, leaves a remainder, this returns to the closest to the killed man”. - And Malek to add: "If someone from the heirs of the man voluntarily killed, intends to have his share of the dyia, which is his right, while the others are not present, he will be able to take nothing, and will not collect anything from the dyia less or more, before until he has completed the Kaçama, that is, until the fifty oaths have been taken. So if these oaths are made, he'll take his share of the dyia, because in fact the blood money is only due if the fifty oaths have already been fulfilled, and the dyia is only due after the condemnation of the culprit. Now if soon after one of the heirs arrives, and he swears as much as his share of the inheritance, he may to have his share of the dyia until all the heirs have had it, in turn. If a uterine brother presents himself, he will have the sixth of the dyia and will make 6/50 of the oaths; thus, every heir who has sworn an oath, will receive his share; on the other hand, the one who prevents himself from doing it, he will receive nothing. On the other hand, if some heirs are absent, or even that there are prepubescent boys, those who are already present, will each make an oath in proportion to his share of the dyia, also though to his share of the inheritance. - Malek finally said, "and that's, what I help heard best about it." Chapter V The Kaçama of slaves (1635) - Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina), about slaves in case one of them is voluntarily or involuntarily killed, then his boss comes up with a witness, swears once, he is entitled to the price of his slave. Thus, on the subject of the voluntary or involuntary murder of slaves, the norm of the Kaçama is not applied, and I have not heard that a man versed in religion has acted otherwise”. Thus, continues Malek, if the slave is voluntarily or involuntarily killed, the master of this slave has neither to take account of a Kaçama, nor to sow seeds; although this master is not entitled to the price of the slave, unless he presents clear evidence or a witness swearing with him”. - And Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it."
