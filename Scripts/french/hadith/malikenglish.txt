(141) 111 - Ourwa said: "the woman who undergoes a flow of blood, makes a single lotion, then makes her ablutions for each prayer". Malek said: "What is followed in Medina is that the woman who has a discharge, when she can pray, her husband has the right to have carnal intercourse with her, so it is the case of the woman who has given birth when the blood stops flowing after the maximum period following childbirth. But if she sees the blood, her husband will have the right to coitus with her, because she will be considered as a woman who undergoes a flow of blood”.

Once awake, Abdallah came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and told him his dream.

(150) 2 - Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "when you hear the call at prayer, repeat what the muezzin says”.
(151) 3 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "If people knew the merit that there is , to make the call to prayer, and to be in the front row (praying in common) and that they find no other means to arrive there than the drawing of lots, they would have drawn lots. If they knew what merit there is in arriving early to pray in the mosque, they would have hastened there. And if they knew what there is as merit in praying the evening prayer and that of the dawn together, they would have surrendered, even dragging themselves on all fours”.
(152) 4 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "When you hear the second call to prayer, do not you do not go there in a hurry, rather come in peace. What you manage to do in common, do it, and complete what you have missed. Each of you is considered to be in prayer as long as you seek to accomplish it”.
(153) 5 - Al-Mazini reported from his father that Abu Sa'id Al Khudri said to him: “I see that you love sheep and the desert. When you are with your sheep, or in the desert, and you call for prayer, raise your voice because no genius, a human being, nor what is inanimate, will hear the range of the voice of the muezzin, without 'He testifies in his favor on the day of resurrection'. Abu Sa'id added: "This is what I heard from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah)."
(154) 6 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "When one calls for prayer, Satan go away, and fart so as not to hear this call. Once the first call is over, it comes back and stays until the time of the second call. When the second call was made, Satan goes away again and then comes back to place himself between the man and his heart, suggesting to him and saying: "Remember such a thing, remember such a thing, at which this man never thought, that in the end, he no longer remembers the number of raka'ts he has already performed". 155) 7- Sahl Ibn Sa'd As-Sa'idi said: “There are two times (lit. two hours) when the Gates of Heaven are opened and few people call on Allah and their prayers are not answered: when we call for prayer and when we line up to fight in the way of Allah”. Malek was asked about the timing of the call to prayer, will Friday be before its appointed time. He replied, “no, his moment will be when the sun has left the meridian”. Malek was asked about the two calls to prayer and when should people get up to pray? He answered: "I don't know about them other than what I saw the men do: at the second call you don't repeat the same words twice (which you do for the first) and that's what that well-informed people keep doing in Medina. As for the time when people should get up to pray after the second call, I do not find in this a very specific time, but I see clearly that we must take into consideration the capacity of the men, because among them there are there will be both the strong and the weak, and they cannot all be alike”. Malek was asked about the people all present to make the prescribed prayer, in common; so they wanted to make the second call without the first? He answered: “that is enough because the first call was imposed only in the mosques attended by a multitude of people where one makes the prayer in common”. Malek was asked again about the muezzin's greeting to the imam and his invitation to preside over the prayer and who was the first person to be greeted? He replied, "I have not been informed that this salutation was practiced in the first period". Malek was asked about a man who calls for prayer but no one is present to pray with him; so he makes the second call, and prays alone, after which people come to pray, will he have to repeat the prayer with them? He answered: "no, he will not have to do it again, and whoever comes after the prayer has ended, he can perform it alone". Malek was asked about a man who calls for prayer and then makes a supererogatory prayer. People arriving at the mosque, wanted someone else to make the second call can be made by another person”. Malek said, “We keep making the first dawn prayer call before the dawn appears. As for the other prayers, the first call is made only after their appointed times.
(156) 8 - It was reported to Malek that the muezzin came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab to warn him that it is time for the dawn prayer. Finding him asleep, he said to him, “prayer is better than sleep. Omar subsequently ordered this to be uttered in the first dawn call to prayer.
(157) 9 Souhail Ibn Malek reported from his father that he said: "What I saw the men (it is understood: the companions of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him be grace and the peace of Allah)) do (without changing it) this is the first call to prayer”.
(157) 9 Souhail Ibn Malek reported from his father that he said: “What I saw the men (it is understood: the companions of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him be grace and the peace of Allah)) do (without changing it) this is the first call to prayer”.

(160) 12 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar, being on a trip, he only made the second call to prayer except for that of the dawn, where he made the first. He said: “the first call to prayer was imposed only to invite people to gather around the imam (to pray in common).
(161) 13 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father told him: "when you are traveling, you can make the first and the second call to prayer, and you can be satisfied with the second without the first". Malek said "there is no harm in a man making the first call to prayer as he straddles his mount".
(162) 14 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab said: “He who prays (alone) in a deserted place, an angel on his right and another on his left pray with him.

(l66) 18 - Ali Ibn Hussain Ibn Ali Ibn Abi Taleb reported: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) pronounced takbir (say: Allah is tall) when he stooped down (to bow or prostrate) and raising your head from prostration.

(171) 24 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab said: "when a man manages to make a single raka't (in common) and pronounces the takbir once, that was enough for him". Malek, commenting on this, said: "when the man wants by this takbir to begin his prayer". Malek was asked about a man who comes to pray in common behind the imam, forgetting to do the takbir at the beginning of the prayer, and at the bow, until he has accomplished one raka't, then remembering this, he pronounces the takbir during the second raka't”? He replied: “It is preferable to me that he does the takbir at the beginning of the prayer even if he forgets to do it while following the imam and he does it during the first bow, because that is enough for him. he regards it as the takbir of the beginning”. About the one who prays alone, forgetting to pronounce the takbir at the beginning, Malek said: “he can continue his prayer”. And regarding, the imam who forgets the takbir from the beginning of the prayer, until he accomplishes it, Malek said: “I think he must resume the prayer, as well as for those who prayed with him, even if the latter pronounced the takbir, they must do it again”.

(581) 7 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab said: "The first who took zakat, donations, was Mu'awia Ibn Abi Sufian" Malek said: "Which is an undeniable tradition and followed in Medina, it is that the zakat must be paid for twenty dinars in gold, as well as for a sum of two hundred dirhams”. A - Malek also said: “Zakat is not obligatory for the sum of twenty dinars (in gold), if their weight is less than that of twenty real dinars; if the weight is constant at that of twenty, the zakat is payable. On the other hand, zakat is not payable for an amount less than twenty dinars in gold. The zakat is not even payable for a sum of two hundred dirhams whose weight is less than that of two other two hundred which really have a constancy of weight, and where the zakat is to be paid. If these coins are variable, due to their weight from one balance to another, the zakat is, in my opinion, obligatorily payable”. B Malek said: "If the man has one hundred and sixty dirhams having a very constant real weight, and in his country eight dirhams are exchanged for one dinar, he should only pay zakat on them, only when the dirhams exchanged be equivalent to twenty dinars in gold or two hundred dirhams in silver”. C - Malek said about a man owning five dinars which came to him from a profit or other source; this sum, bringing him from a trade a profit after the lapse of a year, which is in his possession, and according to Malek, subject to zakat. However, this new capital, will not be subject to zakat, neither a day after the lapse of a year, nor a day before; the zakat is payable, after one year has passed, from the very day the capital was formed”. D - Malek said, about a man who, having ten dinars, then benefiting from this sum, in the field of commerce, to reach twenty dinars after the lapse of a year, he must submit this new sum to zakat without waiting for a year to elapse from the day it was formed, because that period elapsed when he owned twenty dinars. Subsequent zakat is not payable until one year after the penultimate one has been paid. E - Malek added: "What has been heard about slave wages and their tribute, the wages of the poor, and the price of freeing the indentured slave, is that all these cases are not subject of zakat, and this whatever the sum, unless a year has already passed, precisely from the day on which the beneficiary received the sum". F - And Malek says again: “for gold and silver that are in association, where each has a share of twenty dinars or two hundred dirhams, they owe zakat. Whoever has less than that is exempt from paying zakat. If all the shares are subject to zakat, but with a variation, when the value of these shares is different from one share to another, so that some shares are less than the sum where it is the duty to pay the zakat, as for the others, if the sum is higher, the zakat will be provided for in these last shares, also according to their values; for the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "zakat is not obligatory for a sum of less than five ounces of silver". Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." - Malek said: “If a man has gold and silver, but they are scattered among the people, he must assess them so that he pays on them, the due zakat”. - And from the saying of Malek: "He who, by inheritance or by gift, obtains gold and silver, the zakat on their subject, is only due, before the lapse of one year ".

(582) 8 - Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdel-Rahman reported from many that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had granted Bilal Ibn Al-Hareth the privilege of a territory on the coast containing the mines of Qabaliya, on the side of "Four'" (Between Medina and Nakieh). These mines are still subject to zakat”. Malek said: “I think and Allah is most informed that these buried metals are only due for zakat, when what is of their extracts is equivalent to twenty dinars or two hundred dirhams; and whatever is in excess, shall likewise be subject to zakat according to the legal assessment of zakat; in case one does not manage to extract, what is valuable from these metals, nothing is subject to zakat, only when what is extracted is equivalent to twenty dinars in gold or two hundred dirhams in money taking into account the first valuation". And Malek said, “metal is to be compared to crops; both are subject to zakat; what is extracted from the first is subject to zakat, without the expectation of a year passing; as for harvests, the tenth of their quantity is for zakat, and that, before one year is exceeded. Chapter IV Of the zakat of buried metals called: “Al - Rikaz”
(583) 9 - Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "the rikaz is subject to the fifth". (the buried treasure) Malek said: "what is unquestionably followed in Medina, and which, moreover, I have heard from the scholars is that: the rikaz is all that is buried from the time before -Islamic; it is all one can have without price, expense, hard work, or provision. On the other hand, what requires an effort, or an expense, and where one has the risk of finding or not by digging, it is not rikaz. Chapter V Of what is not subject to zakat such as jewelry, gold dust and amber.
(584) 10 - Abdel-rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported from his father that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r Upon him the grace and peace of Allah took care of her orphan nieces , who lived under her tutelage, keeping their jewels for them, without her paying zakat on them.
(585) 11 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar, did not pay the zakat, on the objects of adornment, of his daughters and his slaves (females). Malek said: "Whoever possesses powdered gold or gold or silver jewelry not serving as adornment, must pay zakat on them, every year by taking a quarter of a tenth after weighing them, unless the value is not twenty dinars in gold or two hundred dirhams in silver, if what he possesses is less than that, zakat is not payable. As for powdered gold or broken jewelry whose owner intends to repair, then use it for adornment, they are held like furniture in a house and are not subject to zakat”. Malek also said: “neither pearls, nor musk, nor amber, are subject to zakat”. Chapter VI The subject of zakat with respect to the property of orphans, and the profit they bring in trade.
(586) 12 • It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "Make the goods of the orphans grow in trade, otherwise the zakat will eat away at them."
(587) 13 - Abdel-Rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported from his father the following: “Aisha, took care of me and my brother, being two orphans, under his guardianship; she paid zakat, goods that we had”.
(588) 14 • It was reported to Malek, that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) exposed to trade, the money which went to the orphans, being under his supervision.
(589) 15 - Malek reported that Yahia Ibn Sa'id bought for his orphan nephews, living under his guardianship, property, which was later sold, bringing in a great profit”. Malek said, “There is no harm in the money of the orphans being put into commerce in case the protector is authorized to do so; I don't think that the protector should thereby provide a guarantee. Chapter VII Inheritances subject to zakat.
(590) 16 - Malek said: "When a man dies and he has not paid the zakat of his property, I find it good that the zakat is taken from the third of his inheritance, taking into account that this does not must in no case be more than one third. It is even necessary that the zakat be deducted from it before terminating the will, because, in my opinion. This is considered in the form of debts which must be discharged”. Malek continuing: “this is the case of a man who has already made his will; if this is not the case, it is necessary that his people do it, because it will be a good way to act; moreover, they are not obliged to do so”. Malek also said: "It is undisputed tradition and good practice (in Medina) that someone who inherits should not pay zakat for any property he receives from a loan repaid to the dead, of a transaction, of a residence, of a slave, of a slave before a year has passed, from the day on which he collects the sum which comes to him from the sale of this property" . On the other hand, what is our tradition, says Malek, is that the heir does not owe zakat for an estate until one year has passed”. Chapter VIII Of the zakat due on a debt.
(591) 17 Al-Saib Ibn Yazid reported that Osman Ibn Affan said: “This is the month of paying your zakat. He who owes a debt, let him discharge it, and when you have recovered your rights, pay the zakat on them”. (592) 18- Ayoub Ibn Abi Tamima Al-Sakhtiane reported that Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz ordered, in writing, his prefects, who unjustly collected taxes, from taxpayers, to return them by taking from them the zakat due to the years already passed. Then he revised his opinion and prescribed that this zakat is to be collected for one time only because it was no longer known, from whom these taxes had been collected, and whether or not he had to pay the zakat”.
(593) 19 - Yazid Ibn Khoussaifa reported that he asked Suleiman Ibn Yassar About a man possessing and being in debt of the same amount of money; does he have to pay zakat for what he owns? He replied, "No". Malek said: "What is not to be discussed for the question of debts is that the one who lends, only pays zakat, after having recovered his loan, even if the debtor owes this debt for many years; and in this case, the one who has the right, owes the zakat only once after having recovered the loan. In the event that he partially recovers the loan, this sum is not subject to zakat; but if he has a sum, other than the one he has just had, after recovery of his debt, this sum is subject to zakat, which will be relative to the sum in question, and to the part of the loan which he had already recovered". Malek continued, “In case this man does not own his loan, and this is not due for zakat, then zakat is not payable; but that he remember well what he has already recovered, because when there is an addition of such kind, that everything will be subject to zakat, he must pay it”. And Malek went on to say, “In case the sum recovered from the loan has been consumed or not, the zakat is obligatory with what he will have collected on the other hand, which with the first part is equivalent to twenty dinars in gold, or two hundred silver dirhams. As for what he will recover later from the loan, be it a little or a lot, the zakat in this case will be payable in relation to the sum”. Malek resumed: "As proof of what has just been mentioned, about the debt, so that it was recovered after a good number of years, about the zakat, which is appropriate for him, it does not is payable only once, - it is to be compared to a commodity, being and remaining with a merchant for several years; selling it, the merchant will only pay the zakat he owes his merchandise once. It is that the owner of the goods or the creditor no longer has to pay the zakat due on a good which, if necessary, belongs to a third person; the zakat, in fact, is required only of a good in material possession" Malek finally said: "For the man who is charged with a debt to be paid, and has its equivalence in goods, in addition to a amount of money subject to zakat; in this case the zakat is due for the sum liquidated without taking into account what he must pay as debt, or what he possesses as merchandise; but once the sum in cash exceeds that which he owes, he must pay the zakat due on this surplus”. Chapter IX Goods subject to zakat.
(594) 20 Zuraik Ibn Hayyan, in charge of controlling passengers entering Egypt in the time of Al-Walid, Suleiman and Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz, reported that Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz ordered it in writing, to observe the Moslem passengers who enter, to take part of the money which they possess, and of the value of their goods destined for trade, by collecting on each sum of forty dinars, one dinar; to take into account what is less than that, until reaching the bottom of twenty dinars, and if it is still less than twenty, namely by a third, in this case, to collect nothing”. As for passengers who live under Muslim protection, to be collected from them, one dinar out of twenty of the value of their goods which are for sale; to consider, which is less than that up to ten dinars; if it is less than ten dinars, to demand nothing, even if it is less than a third of the dinar, not to profit. To give them in exchange, valid receipts, for one year, for what you perceive from them”. A - Malek said: "which is the practice in Medina, in the field of commerce, in case a man pays what he owes for zakat, and then buys, with what he possesses, a variety of goods; silk, slaves, or the like and sells his purchases before one year has passed, that man owes nothing as zakat until after one year from the day he paid the first zakat. On the other hand, if what he had bought remains at home, unsold, and this for several years, he will not have to pay the zakat due, even if it will last for a long time, until the sale has been completed. location; at that time, zakat will be paid for one time only,'. B - For the subject who buys wheat, dates or other goods with gold or silver coins and keeps them to sell, but after a year has already passed, Is zakat payable for such merchandise? Malek replied, “Zakat is obligatory on the day of the sale, if the sum withheld from the sale is assessed to be subject to zakat; and that is not to be compared to the case of the harvest where the man obtains the output of his harvest, nor even to that of the cutting of the palm trees”. C - Malek said: "if the man has money invests in the field of trade for profit, and this is not the case, zakat is obligation on this, and this taking as a point of reference a month of the year, where he will make a census by evaluating the available merchandise, and what he has as liquidated sum in gold or other; if the total amount is subject to zakat, it is payable”. D - Malek added: "those who practice, or not, trade, they are all the same, and only pay zakat once a year". Chapter X Of what relates to treasure (buried).
(595) 21 - Abdallah Ibn Dinar reported that he heard Abdallah Ibn Umar inquire about the buried treasure? What is it? And answer: “It is of all the metals, which are not due for zakat”?.
(596) 22 - Abu Saieh Al-Samman reported that Abu Hurairah said: "Whoever owns goods, and who does not pay on them what he owes for zakat, these goods, on the day of resurrection, will take the form of a python, with a bald head, equipped with two small horns, seeking the possessor of goods to capture him, saying to him: "I am your treasure". Chapter XI Of the zakat of the herds.
(597) 23 - Yahia reported that Malek said: that he read the information prescribed by Omar Ibn Al-Khattab relating to the zakat, and there he found: - For twenty and four camels, (24) or a lower number, the zakat is one monton for every five camels. - For a number beyond twenty-four, (24) reaching thirty-five, (35) inclusive, the zakat is a Camel of one year old, otherwise, a camel of two years old. - For a number varying between thirty and five, (35) and forty and five, (45) a camel two years old. - For what is between forty and six, (46) up to sixty, (60) inclusive, a camel three years old and ready for copulation. Between sixty-one (61) and sixty-fifteen, (75) inclusive, a four-year-old female camel. - From seventy-six (76) to ninety-ten, (90) two camels of two years of age. - From ninety and eleven, (91) to one hundred and twenty, (120) two camels three years old and ready for copulation. - For all that is beyond one hundred and twenty-one, (121) a one-year-old camel for every forty (40) camels, and a three-year-old camel ready for copulation for every fifty (50 ). - As for the sheep: forty to a hundred and twenty (from 40 to 120) a sheep. - For between one hundred and twenty-one (121) and two hundred, (200) the zakat is two sheep. - From two hundred and one (201) to three hundred, (300) three sheep. - From three hundred and one (301) and beyond this number, one sheep for each hundred. - On the other hand, one should not give alms, neither of a goat, nor of an old animal, nor of an animal which has lost a limb, unless the collector agrees to take it. ". - One should not group two lots, nor separate a group of two lots because of the zakat. - In case there is a mixture of two lots, where they cannot be distinguished, both owners owe zakat. - With regard to money, the zakat is a quarter of a tenth if the weight is equal to or exceeds five ounces. Chapter XII Of the zakat of cows.
(598) 24 - Taous Al-Yemeni reported that Mu'az Ibn Jabal Al-Ansari took from thirty cows, the zakat of a calf of one year old, and from forty cows, a cow of three years old without collect anything from what was less than that saying: "I have not heard anything from the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) On him the grace and gaix of Allah as information about them, and I I'll ask him when I meet him". But the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) died before Mu'az met him. A - Malek said: "The best I have heard said about a man, owning a herd (of cows) which two or more shepherds, in different countries, had taken care of, than this man owes zakat for his reunited flock. His case is to be compared to one who possesses a sum of gold or silver, but to the holding of several persons; he must identify it and evaluate it so that he pays the zakat, if this sum is subject to it”. B - About the man owning a herd of sheep and goats, Malek said: "he must bring them together to know what is the zakat due to them because this herd will be considered as made up of sheep alone, and that in referring us to the letter of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab (mentioned above): “from forty sheep, one sheep”. C - Malek added: “If the number of sheep is more than that of goats, the owner of the herd owes only one sheep for the collector in charge of the zakat case. If the goats are outnumbered by the sheep, the collector takes a goat (or goat). If the sheep and the goats are the same number, the collector will choose one as he pleases”. D - Yahia reported that Malek said: “it is the same case that arises, if they are camels called: “Arabs”, or camels with long necks called: “boukhts”. Malek said, “They are ultimately all camels; if the number of Arabs exceeds that of the boukht, and the owner owes only one more than that of the Arabs, he can take a boukht; if the number is the same for the two categories, the collector takes one of the kind he chooses”. E - Malek said, “It is the same, in the case of cows and buffaloes all put together; he said, “They are all cows. If the number of cows exceeds that of buffaloes, and the owner owes only one cow, the collector takes a cow, and if the buffaloes outnumber the cows, he takes a buffalo; if cows and buffaloes are equal in number, the collector will choose, one, of the kind he wishes. Finally, if zakat is required from both genders, the collector takes one of each gender”. F - Yahia reported that Malek said: "He who brings together camels, cows and sheep in his herd, owes no zakat until just one year has elapsed from the day when this meeting was made ; unless he previously had a herd subject to zakat, consisting of five camels, or thirty cows, or forty sheep. If the man owned five camels, or thirty cows, or forty sheep, and he added to them camels, cows, sheep, which came to him either by purchase, or by gift, or by inheritance, he must pay zakat on them when he pays it for what he had before the attached ones, even if a year had not yet elapsed, from the day he began to use their usufruct . In case zakat has been paid for animals that have been joined with others, he will pay zakat for them along with that of his herd. G - They are considered, and still according to Malek, as the money whose zakat was paid, then the man used this money to buy goods, while the zakat became of obligation, if he sells it; and in this case the former owner will have paid the zakat, the same day of the transaction, and the second owner the following day”. H - For the man who owned a herd of sheep not payable by zakat, to which he added other sheep, either by purchase or by inheritance, but the number of which does not call for zakat, this man do not have to pay zakat before one year has passed, just the day the purchase or inheritance took place is that the man in possession of a herd of camels, sheep and cows , whose number is not yet sufficient, to pay zakat; it will be in case each kind (of sheep, cows, camels) reaches the number where zakat is indebted. This is what is to be considered for the payment of zakat, when one joins the herd in a small or large number of the existing genera”. 1 - And Malek added: "For the man who owns camels, cows, or sheep where each kind, makes zakat indebted, and thereafter joins to what he owns, others of the same kind, the zakat is to be paid, for what he has together”. Yahia reports that Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." J - Malek said: "For the animal, whose zakat is indebted: if it is a camel of one year old and a man does not have it, he can give, in exchange, a camel of two years old If it is a camel two years old, or one of three years old, or even four years old, and the man does not have what he owes, it is better that he buys, than to give his price to the collector. K - As for what we use, camels or cows, either to bring water or to plow the land, Malek said: "I think that of those you have to pay zakat" . Chapter XIII From the zakat of a herd to different kinds.
(599) 25 - Yahia reported that Malek said, "If there is a mixture of two herds, and one shepherd, and where there is one stallion, one pasture, and one pail, the owners of this mixed herd, are associates even if the share of each can be determined. On the other hand, if we do not know the share of each, they are not partners but co-owners”. Malek said, “In case the owners are in common, the zakat is only due when the share of each is determined to be as such. This is interpreted as follows: “Whoever owns forty sheep, he owes zakat; as for the other who has less, zakat is not obligatory. In the event that each share is indebted for one zakat, the two parts can be combined, to receive only one zakat. Take for example the following: If one has a thousand sheep or less, and the other forty or more, they are joint owners and each pays the zakat corresponding to his share; for the case of the thousand and forty camels, their common owners will react like those who own sheep and where each will pay the suitable zakat to his share, if this one is indebted of a zakat; for the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: “Zakat is not payable for the number of camels less than five”; and Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said, "For less than forty sheep, zakat is not payable." Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." Malek added, “Umar Ibn Al-Khattaba said, “Never unite two shares, nor do you separate two shares, because of zakat,” when talking about those who own herds. To specify much more: “Never to reunite two separate parts”; supposing that it is a question of three persons, and that each is the owner of forty sheep; in this case, the zakat that everyone owes is one sheep. On the other hand, if the three people had gathered their possession, they can thereby trick the collector, make only one sheep to be zakat; but this is categorically prohibited”. This is what is to be understood from the words of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab: never to unite two parts, and neither to separate two parts”; and "that's the best I've heard, say," Malek says. Chapter XIV Of what is said of the zakat of goats.
(600) 26 - Soufian Ibn Abdallah reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab gave him the charge, to beg zakat, about newly born chevrons and goats. He is told, “why make this count, without any profit from zakat”? Back at Omar's, Soufian reports the protests to him; thus Omar says: “Yes, one must count them rafters and goats, which are carried in the arms of the shepherd (still infants), but which are not exigible from the zakat. We must not even take the one that is well fed, nor the ewe which has just given birth, nor the pregnant one, nor the stallion of sheep; but the zakat is to be collected in that of two completed years or of four completed years”. "For the owner of sheep whose number is not due for zakat, and for whom the ewes were going to give birth, one day before the collector was entitled to zakat, especially since the births were going to increase the number sheep, which is payable as zakat", Malek said, "If the sheep, from the births they had made, the number of sheep would increase, reaching a number requiring zakat, this must be paid . Because, the begetting of the ewes, and the increase in the number of the sheep are quite different from the number of the sheep which one bought, or which one received by inheritance or gift. It is the same case, of a commodity, the price of which is not worth, its submission to the zakat, but on its sale, the owner receives a profit where the zakat is of right, therefore, it is to be paid on the profit. But if the benefit comes from a capital gain, or an inheritance, the zakat is payable after one year has passed, from the day on which the interest or the inheritance was touched”. Malek said, “Kids and lambs are to be compared to the profits of capital; however, they are different, from another point of view, namely: if the man is the owner of a sum of gold or silver which owes zakat, to which he adds another sum; this addition is not subject to zakat when it is paid for what it had before, until after the passage of one year, from the day the new sum was added. But in case the man is possessor of sheep, cows or camels, the category of each species of which is subject to zakat, and he adds a camel, a cow, or a sheep, he must pay zakat for what has been added, when he has paid it for what he had before if the number deserves to be subject to zakat”. Malek said, "that's the best explanation I've heard about it." Chapter XV Of the two-year cumulative zakat.
(601) 27 - Yahia reported that Malek said, “For the man who owns a hundred camels who owe zakat but to whose house the collector does not come to claim it until the day the zakat became cumulative for two years; and by chance the man must have lost what camels he had, having only five, the collector will only be entitled to two sheep for zakat on the remaining five camels, in the sense that it is one sheep per year. The zakat in this case is only counted according to what the man has on the day he pays it, whether the herd has perished or been increased. If zakats have been accumulated for several years, he will pay only one zakat and that on the day it must be paid; and if in this case his herd is no more, or the number has been reduced to such an extent that he no longer deserves to be subject to zakat, he will have nothing to pay, and no zakat is due for what has perished from this herd even if the zakat has been accumulated for several years”. Chapter XVI On the prohibition, to constrain the subjects from whom one perceives the zakat.
(602) 28 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported: "Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, being passing by, near a herd of sheep which is due for zakat, noticed a sheep with large and swollen udders; he asked where this sheep came from”?; “it is part of the zakat”, they answered him; "I don't think its owner handed it over willingly"! Omar retorted and added, "Never seek to embarrass people, take nothing that is so precious from Muslims, and avoid claiming from them, dairy females under zakat."
(603) 29 - Muhammad Ibn Yahia Ibn Habban reported that two men from the "Achja" tribe, said that Muhammad Ibn Maslama Al-Ansari, when going to collect zakat, he said to the debtor: "Select the zakat of your property". He did not refuse a sheep which its owner thought was an acquittal of what he owed”. Malek said: "What was followed in Medina, and what I have heard from learned men, is not to coerce Muslims by demanding zakat from them and to accept them, everything well, that they handed over. Chapter XVII Of alms, and of those entitled to them.
(604) 30 • Ata Ibn Yassar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “Alms are not permitted to the rich , it is actually for five people: a fighter in the way of Allah, a beggar for alms, a man in debt, a man who buys it with his own money, and a man with a poor neighbor to whom alms have been given, which will be given by the latter, to the rich man”. Malek said: "What is followed, in the distribution of alms, is that it is done according to the choice of the governor, according to even his forecast, so he can give to one of the people, mentioned above. above, according to his need, and as much as the governor judges it; a year or two later, he will give to other people, always considering what is necessary for them; that's what the scholars were happy to do,” Malek said. On the other hand, those who work for alms, says Malek, are only entitled to a specific percentage, unless the governor goes to apply any standard other than necessity”. Chapter XVIII The quest for alms and the insistence on covering them
(605) 31 - Malek reported that Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq said: "If men refuse to give me zakat, I will fight against them, to get it".
(606) 32 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab drank milk which he found good; he asked the man who gave it to him to drink, the origin of this milk? He told him that he was near a spring, and mentioned his name, he met a herd of animals, whose zakat was due, which was drinking. He asked for a drink, they gave him some milk, which he took and filled his skin. Then Omar, put his hand in his mouth, and vomited what he had already drunk». Malek said: "Whoever refuses the fulfillment of one of the prescriptions, imposed by Allah and which the Muslims could not follow, they will have every right, to fight against this man until he given".
(607) 33 - It was reported to Malek that one of the prefects of Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz, wrote to him, which follows: "a man refused to fulfill the zakat of his property"; Omar, answered him in writing: “beware of him, and do not take part of his zakat, with the Muslims”. The man, made aware of what took place, fell into pain, and even became sickly; at this time, he hastened to pay his zakat; the prefect of Omar, let him know what is due to this man; Omar hardly protested and said, "Take this zakat." Chapter XIX On the estimated zakat of date and grape harvests
(608) 34 - Busr Ibn Sa'id reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "lands watered by rain and water channels, one pays a zakat which is equivalent to the tenth of the harvest; of those which are watered by water drawn from wells or through pumps, the zakat is half of a tenth”.
(609) 35 - Ziad Ibn Sa'id reported that Ibn Chehab said: one does not take zakat from bad quality dates, called "al-jou'rour"; neither "mousran-el-fara", nor "azq ibn houbaiq"; they are counted for their owner but without being subject to zakat”. Malek said, “this is to be compared with sheep, which are reckoned with goats, and these goats are not subject to zakat in any way. It is the same for some fruits of which some species are not designed for alms, for example "Al-Bourdi" (one of the best qualities of dates); thus one takes neither the good nor the bad. quality; one is in preference for what is of average quality”. Malek said: “The most esteemed fruits in Medina are dates and grapes, and that as soon as they are ripe and fit for sale. It is that the fruits of palm trees and vines are eaten as fresh dates and fresh grapes. They are valued as long as they are fruits in the trees, so that their owners will be at ease and no longer in embarrassment after this valuation; then the owners are left the right to dispose of it as they see fit, from the delivery of their alms according to what has been estimated. Malek said: “As for fruits which are not eaten fresh, but which are used after the harvest like cereals, they are not to be evaluated; but one leaves to their owners, and that after having harvested them, treated, winnowed, so that they become grains ready to be consumed, the whole confidence in their loyalty, to put back the alms in case the quantity piled up, in is due. And this subject is indisputable. Malek added, “What is followed in Medina is that, the palms are esteemed, while having their fruits on their trees; once these fruits ripen and are displayed for sale, zakat is due from the dates after cutting the bunches. If the palms are attacked by a plague after they have been estimated, and before the bunches are cut, and the plagues deprive the palms of all their fruits, the zakat is no longer due. If, among what remains, the quantity is five "Wasqs and beyond according to the "sa'" of the Prophet r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), the zakat is to be considered in this quantity and not in that which was lost. The same process is to be followed for the vineyards. If one owns in different places, or owns lots in common with others in such a way that the lot alone is not subject to zakat, but together, the whole becomes subject to zakat, that it must be paid”. Chapter XX The Zakat of Grains and Olives
(610) 36 - Malek reported that he inquired about the zakat of olives, near Ibn Chehab who answered him: "it is of the tenth". Malek said: “the zakat provided for the olive, is one tenth, but after pressing it, and the amount is five “Wasqs” and beyond; if it is less, the zakat is no longer entitled. And the olive trees are considered as the palm trees, concerning the watering: that the ground planted with olive trees is watered by the rain and the springs of water, the zakat, is there of the tenth; watered by water drawn from wells or others, it is half a tenth; for the olive trees, there is no need to estimate them, whereas the olives are always on the trees». As for the grains that people save to eat later, the zakat is one-tenth if the land is watered by rain or springs of water; it is half of a tenth if the watering is done by brought water. We must take into account that the weight is five "Wasqs" according to the "sa'" of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), Malek said, and always about the grains, that which is subject thereto are the following genera: wheat, barley, soult (kind of barley), maize, millet, rice, lentil, vetch, bean, sesame and other genera similar to them, and are for food use. However, the zakat, provided for these grains, is due, once they are harvested and shelled. And, people are payable this zakat, and we accept from them everything they give”. And, Malek was asked the time, when the zakat of the olives, which is either a tenth or a half of the second, is to be paid; is it before or after the maintenance fee reduction? He answered: “one does not have to consider the expenses which the owners take care of, just like the case of the food and one is only interested in what is declared. He, in whom the weight of the olives is five “Wasqs” and beyond, the zakat is one tenth of the oil, after the olive has been pressed; if the weight is less, the zakat is not due”. Malek said, “Whoever sells his crop of grain after it has become dry, unscathed and kept in its husks, has to pay the zakat himself, not the buyer. And the grains can only be sold after they have dried up in their envelopes, and without them still needing water, to water them”. Malek said, "for the verse: 'Pay the duties on the day of harvest' Quran VI, 141, interpreting it: it is about zakat, which is to be paid, and it says -he, "which I have heard of many". Malek finally said: “He who sells his garden, or his land, which yields crops, or fruit trees, but, at the time when the fruits are not edible, it is up to the buyer to pay the zakat. In case the fruits have become edible, the seller owes this zakat unless it suits the buyer”. Chapter XXI Fruits exempt from zakat.
(611) 37 - Malek said: "for the man, who, after picking or harvesting, obtains only four Wasqs of dates, or four Wasqs of raisins, or four Wasqs of wheat, or four Wasqs of mealy grains , he will not have to put everything together, for it to be subject to zakat; because this is payable when the weight of any species, namely, dates, raisins, wheat, or floury grains, is five Wasqs, according to the "sa'" of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and in accordance with the words of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): “for less than five Wasqs , zakat is not payable. In case, any species, previously mentioned, has a weight of five Wasqs, zakat is payable, if the weight is less, zakat is not. For more precision, suppose that the man picked five Wasqs of dates, and that independently of their gender and color; he will have to collect everything and then pay the zakat; if the weight is less than five, zakat is not paid. It is the same for wheat, brown or white, for barley, vetch, all are considered as a single species that man must gather to pay zakat if the weight is five Wasqs or more. five Wasqs; and if it is less than five, zakat is not payable. As for raisins where one has black and red, which, being picked, and their weight is five Wasqs, the man has to pay zakat. If the weight is less than five, zakat is not payable. As for floury grains, they are all considered as a single species, just like wheat, dates and raisins without underlining their names or colors. Grains are said to be: peas, lentils, beans and vetches, and all that is considered by people to be floury grains. (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) of all these grains, mixed together without distinguishing the species, he must combine them to pay the zakat, if it is due) Malek said: "And Omar Ibn Al-Khattab distinguished between mealy grains and wheat, when he collected zakat from the Nabataeans; he considered that all floury grains constitute a single species and took from them, the tenth for zakat, and half of the tenth of wheat and dates, always for zakat. Malek added, “If one protests saying, how to accept, the coming together of different kinds of floury grains so that the total is subject to zakat, and therefore the man can exchange from hand to hand a measure of one of these kinds for two of another, when this exchange cannot in any case take place, from hand to hand, for two measures of one kind of wheat for two of a different kind? The answer was as follows: “gold and silver are joined together in order to pay zakat, and one can, on the other hand, exchange one dinar for several multiples of silver from hand to hand”. Malek said: “As for the palm trees which are owned between two men, and who pick eight Wasqs of dates, they don't have to pay zakat. If one of them picks five Wasqs, and the other four or less and the picking is from the same land, it is to the first that zakat is due, as for the other he is exempt. It is the same case for the associates, in the harvest of the grains obtained after the harvest, or of the dates after their cutting, or of the grape after its picking. If each of them will have five Wasqs of cut dates, or picked grapes, or mown grains, he must pay zakat on them; for the one whose share is less than five Wasqs, he is exempt from zakat, which will be paid by the one whose share is five Wasqs, and more”. Malek said: "What is followed in Medina is that for the man who has paid his due for zakat of different kinds of wheat, dates, raisins, and grains, then that he retains them for a few years, after which he will sell them, the zakat is only entitled to be paid after the lapse of one year, from the day the sale took place, because this is considered for usufruct or other and no longer for trade. This is to be considered just like food, store of grain and commodities which man can keep for a number of years in order to sell them later for gold and silver; in this case, he will only have to pay the zakat after one year has elapsed, from the very day on which the sale took place. But if these species are intended as articles of commerce, their owner must perform zakat on them, when he sells them, if he had kept them for one year, after paying zakat on the day he had already bought them. . Chapter XXII Of what is not subject to zakat, fruits, vegetables and cereals Malek said: is that not all fruits are subject to zakat such as pomegranates, plums, figs and the like, of all fruits. The same is true for vegetables and cereals, where there is no zakat until one year has elapsed from the day of their sale and the collection of the price”.

The Syrians insisted on the zakat, to Oubaidallah, who wrote back to Omar, whose response was: "If it satisfies them, take the zakat, and return theirs, offering it to their slaves". And Malek recalls that the slaves were understood to be the poor”.
(614) 40 - Abdallah Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm reported: "My father, being in Mina, received from Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz a letter, which said, not to take zakat neither for honey, nor for horse.

And that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had perceived it from the Magi of “Persia” and Osman Ibn Affan, from the “Berbers”.
(617) 43 - Ja'far Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ali reported from his father, that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab, alluding to the Magi, said, "I don't know how to behave with them"? Abdel-Rahman Ibn Auf replied: "I testify that I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say: "To treat them as the People of the Book" .
(618) 44 - Aslam, the slave of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab reported: "Omar Ibn Al-Khattab charged tax, the owners of gold, for a value of four dinars, as well as to those of money as forty dirhams. This was for the benefit of the Muslims to help them, and to be hospitable to travellers”.
(619) 45 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that his father said to Umar Ibn Al-Khattab: “Among the mounts there is a blind camel”; Omar to answer: “To give it to a poor family to use it”; I replied, "but she is blind"; He retorted: "Let it be treated with tar"; I answered: “How then, can she feed on the grass”?. Omar asked, "Is it tax goods or zakat goods"? "She's tax goods" I said. “By Allah, said Omar, you want to eat his flesh”. - She has the tax mark,” I said. Omar then gave the order, to kill him, and he had nine dishes, which were well filled with fruits and other foods; he sent these dishes to the wives of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) the last of which was given to Hafsa, the daughter of Omar, for the good reason that, if his dish had for content, which is less than in the others, he will consider that as his part. He put in these dishes, flesh of the camel and sent them to the wives of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and with what remains, he made a meal, to what, he invited the Monhajirines and the Ansars”. Malek said, "I foresee that one should only take from the tributaries what they owe as taxes."
(620) 46 - It was reported to Malek, that Omar Ibn Abdel Aziz had written to his governors: "To remit the taxes to the tributaries who have embraced Islam". Malek said, “It is sunna not to impose tax on the wives of the People of the Book, nor on their children, and let it be obligatory for pubescent men. On the other hand, the capitation is not collected from those who are protected by the Muslims, nor from the Magi, for what they possess of properties such as palm trees, vines, plantations, herds, because, the alms was in principle wanted from Muslims, only in order to purify them, and to give it to the poor, And this poll tax was imposed on the People of the Book to humiliate them, they owed no tribute in their countries. on their own goods, because they concluded a pact of submission, that if they make commercial transactions in the countries of the Moslems, which is besides their end, one perceives the tenth of their transactions. Moreover, the poll tax was imposed on them, and they accepted it, so that they would remain in their country and defend it against the enemy. If one of them leaves his country for another where he will trade, he owes a tenth of his transactions. It is the same for those who are from Egypt and who leave for Syria, those from Syria for Iraq, those from Iraq for Medina, or for Yemen or other countries (Muslims), all have to pay the tenth. It is tradition that the People of the Book have no zakat, as well as the Magi, in their goods, their herds, their fruits and their plantations. They can even keep their religions, without being obliged to deny them. But, as long as they have to do business in Muslim countries, they must pay the tenth of their transactions, because this does not form a clause of the pact which they concluded, nor a favor which was granted to them. This is what I have seen, applied by the Ulemas of Medina”. Chapter XXV The tithe collected from those who enjoy the protection of the Muslims.
(621) 47 - Salem Ibn Abdallah reported from his father that Omar Ibn Al-Khatab, took from the Nabataeans, half of a tenth of their wheat and their oil, wanting to increase by this, these products in Medina. As for floury grains, he took the tenth”.

(624) 50 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that his father heard Umar Ibn Al-Khattab say: “I gave alms of a purebred horse to a man, to fight in the way of Allah. The man, with whom the horse was, had badly taken care of it; so I wanted to buy it myself at a good price. I asked, on this subject the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) who answered me: “Do not buy it, even at the cost of a dirham, because, the one who returns on his alms, is to be compared to the dog which returns on his vomit”.

Malek was asked about a man who gave alms, who soon after found himself with someone other than the one to whom it was given, and what the latter wanted to sell; could he afford it? He answered: “I prefer that it be abandoned”. Chapter XXVII Those for whom the zakat of fitr is payable.

As for those who are not Muslims, zakat is not payable on them”. Malek continued, “As for the runaway slave, whether or not his boss knows his place, and his absence is for a short time, in the hope of his return and his life, I conceive that he pays the zakat of the fitr about her. In case, where there is no more hope for his return, and his absence is long, this zakat is not to be paid”. And Malek who adds: “the zakat of the fitr is an obligation on the Bedouins and the townspeople; for the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) has prescribed it on everyone, whether he is a free man or a slave, of a male or a female, as Muslims”.

Malek said: “Whoever, being on a journey, and knowing that he will return to his family on the first of the month of Ramadan, and that dawn surprised him before he returned, he must return while being fasting” Malek also said: “Whoever intends to travel during the month of Ramadan, and the dawn appeared, while he is still at home, he must fast on this day”. Malek said: "Whoever returns from a trip while he is not fasting, and his wife is likewise, following the cessation of her menses in the month of Ramadan, he can, if he wants, have carnal relations with her”.

The man replied, "I can't do either." At that time, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was brought a basket containing dates; he said to the man: “Take this, in order to give alms” He answered him: “no one needs it. more than me". The Apostle of Allah (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) laughed, so much that his fangs appeared, and said to the man, "Eat it then."
(661) 30 • Sa'id Ibn AI Musaiab reported that a Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) beating his chest, pulling her hair and saying, "I'm lost." The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) asked him: "what is the matter with you"? “I have just had carnal intercourse with my wife while I am fasting in the month of Ramadan,” replied the man. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: “Are you capable of freeing a slave? No”, answered the man. “Can you sacrifice a camel”? - "No" answered the man. "Sit down, then"; one brought, to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) at this moment a basket of dates; he gave it to the man saying to him, "Take this and give it as alms." The Bedouin says: “No one needs it more than me”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "eat it, but fast for a day to expiate what you have committed". -Ata asked Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab: "what was the weight of the dates contained in this basket"? He replied: "A matter of fifteen to twenty sa's." Malek said, "I have heard versed men say, 'He who, for carnal intercourse with his wife, or for any other reason, breaks a day of fasting in the month of Ramadan, will not have to make atonement, as moreover, it was mentioned by the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) about the one who has already had intercourse during the day; but he will have to compensate on that day, in other months of the year”. That's the best I've heard said about it. Chapter X He who in a fasting state practices bloodletting.

(664) 33 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father allowed himself to be bled while fasting, then did not suspend his fast». And he said, "And I only saw him do that when he was fasting." Malek said, “It is frowned upon to bloodletting the fasting person, for fear that he will grow weak; and apart from that cause, it is not to be refused. But if a man wants to do it without it weakening him, there is no harm in it, and I don't find that he should fast on any other day, except the month of Ramadan, because this bloodletting is considered valid cause for breaking the fast, if it weakens it. Whoever wants to do a bloodletting while fasting, and intends to be such until the evening, there is no harm in that, and he will not have to compensate with another day”. Chapter XI Fasting on the day of Achoura.
(665) 34 - Ourwa reported that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "The day of Ashura, was a day of fasting for the Qoraishites, in the pre-Islamic period, and it was the same, for the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and peace of Allah). And when the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) was in Medina and the day of Ashura arrived, he fasted it, and ordered that we the young. But when the fast of Ramadan was prescribed, it was considered the only fast that should be followed, and the fast of the day of Achoura was suspended, leaving people the freedom to fast it”.
(666) 35 - Houmaid Ibn Abdel-Rahman Ibn Awf reported that he heard Mu'awia Ibn Abi Sufian, the year he made the pilgrimage, say, on the day of Ashura, while being in the pulpit: "O Medinan! where are your versed men? I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say, concerning this day: “It is the day of Ashura, and Allah will not did not prescribe it, fast day. For me, I fast it, for you others, you can fast it or not”.
(667) 36 - It was reported to Malek, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab sent word to Al-Hareth Ibn Hisham: "Tomorrow is the day of Ashura, fast it and order your family to do the same". Chapter XII Of the fast of the two days the fitr and al-adha, and of the omnitemporal fast.
(668) 37 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbade fasting on both days of fitr (suspension of fasting) and of al-adha (the day of the sacrifice).
(669) 38 - Malek reported that he has heard learned men say, "There is no harm in fasting continuously, but except fasting for the two days he has moreover, it was forbidden to fast, namely the day of fitr, and that of al-adha; this is what has come down to us”. Malek added: this is my favorite thing”. Chapter XIII On the prohibition of continuous fasting (for two days that follow)
(670) 39 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), has forbidden to follow the fast for two continuous days”.

(671) 40 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Take care to fast for two days in a row, beware of fasting for two days in a row”! He was told: “but you, you are fasting, O Messenger of Allah”? He replied, “I am not like you; I sleep well fed and watered (by my Allah)”. Chapter XIV Of the fasting of one who, by mistake, commits murder or of one who compares his wife "to the back of his own mother".
(672) 41 - Malek said: "The best words I have heard about one who will fast for two months in a row, as an atonement, for not having, by mistake, killed another man or because of having compared his wife to his own mother's back in case he has a disease that requires him to break his fast, to have to postpone the fast until he is cured, and to resume the fast by holding count the days he has already fasted. It is the same for the woman who owes this fast, if by mistake, she kills a person, she has to suspend her fast during the period of her menses, then once purified, she resumes the fast without any delay in taking into account the days she has already fasted”. And there is no reason for one who has to fast for two months in a row - as mentioned in the Book of Allah - to break his fast except for a cause of illness, or for the question of menses; therefore, he must not travel so that he does not break his fast”. And Malek said, 'that's the best I've heard about it'. Chapter XV What the patient must do concerning his fast.
(673) 42 - Malek said: "What I have heard, say men versed in religion, about one who is afflicted with a disease, in such a way that his fast seems to him so painful, and tiring , until his condition becomes unbearable, that he can suspend his fast. It is the same for the sick person who cannot say his prayers on his feet because of his illness; and Allah knows better than anyone his condition, and the seriousness of his illness, therefore, he can pray while sitting, for the religion of Allah is to facilitate the practice”. On the other hand. Allah has allowed the traveler to break the fast, although he is much more capable of doing so than the sick. Allah, The Most High has said in his Book: “Whoever of you is sick, or who travels, will then fast an equal number of days”. Koran II, 184. Allah, therefore, has tolerated for the traveler, the breaking of the fast, although he is much more capable than the sick person of fasting”. This is what I heard from God, and this is what is traditionally followed”. Chapter XVI Of the vow to fast and fasting on behalf of the dead.
(674) 43 - Sa'id Ibn Musaiab was asked about a man, who took a vow to fast for a month. Can he fast on other days (as a supererogation)? He replied, "Let the vow be performed first, and then fast other fasts." Malek said: “It was the same opinion of Suleiman Ibn Yassar”. Malek said, "Whoever dies before carrying out a vow to free a slave, or perform a supererogatory fast, or pay the zakat of a camel, and which he stipulates in his will, his successor must execute it in inheritance, and which is equivalent to a third of what the man has bequeathed; and this is to be considered as a priority, of all other stipulations unless there is such a thing. Because of all that he has done as a vow or otherwise, nothing is obligatory, and is not even to be considered as a supererogatory act which can only be taken from a third of what he has bequeathed, without touching in the capial. If this had been allowed to him, the dead would have delayed this until the moment when death presents itself to him and the goods will go to his successors, he will have designated all these things that no one has the right to claim them except d 'after a dispute brought to justice and in this way, this death could designate all this until the moment when death, presenting itself to him to dispose of all his capital, which he will not have the right to do' .
(675) 44 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Umar was often asked "Is it permissible for a man to fast for another, or pray for another." He replied: “No one can fast or pray in place of another”. Chapter XVII Of fasting on days other than Ramadan and of their expiation.
(676) 45 - Khaled Ibn Aslam reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, suspended his fast on a day of Ramadan, as the sky was cloudy, and believing that the sun had disappeared. A man came and said to him: “O prince of believers! The sun has appeared”; Omar answered: "what I have just done is not serious, and I only made the application of my own lights". And Malek, wanting to explain the above said: “Omar, designate by “it does not matter”, that he intends to compensate for the day when the fast was broken, by another, because it is only a question of a single day which is so easy to fast". And Allah is most knowledgeable about this.”
(677) 46 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "Whoever must fast for several days in compensation for other days of broken fasts in Ramadan, for causes of illness or travel, he must fast for one uninterrupted way”.
(678) 47 - Ibn Chehab reported that Abdallah Ibn Abbas and Abu Huraira had a dispute about compensation for the fast, for breaking it for a few days in Ramadan. One said to himself: “He must fast them consecutively, the other: he can fast them separately”. The reporter added: “I don't know which of them said: 'He can fast them separately'.
(679) 48 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: “Whoever vomits voluntarily, while fasting, must fast another day. As for the one who cannot hold back his vomit, he can dispense”.
(680) 49 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab ask about compensation for fasting”. He replied: “If a man has to fast a few days, to compensate for others in the month of Ramadan, I prefer that he fast them, without interruption”. Yahia reports that he heard Malek say, “He who fasts several days in order to compensate for other days of the fasting month, by separating them, must not do them again without interruption; what he has done is sufficient, although I prefer that the compensated fast be done without interruption”. Malek said: “Whoever by mistake or forgetfulness, in Ramadan or even, during a compensated fast, goes to eat or drink, he must fast on other days by acquittal”.
(681) 50 - Malek reported that Houmaid Ibn Qais Al-Makki related to him: "I was with Mujahed, in a processional tour around the Ka'ba, when a man came to ask him about the fasting of the days of atonement, whether they are to be done without interruption or separately? Houmaid replied, "Surely he can separate them by fasting." But Mujahed added: “He must, fast them without interruption, because according to the recitation of Ubai Ibn Ka'b, they must be three days in a row”. Malek added: “It is better that they fast continuously, as revealed by Allah in the Quran.” Malek was asked about a woman who, while fasting in Ramadan, had a discharge of blood in the morning, without it being her period, then waited until the evening to see if she would be in such a state. , but she doesn't see any of that. Then the next morning, she will have a flow, less than the first, which stops even before a few days of her menses, what should this woman do and for her fasting and her prayer”? He replied, “This flow is due to menstruation, so she must break her fast, and will have to compensate for these days later after the month of fasting. Once her menses stop let her make her lotion and fast”. Malek was asked about a man who just on the last day of Ramadan converted to Islam. Should he fast only on the day of his conversion to Islam, or every day of this month? He answered: “He does not have to fast the days that have passed, by way of compensation; but he must fast the days that follow them, although I prefer that he fast on the day he converted to Islam”. Chapter XVIII Of the acquittal of voluntary fasting.
(682) 51 - Ibn Chehab reported that Aisha and Hafsa, the wives of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) I (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) were fasting voluntarily, when, in the morning, they were presented , food, they broke their fast. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) entering their home, Aisha said: "Hafsa, who looked like his father (Umar) took the initiative and asked the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): “O, Messenger of Allah, I was fasting voluntarily, with Aicha, when, having received food , we broke our fast”? He replied, "Fast by substitution another day." Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: "Whoever, doing a voluntary fast, has, by mistake or forgetfulness, eaten or drunk, may continue his fast for the rest of the day without being obliged to fast another day. Thus, one who fasts voluntarily and who breaks his fast for any reason, will not have to fast another day; for the breaking of the fast is due to a valid cause without it being by his will. On the other hand, the one who makes a voluntary prayer and who accidentally becomes impure, in such a way that he must redo his ablutions to continue his prayer, can dispense with this prayer”. Malek added: "It is not suitable for a man who, practicing religious works (al-amal as-saliha) of those which are obligatory such as prayer, pilgrimage, fasting and any other worship practice, then perform them as supererogatory works, not performing them as obligations, when he does them as supererogatory as in the case where, he does takbir without performing the two raka'ts, likewise the voluntary fast which he breaks before evening, he makes the talbiat of the pilgrimage and returns home before he completes it, finally he makes the processional rounds (Tawaf) before completing the seven rounds. It is unseemly for him to omit a rite before he performs it to perfection, unless something happens to him which constrains him such as illness and other valid excuse. For Allah Most High said in his Book: “Eat and drink until one can distinguish at dawn a white thread from a black thread. Then fast until nightfall. Koran II, 187. Man must fast. Allah also said: "Do for Allah the small and the great pilgrimage" (Koran 11,196). If a man makes the talbiat of a voluntary Hajj when he has completed the obligatory pilgrimage, he is not allowed to leave his irham before he completes his pilgrimage. And any man beginning a supererogatory work, must complete it, as if it were a prescribed obligation. That's the best interpretation I've heard about it." Chapter XIX On the redemption of one who does not fast in Ramadan, for a valid cause
(683) 52 - Malek reported that Anas Ibn Malek, paid the fidya (he redeemed himself) when he reached old age, and could no longer fast. Malek added: “I don't find it mandatory and I would prefer him to fast if he is able to. Because the one who redeems himself, must give to eat, for each day to the poor, a mud of food according to the mud of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah).
(684) 53 - Abdallah Ibn Omar was asked about the pregnant woman who fears for her fetus, if fasting causes her weakness? He replied: "Let her stop fasting and feed the poor, for each day, a mudd of wheat which is equivalent to the mudd of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of 'Allah)". Malek said: “The well-earned men provide that she must fast other days as compensation, in accordance with the words of Allah to Him the power and the glory: “Whoever of you is sick or travels, then shall fast an equal number of days. Coran II, 184. They consider that her pregnancy and her fear of her child are only a disease”.
(685) 54 - Abdel Rahman Ibn al-Kassem reported that his father said: "Whoever was supposed to fast for a few days and he did not, until the advent of the following Ramadan, he must give , for each day, to eat with the poor, a moudd of wheat, by fasting what it owes of days”. (...) 55 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Joubair was of the same opinion». Chapter XX Of the acquittal of the fast.
(686) 56 - Abu Salama Ibn Abdel-Rahman reported that he heard Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say: "I used to duty of fasting days in the month of Ramadan, and I could only fast them in the month of Sha'ban". Chapter XXI Of the fast of the day that one doubts.
(687) 57 - Malek heard, men versed in religion, prohibit fasting on the day of doubt in the month of Cha'ban, if one intends to consider it the first day of Ramadan. And, they considered that the one who will have fasted it without the vision of the new moon (of Ramadan) following which, one comes to assure that it is, in fact, the first day of Ramadan, he must fast it on another day, and they find no harm in fasting that day as supererogatory”. And Malek adds: "This is what is our traditions, and which was also followed in Medina". Chapter XXII Fasting and its merit.
(688) 58 - Abu Salama Ibn Abdel Rahman reported that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “The Messenger of Allah ( salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) fasted so much that it was said that he did not break the fast, and ate what it was said that he did not fast. And I have never seen the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace of Allah and the peace of Allah) fast for a whole month except in Ramadan. His voluntary fast was often done in the month of Sha'ban.
(689) 59 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: “Fasting is protection. If any of you is fasting, let him not speak indecently, let him not commit unseemly acts; if anyone insults or attacks him, let him say: “I am fasting, I am fasting”.
(690) 60 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "By him who holds my soul in his hand, the the smell of the mouth of the fasting person is more fragrant with Allah than the smell of musk. He discarded his desire, his food and his drink for Me. Fasting belongs to Me and I give the reward. Any good deed will be multiplied tenfold and can go up to seven hundred multiples; as for the fast, it belongs to Me and it is I who will fix the reward”.
(691) 61 - Abu Huraira said: "When it is the month of Ramadan, the gates of Paradise open, the gates of Hell close, and the demons are chained".
(692) 62 - Malek heard, the men versed in the religion, not to prohibit the use of the siwak (rubs teeth made of a branch of a wood of "arrak") in the month of Ramadan, during the day, neither at its beginning nor at its end. And, none of them repelled him. On the question of the six-day fast, (ie, Shawwal) following the month of Ramadan, Malek said: “That he saw no ulema and no religiously educated man fasting them; and he was not even informed of this question by a predecessor. Even, men used to shy away from it lest the ignorant and the common people attribute to the month of Ramadan, which is unfit and strange to it, which will be an innovation, especially if they argue by the permission of versed men in religion”. Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "I have never heard any of the men versed in religion, neither of those who are learned, nor of those who are followed, prohibit the fasting of the day of Friday; and his fasting is beneficial; I even saw some of them fasting for it while looking for it». MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 19 The spiritual retreat Chapter one The spiritual retreat.
(693) 1 Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “When the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was doing the spiritual retreat, he held out his head to me in order to clean it and comb it. And he only came home for the satisfaction of a natural need.
(694) 2 - Amra Bint Abdel-Rahman reported: “when Aicha was doing the retreat, she asked for news of the sick while walking, without stopping”. Malek said: “He who makes a spiritual retreat, should not attend to any personal business, nor go out to find him, nor help anyone in any work, but he can only leave the mosque for the satisfaction of his soul. a natural need. And if he were allowed to go out, from the place of retreat, he could visit a sick person, or follow a funeral procession and pray over a dead person». And Malek added: "He who makes itikaf is only said in itikaf if he abstains from avoiding what a man who does not make this retreat must occupy, namely to visit a sick person, follow a funeral procession by making the funeral prayer, and satisfying a natural need by entering his home".
(695) 3 - Malek asked Ibn Chehab about the man who is in retreat, is it permissible for him to enter a covered place for the satisfaction of a need? He replied, "Yes, there is nothing wrong with that." Malek said, “What is indisputable is that there is no harm in performing itikaf in any mosque where Friday services are held. The aversion is that the moutakif (in spiritual retreat) leaves the mosque where he was doing his retreat, for another where the Friday prayer is performed, or that he neglects it. If it is a mosque where the common Friday prayer is not performed, and the one who makes his retreat there is not obliged to leave it for another mosque where the Friday prayer is performed, I find no harm in this, for Allah the Blessed and the Most High has said (meaning): "When you are in retreat in the mosque" Quran II, 187. And Allah, has, in this verse mentioned all the mosques, without any particularity”. And Malek said: "thus, it is concluded that it was permissible for the man to make his retreat in the mosque where the Friday service was not held, and could not leave this mosque to go in the one where Friday prayers were held?. Malek also said: “The pensioner will only spend the night in the mosque where he had made his retreat unless it is in one of the courtyards of this mosque. And I never heard that the pensioner will put up a tent where he will spend his night; because he had to stay in the mosque or in one of its courts”. And what shows that the retiree was to spend the night only in the mosque, are the words of Aisha: “When the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was in a spiritual retreat, he only returned home to satisfy a natural need”. On the other hand, one should not make the retreat either on the roof of a mosque, or in its turret”. Malek added: "the retiree enters the place he has chosen to be the place of his spiritual retreat and this before sunset, of the first night when he has decided to begin his retreat so that he be ready to receive his first night, while being in retreat, without being preoccupied with any other business such as trade or the like. There is no harm in him entrusting others with his affairs concerning his own property or that of his family, even allowing them to sell what he has, or something else that does not require his intervention. There is no harm in him entrusting a third person with taking care of all this”. Malek adds: "I have never heard anyone of the men versed in religion, underline a precise condition to make the spiritual retreat, because, this is none other than one of the religious practices like prayer, fasting , pilgrimage and other similar practice, in short, whether prescribed or supererogatory. Thus, whoever decides to exercise such a practice, must follow the predecessors without involving an innovation that Muslims have not made, nor imposing something on others or on himself. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) made this retreat and the Muslims knew how it should be practiced”. Malek finally concluded that the retreat and the stay in the mosque are similar and can be practiced by a city dweller and a Bedouin, in the same way”. Chapter II Of what cannot be neglected as a religious obligation in the spiritual retreat (itikaf).
(696) 4 - It was reported to Malek, that Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad and Nafe', the freedman of Abdallah Ibn Omar, said: "No spiritual retreat is feasible, without fasting", and this by reference to the words of Allah the Blessed and the Most High (meaning): “Eat and drink until one can distinguish at dawn a white thread from a black thread. Then fast until nightfall. Do not have any relation with your wives when you are in retirement in the mosque” Koran II, 187. Allah, has, in this verse, mentioned the retirement with the fast”. Malek said: "It is, moreover, what we have followed, that there is no retreat except with fasting". Chapter III The exit of the retired moutakif to attend the party.
(697) 5 - Soumai the freedman of Abou Bakr Ibn Abdel-Rahman reported that Abou Bakr Ibn Abdel-Rahman, being in his spiritual retreat, went out to do his natural need under a roof in a closed room, in the residence of Khalid Ibn Al-Walid. He only returned to his family to attend the feast prayer with the Muslims”.
(698) 6 - Malek reported that he saw the men versed in religion, making their spiritual retreat in the last decade of Ramadan, and returning home, only to attend the prayer of the feast of fitr with people". Malek added: “It was also told to me, about the virtuous men who preceded us; and that's my favorite thing I've heard". Chapter IV Payment of retirement.
(699) 7 - Aisha reported: "Wanting to make his spiritual retreat (itikaf), the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) went to the place of his retreat, and he was surprised by the presence of the tents erected, among others, the tent of Aicha, and that of Hafsa. Seeing them, he went to find out, and they said to him: "This is the tent of Aisha, this other of Hafsa, and finally that of Zainab". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "Do you believe that you are doing a pious work by this?"; then he left the place without beginning his retreat, and made it later in a decade of the month of Shawwal”. Malek was asked, about a man who went to the mosque, for the spiritual retreat in the last decade of the month of Ramadan; he remained there for a day or two, then fell ill, and left the mosque. Should he make the retreat for what remains to him of the ten days, if he is cured, or is he exempted”? Malek replied, “He has to pay the remaining days of the retreat, if he is healed in Ramadan, or even after, if that month has ended. And I was told that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) wanted to do a spiritual retreat in the month of Ramadan, then he returned without the accomplish, so that once that month was over, he went on his ten-day retreat in the month of Shawwal. On the other hand, the one who, voluntarily makes a spiritual retreat, and the one who has to discharge it, are similar concerning their ritual to follow, or non-ritual. And I have not been told that the voluntary service of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) concerning the spiritual retreat was only supererogatory”. About the woman, who was doing her spiritual retreat, during which she had her menstrual period, Malek said, “She has to break her retreat and go home; she will make her purification lotion, and will be at the mosque again as soon as she has purified herself; thus, she will continue, the days that remain to her of her retirement taking into account the days of her menses. It is the same case of a woman, who has to fast for two successive months; having her period, she will purify herself and then continue her fast, considering the days she had already fasted; and it is better that it does not delay them”.
(700) 8 - Ibn Chehab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) during his retreat, went to his house, in case he had a need to be satisfied”. Malek said: “Who is in spiritual retreat (itikaf) does not have to come out of his retreat, so that he follows the funeral procession of his parents or others”. Chapter V Marriage during spiritual retreat. Malek said: “There is nothing to prevent entering into a marriage during the spiritual retreat, provided that there are no carnal relations; the same is true for retired women, who can be asked to marry, without there being any cohabitation. The pensioner is forbidden to have relations with his wife, both during the night and during the day”. And Malek added: “It is forbidden for a retired man to touch his wife, or even kiss her. And I did not hear, prohibit a woman and a retired man from concluding a marriage, as long as there are no carnal relations; at this time, it is to be prohibited. All the same, nothing prevents the faster from concluding a marriage during his fast. On the other hand, there is a distinction to be made between the marriage concluded by a man in retirement, and that which is made by a man in Ihram. The latter can eat, drink, visit a sick person, attend funeral processions, but does not wear perfume. On the other hand, women and men on retreat (itikaf) can anoint themselves, perfume themselves, and comb their hair, but hardly attend funeral processions, do not pray over the dead, and do not visit an illness. Thus the conditions of marriage differ from one to another, and this is what is traditionally followed for the question of marriage for the one who is in the state of Ihram, to the one who is in itikaf, and ultimately to the fasting person.

Amra added, “Aisha replied, 'It's not like Ibn Abbas said; myself, I braided with my own hands the garlands of the sacrificed animal of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), then to his in turn he put them around the animal's neck, and he sent it to be guarded by my father.

Malek was asked about a man who himself brings his offering by bleeding it and adorning it in Zul-Houlaifa, without being in a state of ihram until he arrives in Al -Johfa? He replied, "I don't like it, and I don't think that man has followed what is traditional, for it is not permissible to do that except to a man who adorns his beast for sacrifice, in him bleeding during the talbiat, and who does not intend to make the pilgrimage, and in this case he sends him and stays with his people". Malek was also asked, about the man who brings the beast victim without him being in the state of ihram yet”? He replied, "There is nothing wrong with that." And he was asked again for the question of the man who does not want to perform either the pilgrimage or the pious visitation; should he be in a state of ihram to adorn the sacrificed beast, because this matter has created a debate among people”? He replied, "We shall have to follow the hadith narrated by Aisha, the mother of the believers, where it is said that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had sent his sacrificed beast and then he remained without forbidding himself from the things that Allah made lawful for him until the beast was sacrificed”.

Al-Dahaq Ibn Qais said: "It will only be done by one who is ignorant of the order of Allah to Him the power and glory”. Sa'd to reply: “it is not correct what you have just said, o son of my brother”. al-Dahaq answered him: "Now, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab forbade it"; Sa'd continued: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), has done this, and we have accomplished it with him".
(772) 64 - Sadaqa Ibn Yassar reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: “By Allah! To make a pious visit and to offer a sacrifice before the pilgrimage, is more pleasing to me than to make a pious visit, following the pilgrimage in the month of “Zoul-Hijjà”.

And he will sacrifice the offering that is easy for him to have; if he does not find it, let him fast for three days during the pilgrimage, and seven when he returns home”. Malek interpreted this by saying, "If he resides in Makkah until the pilgrimage, and makes his pilgrimage in the same year." Malek, about a Meccans who leaves this city to reside elsewhere, then returns to make a pious visit during the month of the pilgrimage and remains in Mecca, from where he will begin the pilgrimage - said: "this man will have enjoyed of a normal life and should make the offering or fast if he has no offering, and so shall be considered a Makkan." Malek was asked about a man who is not a Makkan , but who went to Mecca for a pious visit during the month of pilgrimage and decided to stay there until making the pilgrimage. Will he be taken for a man who enjoys a normal life? He replied, “Yes, he will certainly have a normal life, but he is not considered a Meccan, even if he decides to stay there. And this, because he entered Mecca although he was not one of its inhabitants, and sacrifice and fasting are obligatory for those who are not Meccans. And this man wants to stay there, but he doesn't know if he can stay there with certainty, not being a Meccans.
(774) 66 Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab say: "He who pays a pious visit to the months of ChawaI, or Zoul-;Ki'da or Zoul-Hijja, then resides in Makkah until the pilgrimage takes place, he can enjoy a normal life in case he makes the pilgrimage. He will make the offering if it seems simple to him, or he will have to fast for three days during the pilgrimage and seven when he returns home”. Chapter XX Circumstances in which hajj at Tamattou is not obligatory
(775) 67 Malek said: "Whoever makes a pious visit in the months of Chawal, or Zul-Ki'da or Zul-Hijja, then returns to his own, and performs the same year the pilgrimage, will not have to make offering: because the offering is obligatory for the one who made a pious visit in the month of the pilgrimage then he remains (in Mecca) until the period of the pilgrimage, to perform it. And anyone who goes to Makkah from all over, to stay there, so that he makes the pious visit during the month of pilgrimage and then performs the pilgrimage, he is not held as one who enjoys 'a normal life; therefore, he does not have to make any sacrifice, nor to fast, and he is considered just like a Meccans if he lives in Makka during this period”. Malek was asked about a Meccans who left to be at the border, or for some other trip, then returned to Mecca, wanting to stay there, whether there were relatives or not; he entered Makkah to perform Umrah, and his pious visit was started from places which were determined by the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) or nearer than that. In this case, will he be like the one who enjoys a normal "tamattou" life? He replied, "He does not need to make an offering or fast like one who enjoys a normal life, for Allah the Blessed and the Most High has said in His Book (meaning): who does not have a family near the Sacred Mosque”.

And he has to make another pious visit, starting it, from the moment he missed the previous one, and to be in a state of ihram from the same place where he started his first missed pious visit, unless this place is a little further than the designated places; in this case he will put himself in a state of ihram from the place where he will begin his visit recovering the first”. - And Malek adds: “Whoever enters Mecca, to perform a pious visit, making the processional rounds around the Sacred House, and the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, while being in ritual impurity, or even without having performed ablution and then traded with his wife, and let him remember it,” Malek said, “Let him do lotion or his ablution, then come back to do the processional rounds again, as well as the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, then he performs a pious visit and sacrifices an offering. As for the woman, who had carnal intercourse with her husband, while she was in the state of ihram, she will act similarly to the man”. - Malek said finally: “The pious visit must be started from “Al-Tan'im”, the one who leaves the sacred precinct to be after in the state of ihram, this will be admitted if Allah wills; however, it has much more merit, to begin to make the talbiat from the very place that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had designated, or from another which is much further than Al-Tan'im”.

Then Abdallah, thinking about what he has done. says: "the pilgrimage and the pious visit are both the same duty".

Then he succeeded in gaining access to the Sacred House, completed the tawaf, finding that he had accomplished the rites, he sacrificed his victim”. Malek said: "This is what is traditionally followed, by one who is restrained by an enemy, just like the case of the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and his companions. As for the one who is retained in other conditions (or situations), he cannot be desacralized if he has not arrived at the Sacred House”.

He inquired about those who were near the water source, and met Abdallah Ibn Omar, Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair and Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam. Telling them what had happened to him, they all order him to remedy what he needs, and to make an offering. Once, feeling cured, he will have to make the pious visit then he will desacralize himself, waiting for the pilgrimage of the following year to accomplish it, and make the offering which seems easy to him». - Malek said: “this is what is, for us, traditionally followed, for the one who is prevented, for a cause other than that of the enemy. And Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, had ordered, Abou Ayoub Al-Ansari, and Habbar Ibn Al-Aswad, who missing the pilgrimage and arriving on the day of the sacrifice, to desecrate themselves after a pious visit, then to return home, still in state of desacralization. Then, the following year, they will have to make the pilgrimage and offer their victims; in case they cannot be found for them, they will have to fast for three days while on pilgrimage, and for seven days once they are at home”. Malek added, "one who is in a state of ihram and who will be inhibited from pilgrimage either through sickness, or other cause, or through mistaken counting of days, or through the invisibility of the crescent, being held as prevented, he will have to fulfill the same obligations as the prevented pilgrim". Malek was asked about a Meccans who made the talbiat for a pilgrimage, then suffered a fracture, or diarrhea, or that his wife had to give birth , what will he do"? He said: "Whoever is subject to these conditions is already taken for an impediment. Consequently, he will have to fulfill all the obligations which are applied to everyone" Malek said: "for the man, who arrives, in the months of the pilgrimage, to make the pious visit, who once this is finished, he will make the talbiat of the pilgrimage starting from Mecca, then that he undergoes a fracture or something that prevents him from being at the same station with the other people", "I think, he said, that he must persist until he is recovered, o where he will go out to the free territory and then return to Mecca, make the processional tour around the Sacred House, and the route between Al-Safa and al-Marwa, after which he will put himself out of the state of ihram. He will have to make the pilgrimage the following year and will offer a victim”. Malek was asked about the one who makes the talbiat for a pilgrimage from Mecca, then completes the processional tour around the Sacred House, and the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, after which he falls ill, and can't manage to be at the same station with people. Malek replied: "If this man missed the pilgrimage, if he succeeds, he will go out to the free territory, will enter for a pious visit, will make the processional tour around the Sacred House and the route between al-Safa and al-Marwa, for his first tour was not for a pious visitation. For this, he must complete the rites mentioned, and will make the following year, the pilgrimage and the offering is to be sent. But if he is not one of the inhabitants of Mecca, and he suffers from an illness that keeps him away from the pilgrimage, he makes the processional tour around the House and the route between Al-Safa and Al- Marva. Then he is in a state of ihram for a pious visitation, takes a processional tour around the House and the route between Al-Safa and al-Marwa, as his first tour and run was for pilgrimage only. The following year, he will have to make a pilgrimage and offer an offering”. Chapter XXXIII Of the construction of the Ka'ba.

Aisha replied, “O Messenger of Allah! Are you not going to rebuild it according to the foundations of Ibrahim”? He retorted: “if your fellow citizens were not so close to the time of polythesis, I would have done it”. Abdallah Ibn Umar added: “If Aisha had heard these words from the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) I do not think that the Messenger of Allah ( salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) would have neglected to touch the two Yemeni columns which directly follow the Black Stone. But the House has not been restored according to the foundations of Ibrahim”.

He replied: "No, you should not do so, because it is the tradition followed, to make two raka'ts once the seven rounds are completed". - Malek said about the man, who, distracted, will make eight or nine processional rounds, instead of seven, that he must break these rounds, if he is aware of the surplus, then make two raka'ts without taking into account the rounds made in addition. On the other hand, he does not have to consider the nine rounds already made after which he will make the prayer. Because he has to do two raka'ts every time seven rounds are completed”. Malek added: “Whoever doubts the number of his processional rounds, after having made two raka'ts, must start his rounds again to be sure of their exact number which is seven, then redo the two raka'ts. , because any prayer made will only be admitted if the seven rounds have been completed”. -Malek finally said: "Whoever accidentally suffers, which may make him impure, while making his processional rounds around the House, or even during the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, or between these two rites, in such a way that his rounds are almost partially or totally accomplished, and he has not yet made the two raka'ts, he must redo his ablutions, in order to continue his rounds and make his prayer.

When the prayer is finished, he will consider the number of rounds already made to complete them at seven. Then, he will not have to pray except just when the sun rises or sets”. And Malek added, "and if he wants to delay the prayer after sunset, he can do that." Malek finally said: “There is no harm in the man doing Tawaf after the dawn prayer, and that of the asr on the condition of making only seven rounds, and delaying the two raka'ts of the prayer, until the sun rises. Moreover, this is what Omar Ibn Al-Khattab did. He can delay them after the asr until sunset; the latter lying down, he can, if he wants, pray them, if not he can still delay them so that he can say the sunset prayer, and there, there is no harm”.

Allah will consider his pilgrimage accomplished. Malek finally said, "For the man who does not know that the last rite to be performed is the tour around the House, and he is unaware, that after leaving the holy places, I think that 'He won't have anything to do unless he's still very close to these places; then he must return to do the tour and then leave the Sacred House once the farewell tour has been completed”.

Then coming back to the House, and arriving at the door, I found myself impure again, so that I turned back and stayed at home until I was in purity; become pure, for the third time, here I am returning to the House, and again arriving at the door, the blood flowed.

He who makes the pilgrimage to the House or the pious visit does not commit a sin if he accomplishes the ritual circuits here and there” Koran II, v.158. Thus, the man is not to be judged, if he does not make the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa”. Aicha replied: “No, you misunderstood this verse; because if it were so, it would have been revealed in the following way: "It will not be a subject of offense, if the man does not make the course between these two localities". Continuing, Aicha said: "So this verse was revealed about the Ansars who were doing the talbiat at the name of "Manat" (worshipped statue) located in front of Koudaid and they were inconvenient to make the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. Being converts to Islam, they asked the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the favor and peace of Allah) about it.

Some said: “they must separate until the following year”. Sa'id says: “let them perform the rites of pilgrimage which they lack; end, let them return home.” If they are fit to make the pilgrimage the following year, let them perform it and make an offering. They will make the talbiat of the place where they had begun their ruined pilgrimage the previous year, and will separate until their pilgrimage is completed”. - Malek added: “They will come forward for an offering, a camel”. - Malek said about the man, who had intercourse with his wife, during the pilgrimage, when he was at a distance between the surge of Arafa and the throwing of the pebbles, "that he must offer a sacrifice, and make the following year a pilgrimage".

If there was one, he owes an offering in the same way”. - Malek finally said: “If the man ejaculates without having carnal intercourse (having thought or looked at his wife) he owes nothing. If the man kisses his wife without ejaculation, he only owes an offering. On the other hand, the woman with whom her husband had carnal intercourse, while she was making a pious visit or a pilgrimage, thereby obeying his orders, she owes an offering, and a subsequent pilgrimage, if these reports have took place either during the pilgrimage, or during a pious visit. She owes another pious visitation, making up for the wasted one, and an offering.” Chapter XLIX Of the offering of one who misses a pilgrimage.

We erred in counting, thinking that day was station day at Arafa! Omar answered him: “Go to Mecca, make with your companions, the processional rounds, and cut the throat of the offerings if you have some with you. Then shave, cut your hair and come home. As soon as the subsequent pilgrimage has arrived, make it and offer the offerings. If you cannot find them, fast for three days during the pilgrimage, and seven more when you are at home”.

He replied, “I think if he hasn't had intercourse with his wife, let him come back surging. But if he has had relations with his wife, let him come back to do the "tawaf el ifada", then let him make a pious visit and an offering. And it is not permissible for him to buy his offering from Mecca and slaughter it there.

Malek added: “This is what is most satisfying to me to have heard, for Allah the Blessed and Most High has said in His Book (meaning): “O you who believe! Do not kill game when you are in a state of sacredness. Whoever among you kills intentionally, will send to the Ka'ba, as compensation, an animal of his herd, equivalent to the game killed, according to the decision of two upright men among you. An equivalent reparation will still consist in feeding a poor person or in fasting” Koran V, 95. And of all that is considered as offerings of compensation, the sheep is among what Allah has called an offering. And this is indisputable, moreover, how can anyone doubt this? Any compensation that would not be a camel or a cow, should at least be a sheep; and if this compensation does not require a sheep, then one must redeem oneself by a fast or by the food of the poor”.

Abdallah Ibn Umar said to him: "For what has been cut from your hair, make an offering". A woman from Iraq asked him: “What must be his offering, O Abu Abdel-Rahman”? He wondered, "His offering"? "Yes," she said. Abdallah Ibn Omar retorted: "If I find only one sheep to immolate, that will be preferable to me than to fast".
(880) 176 Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: “A woman in the state of ihram when she leaves her ihram cannot comb her hair until she has cut a piece of the braids of her hair. And if she has an animal to sacrifice, she cannot cut her hair before she has immolated her sacrifice”.
(881) 177 - Malek reported that he heard some learned men say, “Man and woman should not associate for one offering (a cow or a camel); everyone must offer one”. Malek was asked about the one, to whom an offering was entrusted, to be immolated during a pilgrimage, the latter; will he be able to immolate, after having completed his pious visit Umrah or will he have to delay it until he completes his pilgrimage and desacralizes himself from his pious visit? He replied, "indeed, he must delay her so that he immolates her during the pilgrimage, and once he has desacralized himself from his pious visitation". Malek also said: "Whoever owes an offering in order to expiate a hunt, or owes such an offering for any other reason, his offering will only be sent to Makkah, and this is in accordance with the words of Allah Blessed and Most High (meaning) “He will send an offering to the Ka'ba”. But what is equivalent to the offering such as fasting or almsgiving, he can perform them outside of Mecca, where it seems good to him to perform them”.

Allah also said: the meaning "cohabitation with your wives is permitted to you during the night following the fast". Koran II, 187 . And evil is everything that has been slain on standing stones and it is Allah who knows more than anyone, for he also said the meaning: "And what through evil was sacrificed to other than Allah". Koran VI, 145. As for the disputes (jidel) during the pilgrimage, it is a fact that the Quraishites made a station near the sacred monument to Mouzdalifa in a place called Quzah, while the Arabs made the station at Arafa. They argued, some saying: “we are on the straight path”, others claiming, “no, it is rather we who are on the straight path”. “Allah Blessed and Most High, about them, said the meaning: “We have instituted a rite for each community; its members observe it. So let them not discuss with you the order received, Invoke your Lord You are on a straight path". Koran XXII, 67, 68. This is what disputes (jidel) refer to, which we consider as such and Allah is the most informed. This is what I I have heard of versed men.” Chapter LIV Of the various stations of man in a state of impurity and on his mount.

It is preferable for man to be ritually pure in performing these rites, and it is not becoming to him to be otherwise by doing it of his own free will.

If he has done this, his pilgrimage will be allowed. But if he is not in a state of ihram before the appearance of the dawn, he will be just like the man who missed his pilgrimage.

He replied, “As long as the Meccans were in Arafa and Mina, they would perform a two-raka't prayer, shortening the prayer until they returned to Mecca; and so it was with the prince of the pilgrimage, if he were a Meccan; he shortened the prayer in Arafa, and during the days of Mina.

Finally, he came out for the third time when the sun was gone, did the takbir and the people likewise did it, in such a way that this takbir being so high, he reaches the House. So we knew that Omar had come out to throw the stones. - Malek said: “What is traditional is that the takbir comes after the prayers. The first takbir is done by the imam and people accompany him after the noon prayer on the day of the sacrifice. As for the last, it is that of the imam in the company of the faithful. This takbir is after the dawn prayer, on the last day of the “tachrik”, after which this takbir ceases”. - Malek added: “Takbir, must be done by men as well as by women, on the days of the tachrik, whether one is in a group, or alone in Mina or elsewhere in any place. It is an obligation. And it is up to people to follow the imam of the pilgrimage, and the people in Mina, because if the latter come back and leave the ihram, the others will be just like them, and will be desacralized.

And if he is passing through, and it is not time to pray, let him stay there waiting for the moment of prayer. He will be able to make, thereafter, other prayers than those which are supererogatory, because it was reported to me that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) had made a prayer to Al-Mou'arass and it was the same for Abdallah Ibn Omar who had stopped there".

(940) 237 Aisha, the mother of the believers reported: "We left, the year of the farewell pilgrimage, with the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him grace and peace of Allah) and made the talbiat for a pious visit. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said to the faithful: “Whoever possesses his offering, let him make the talbiat for a pilgrimage with a pious visit, then that he does not leave the ihram until he has completed all the rites”. Safia added, “I arrived in Makkah having my period; thus I could neither make the processional rounds around the House, nor the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. I complained to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said to me: "Untie your hair, and comb it, then make the talbiat for the pilgrimage , leaving aside the pious visit”. She continued, “I accomplished everything. Then ending the pilgrimage, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) sent me with Abdel-Rahman Ibn Abi Bakr Al-Siddiq to Al-Tan'im, or I made the talbiat for a pious visit». The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) then said to me: “This is the place, where you will begin your pious visit”. Thus, those who had already made the talbiat for a pious visit, made the processional rounds around the House and the race, between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, then put themselves in a state of desacralization. Then they made a farewell tour, once they were back from Mina, for their pilgrimage. As for those who had made the talbiat for a pilgrimage or for a joint pilgrimage and pious visit, they made only one round”. (....) 238 - Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair reported from Aicha, the same hadith».
(941) 239 - Aisha reported: “I arrived in Makkah, and I had my period; so I did neither the processional rounds around the House, nor the route between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. So, I complained about this to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah), he said to me: “Do the rites just like a pilgrim, but without make the processional rounds around the House, nor the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, until you are in a state of purity”. About the woman who makes the talbiat for a pious visit, then who enters Mecca at the time of the pilgrimage, when she is having her period, Malek said: “She cannot make the processional rounds around the House; and if she fears not to be in purity, let her make the talbiat for a pilgrimage, and bring an offering. In this case, she is like one who has joined a pilgrimage and a pious visitation at the same time, and a single processional tour is sufficient for her. The woman who has her period, if she had already made the rounds around the House, and had prayed, she will be able to make the journey between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, also the station at Arafa and Muzdalifa, and will finally throw the pebbles. However, she will not be able to break out to do Tawaf el Ifada before she is purified of her menses. Chapter 75 The Tawaf el Ifada the surge of the woman who has her period.

(943) 241 - Aisha, the mother of the believers reported that she said to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): "O Messenger of Allah! Safia, Houaia's daughter, had her period. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) exclaimed: “it may be that she keeps us around the House”. He was answered, "Yes"; then he replied; "You are free to go."
(944) 242 - Amra Bint Abdel-Rahman, reported that when Aicha, the mother of the believers, made the pilgrimage with other women who were in danger of having their periods, she asked them to make the departure tour on the day of sacrifice.

Thus, he replied, "So, no." Malek said, “Hisham, 0urwa and Aisha had narrated the same hadith. And the men never pushed their wives to continue the rites of pilgrimage, especially since it will not be useful to them. And if the men, on the other hand, reacted differently, more than six thousand menstruating women would have come to Mina, all of whom had already completed their farewell rounds around the House”.
(946) 244 - Abu Salama Ibn Abdel-Rahman reported that Umm Sulaim Bint Milham asked for the opinion of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace), for having had her period, or for having given birth, and that after completing the rounds on the day of the sacrifice”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) authorized him to leave”. Malek said: “For the woman who has her period in Mina, she must stay there, until she makes the rounds around the House, which is an obligation for her. But if she had already made the rounds, before having her period, she can go home. This is also what the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had allowed, to the woman who has her period. Malek added, "If the woman has her period at Mina, even before she makes the farewell round, her distress at being unclean holds her back much more than menses ordinarily holds a woman back."

They demanded, in compensation, a goat from the deer killed. The man left saying: "There is the prince of the believers, who could not advance a sentence about a deer, only by summoning another judge to support him". Hearing this, Omar called the man and asked him, “Do you recite Surah “al-Ma’ida”? The man replied, "No." Omar continued: “Do you know this man who supported me in my judgment? "No; he replied. Omar continued: “If you had told me, that you were reciting sura “al-Ma'ida”, I would have beaten you atrociously; Allah Most High has said in his Book (meaning): "...Who will judge two of you, people of integrity, and it will be like an offering that is sent to the Ka'ba". Koran V, 95. This man who issued the judgment is Abul-Rahman Ibn Auf”.

About a man, who is a Meccans, being in ihram for a pilgrimage or a pious visit, having pigeons in his house, which died, because they were locked up, Malek said: “I think that 'he must expiate them, by advancing the offering of a sheep for each pigeon'.
(951) 249 - Malek said: "I keep hearing, that for every ostrich killed, by a man in ihram, he owes as compensation a camel or a cow". Malek added: "For the egg of an ostrich, I foresee the compensation of one tenth of the price of a camel or a cow in comparison with a free woman whose belly encloses, a son or a daughter, estimated each at fifty dinars, which is equivalent to a tenth of the price of his mother's blood. As for birds of prey such as the eagle, the osprey, the falcon, if they are killed by a man in ihram they must be expiated just like other game. This expiation of the small and the great is like the price of the blood of a child and a great, because they are on an equal footing”. Chapter LXXVII Of the atonement, of him who in a state of ihram kills locusts.
(952) 250 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that a man came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, saying to him: "O prince of the believers, I have killed, with my whip, while being in ihram, locusts" . He replied, "Go give the poor a handful of food."

(954) 252 - Ka'b Ibn Ujra reported that he was in the company of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah), in ihram.

(955) 253 - Ka'b Ibn Ujra reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "It is likely that these insects will cause you wrong". I replied, "Yes, O Messenger of Allah." He replies: “Go shave your head and then fast for three days, or feed six poor people or sacrifice a sheep”.
(956) 254 - Ata Ibn Abdallah Al-Khourassani reported: "I was at the market of "Al-Bouram" in Koufa, an old man told me that Ka'b Ibn Oujra told him the following: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) came to find me, whereas I revived the fire above a pot, for my companions. Lice crawled in my head and beard. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), r took me from my forehead and said to me: "Go shave this hair, and fast for three days, or feed six poor people". And the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) knew that I did not have a victim to immolate”. Malek said: “For the redemption of the crime, it consists in the fact that no one has to redeem himself before he has accomplished, which requires a redemption. As for reparation, it is a duty only when the subject is obliged to pay it; and he can make atonement wherever he wishes, in Mecca or elsewhere, opting either for sacrifice, fasting or almsgiving”. Malek added: “One who is in ihram, cannot pluck his hair, shave it or shorten it, before he leaves ihram. But if he suffers a disease in his head, (in his hair), he must, as Allah has commanded, redeem himself. He cannot cut his nails, nor kill the lice, nor remove them from his head and throw them on the ground, nor get rid of the lice from his skin, nor from his clothes. If the one who is in ihram gets rid of these insects, let him eat a handful of food”. Malek finally said, "He who epilates his nose or his armpits, or covers his body with depilatory products, or shaves his head out of necessity because of a wound, or shaves his neck for a bloodletting when he is in ihram, and that by forgetting or by ignorance, he must, by compensation, redeem himself. He must not shave his head to perform a bloodletting; therefore, whoever, by forgetfulness, shaves his head before throwing the pebbles, he owes redemption». Chapter LXXIX What one must do in case one forgets a rite.
(957) 255 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas said: “Whoever forgets or neglects one of the rites must sacrifice an animal”. Ayoub added: “I don't know, it says: 'neglected or forgotten'. Malek said, “If it's a sacrifice to be made, he should only do it in Makkah. On the other hand, if it is a compensation, he can do it where he wishes» Chapter LXXX Of several forms of redemption "fidya."
(958) 256 - For the one who, while being in ihram, wants to put on clothes, which are not allowed to him since he is in ihram, or even cuts his hair, or even wears perfume without any necessity, for good reason that it is easy for him to redeem himself, Malek said, "It is not proper for anyone to do this unless it is a necessity, and even then he must redeem himself." Malek was questioned for the question of redemption, fasting or alms or sacrifice, will its author have to choose? What will be the sacrifice? How much will the food be? What mod should I use? How many days will the fast be? Can we postpone this redemption, or will we have to pay at the same time? He replied, “Everything in the Book of Allah concerning redemption is found in such and such a form. And its author has the choice to do what he sees fit. As for the sacrifice, it is of a sheep; the fast is three days, the food is to be given for six poor, each having the share of two mudds, according to the mudd envisaged by the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and peace of Allah) ". Malek added, “I heard a few men versed in religion say, 'a man in ihram, aiming at something, kills game unintentionally, he has to redeem himself. It is the same for the one who left the ihram, if he aims in the enclosure something, and that he kills a game without wanting it, he must redeem himself, because what is premeditated and what is erroneous are in this case, on an equal footing...About a group of men, who, all in ihram or in the sacred enclosure, kill a game, Malek said: "I foresee, that each of them must redeem himself: if it is a sacrifice which is attributed to them, each must advance an offering; If a fast is imposed on them, each of them must fast. It is the same for men who by mistake kill an individual. In this case, the expiation of this homicidal act, will be the release of a slave, and that on behalf of each one of them, or that each one fasts for two months which follow”. Malek said: "Whoever kills game, or kills it, after throwing the stones and having shaved his head, when he has not yet made the farewell round, he has to expiate this crime of hunting, because Allah Blessed and Most High said: "Hunting when you have returned to the profane state". Koran V, 2. On the other hand, the one who has not yet made the tour (tawaf), what is forbidden to him are women and perfume”. Malek also said, “He who is in the state of ihram, will have nothing as redemption, for having cut down the trees of the sacred enclosure; and nothing has come to us about it, and it is wrong what he has done”. Malek finally said: "As for the one who, ignorant or forgetting to fast for three days during the pilgrimage, or by illness, he only fasts them, once he has returned home", he must do an offering, if he finds it, or that he fasts three days when he is at home, and another seven days thereafter”. Chapter LXXXI The rules followed during the pilgrimage.

Involuntarily, I shaved before sacrificing”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: “Immole, there is no harm in that”. Another said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! Involuntarily, I immolated before throwing the stones”. He replied: "Throw away (the pebbles) and don't worry about it". For any question put to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) concerning the anteriority of a rite performed, or its posteriority, his only answer was that: "Do such a thing, without any harm".

If he will not fast during this period, let it be done on the days of Mina”.

(975) 3 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "The ownership of horses is considered either a reward, or protection or burden. He who is rewarded is considered such, because his owner has dedicated him for the fight in the way of Allah, he tied him, lengthening the rope for him in a meadow or an orchard so that he grazes the grass . And all that is grazed will be counted as good deeds for that man who owns the horse. If it is done that this horse is detached from its cord, and that it goes away while crossing at the gallops two or three stages, its traces and its excrements are counted of them of good actions for this man owner. If it happens that this horse passes near a river, drinks without its owner wanting it, it will be counted as good deeds and will be rewarded. The horse which is a protection, is the one whose owner uses it for his subsistence, without begging from others, and without even forgetting the right of Allah on their necks and on their backs. As for the burdened horse, its owner tied it up out of vanity, ostentation and aversion to Muslims”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa sallam) was asked about the donkeys, he replied: "Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this verse general and isolated: "He who has done an atom's weight of good will see it. He who will have done the weight of an atom of evil, will see it” Coran XCIX. 7.8.

He is the one who, holding his horse's bridle, will go and fight in the way of Allah. Don't you want to know who will follow him? He is the one who, with his flock, lives in retreat, praying, paying zakat and worshiping Allah without associating anything with him”.
(977) 5 - Ubada Ibn Al-Samett reported that his grandfather said: "We took an oath of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him grace and peace of 'Allah) to hear him and obey him both in ease and in poverty, in what is pleasant and what is unpleasant, no longer to dispute power with those who hold it, and finally to say and to be for the truth where we are, without fear of reproach from a blamer”.
(978) 6 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that Abu Ubaida Ibn al-Jarrah wrote to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab about the troops of the Romans and what he fears about them”. Umar answered him, “Then whatever affliction may befall a believing worshipper. Allah will grant him deliverance as a result, because one embarrassment does not outweigh two eases. Allah Most High said in His Book: “O you who believe! Be patient! Encourage each other to be patient! Be firm! Fear Allah! Perhaps you will be happy» Coran III, 200. Chapter II The prohibition to carry the Koran in the country of the enemy.

The reporter added: “One of these men said: “The wife of Ibn Abi-Houqaiq, going to reveal our presence by her cries, I raised my sword to cut her down, when remembering the words of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) I refrained from doing it; otherwise, we would have gotten rid of her”.

(982) 10 - Yahia Ibn Said reported that Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq sent a troop to Syria. He went out to talk with Yazid Ibn Abi Sufian and the latter was at that time governor of one of his regions. It was claimed that Yazid had said to Abu Bakr: "Either you go up or I go down (We want to hear that Abu Bakr went on foot, as for Yazid, he was on horseback). Abu Bakr replied: "Neither for you to descend, nor for me to ascend, for I want to deserve the reward of my steps in the way of Allah". Then he said to him: “You will see people who have devoted themselves to Allah (The monks), leave them and the one to whom they have devoted themselves. You will see people who have shaved the top of their head (Deacons), strike them down by striking the top of their head”. And I recommend ten things to you: “Not to kill a woman, nor a child, nor an old man, not to cut down a fruit tree, nor destroy what is built; not to slaughter a sheep or a camel unless they are to eat; not to set the bees on fire and not to scatter them; not to cheat and not to be cowardly”. .
(983) 11 - It was reported to Malek that Umar Ibn Abdel-Aziz wrote to one of his prefects: "We were told that if the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him be grace and peace of Allah) sent a troop of men, he said to them: “Make the expedition in the name of Allah and fight in the way of Allah you will destroy those who do not believe in Allah; do not cheat, do not betray, do not disfigure your victims and do not kill children”. Transmit this to your army and your troops if it pleases Allah. May the peace be with you". Chapter IV Respecting the promise of security.
(984) 12 - Malek reported from a man from Kufa, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab wrote to the leader of a troop, sent on a mission: when the latter took refuge on the top of a mountain, a man among you said to him: "Come down and do not be afraid" and once he was close to it, the man killed him by traitor. Now, by Him who holds my soul in His hand! If I knew where the one who did this was, I would have to cut off his head”. Yahia said, "I heard Malek say, 'This hadith has not been recognized by the scholars, and one does not carry out (Umar's words namely) cutting off the head.' Malek was asked about the security pledge, is it verbal'? He answered: "Yes, I see that she may be making a sign of her hand, such that one advances to the troops and says: "Do not kill someone who has been promised safety. , because for me, a sign made with the hand is equivalent to a word”. I was told that Abdallah Ibn al-Abbas said: "The people who betray the promise, Allah will give victory to their enemy." Chapter V Of giving a thing in the way of Allah.
(985) 13 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar, giving another a thing, said to him: "Once you arrive at Wadil-Qoura, you will be able to enjoy it".
(986) 14 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: "When a man gives to another who fights in the way of Allah, one thing, and that man arrives instead of combat, he will be able to take advantage of it”. Malek was asked about a man who made up his mind to make an expedition, and who made up his mind; when he wanted to leave, his parents or one of them prevented him from doing so”. He replied, “Let him not irritate them, but postpone his expedition for the following year. As for his equipment (his weapons) he keeps it to use when he needs it. And if he risks that what he has disposed of is no longer usable, he can sell it in order to have the price, with which he will buy what to use for the next expedition. If he is well off, he can get the same equipment for his next expedition, where he can enjoy it as he sees fit. Chapter VI Of the assembly of booty during an expedition.
(987) 15 -Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) sent a troop where Abdallah Ibn Omar was a member, on the side of Najd. They procured a large herd of camels where each had a share of twelve or eleven camels. And for booty an extra camel.
(988) 16 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab say: "During an expedition, in case the men divided their spoils, they estimated the camel at ten sheep". About the slave present in an expedition Malek said: “If he witnesses the battle, and participates in it with the men, if he is free, he will have his share of the spoils; if he is not, and he does not participate in the fight, he is not entitled to anything. I even think that the booty is only on the part of the one who, a free man, participated in the fight. Chapter VII Of what is not subject to the quint."al qums" Malek said: "For the enemies who, landing in a territory belonging to Muslims, and claiming to have been thrown from the sea to the shores, while the Muslims only have insurance on this subject that the boats broken for evidence, or else being thirsty, they disembarked without the Muslims allowing them! It is for the governor to be a judge over them, and I do not think it is lawful for him who took them captive to have a share in the fifth (of the booty). Chapter VIII Of what Muslims are permitted to eat before the levy of the quint. Malek said, "I think there is no harm in Muslims having conquered enemy territory, eating their food before the spoils are submitted for sharing." Malek continues: “I think camels, cows and sheep are esteemed as food, which Muslims can eat, if they are in enemy territory. If the flesh of these animals must not be eaten before people attend the sharing of the spoils where everyone will have his share, this can upset the combatants. Thus, I find no harm in eating in order to subsist, and that it is without excess. But, what I disavow, is that someone makes a provision to bring it to his family”. Malek was asked about the fighter getting food from enemy territory. He eats it, stocks up, and he has some left over. Is he allowed to keep this leftover, either that he wants to bring it to eat with his family, or that he intends to sell it before returning home, to take advantage of the price? Malek replied, “If he sells this remnant and it is still on the expedition, I think that price must be added to the loot of the Muslims; but, if it is done that he is in his country, and that this remainder is on him, I see no harm in him eating it with his family, and that he benefits, even if this remainder is not of a certain value”. Chapter IX Of handing over to the owner what the enemies have procured.
(989) 17 - Yahia, reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Omar, had during an expedition, lost a maroon slave, and a horse which had fled, which fell into the hands of the enemy. The Muslims having recovered them, they returned them to Abdallah Ibn Omar, before they were counted as booty”. , Yahia continued: I heard Malek say about the property gained by the enemy, from the Muslims: “If their owners manage to take it back before the spoils are divided, this property is their right; but if the sharing of the loot has already taken place, they will no longer have the right to obtain them again. Malek was asked about a man whose slave was taken captive by the enemy and then recaptured by the Muslims. “Malek said, “His master has the primacy of having it without paying any price, value, or fine, unless it is counted as booty. Now, if it is, I think it should be handed over to its master for a price, if he wants it”. Malek was asked about a slave whose child is by a Muslim man; taken captive by the enemy and recovered by the Muslims, she is considered booty, after which her master recognized her by taking an oath. Malek said, “She is not to be taken as a slave, and I think the imam should pay her ransom on behalf of her master. If the imam will not act like this, it is up to his master to pay his ransom and not to neglect it. And if she belongs to someone other than her master by part of the spoils - I don't think it's his right to take her into slavery, nor to allow himself to live with her, because she has the same title as a free woman. Being said that his master must pay his ransom, if this woman is injured, the two cases are the same. Thus, he does not have to deliver the mother of his child, to slavery, nor to be cohabited”. Malek was asked about the man who leaves for the territory of the enemy in order to free the prisoners by paying a ransom, or for trade, buying himself the free and the slave or being offered them to him for donation. Malek replied, “Thus, for the free man, his price is a debt to be paid later, for he is not to be considered a slave. And if it is a gift received, it is free, and nothing is indebted to its title, except if the first man gave a reward in exchange in order to have it; in this case, it is a debt that the liberated man will have to pay, at the price of his freedom. As for the slave, his first master will have to choose: either that he take him back by paying the price to the one who bought him to free him, or that he deliver him to him, if he wishes. If this slave is a gift, he can take it back without any obligation on the part of his master; but if the man has already paid a ransom for his title to free him, in this case this ransom is a debt that the master will have to pay, if he wants to take him back”. Chapter X Spoils of the enemy as booty.
(990) 18 - Abu Katada Ibn Rib'i reported the following: “We went out with the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), in the year of Hunain. The Muslims entered into fierce combat with the enemy. I saw one of the enemies about to kill a Muslim. I turned to him and attacked him from behind, stabbing him in the carotid artery. He faced me and squeezed me in a way that I was going to smell dead then let go of me and fell dead. I ran into Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, he said to me: "What's wrong with the men?" I answered him: "It is the order of Allah". The men returned, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) said to them: "Whoever killed an enemy, by proving this, he will have his spoils". Then I stood up and said, "Who can be my witness"? Then I sit down. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) resumed his question: "Whoever killed an enemy, by proving this, he will have his spoils". Again I stood up to say, "Who can be my witness"? Then I sit down. Finally for the third time, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), r took up the same question; getting up, he said to me: “What is the matter with you, O Abu Katada”? I told him the scene, a man got up and said: “It is true, O Messenger of Allah, and the remains of the dead are with me. So let him be satisfied with his right to it”. Abu Bakr stood up and said to the man, “No! By Allah! The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) will not harm one of the lions of Allah who fought for Allah and his Messenger, may he give you his remains”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) then exclaimed: "Abu Bakr has spoken the truth" then addressing the man, he said to him "Give him these spoils". The man gave me the remains and by selling the cuirass, I bought myself with its price a garden at Bani Salama; and such was the first good that I benefited from Islam”.
(991) 19 Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that he heard a man questioning Abdullah Ibn Abbas about the spoils? Ibn Abbas replied, "The horse is booty, as well as the spoils." The man asked the same question again and received the same answer from Ibn Abbas. The man asked, for the third time, "What is the spoil mentioned by Allah in His Book"? Al-Kassem said: “And the man kept asking Ibn Abbas to the point of embarrassment, when the latter cried: “Do you know who this man is like? It is similar to “Sabigh” that Omar Ibn Al Khattab hit. Malek was asked about a man who killed an enemy, if he will be able to benefit from his remains without the imam's permission? He answered: “He cannot profit from it without the permission of the imam, and the latter can only decide according to his own knowledge. I have not been told that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa sallam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Let him who has killed an enemy take his spoils », except the day of Hunain». Chapter XI Exceptional shares of one-fifth of the booty. ."al qoums"
(992) 20 - Sa'id Ibn al-Musaiab said: "The men were given exceptional shares of one-fifth of the booty". Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." Malek was asked about the exceptional shares, could they be held from the first loot obtained? He replied, “It comes down to the Imam and his jurisprudence, and what is followed in Medina, cannot be done without the jurisprudence of the Sultan. On the other hand, I have not been told that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had acted in this way in all his expeditions except on the day of Hunain. Everything comes back to the imam's jurisprudence about the first loot obtained and the others after”. Chapter XII The shares of the riders during the expeditions.
(993) 21 - Malek reported: "I was informed that Omar Ibn Abdel Aziz said: "For the horseman, the right is two parts, and one part for the infantryman"? Malek added, "And we keep following that principle." Malek was asked about a man who has many horses in battle; will these horses all be shares to be shared”? He replied: I have nothing about it; and I think we should only give him the proper share of the horse he rode to fight”. Malek said: "The beasts of burden and the horses of a pure Arab race, are only horses, because Allah Blessed and Most High said: "He created for you the horses, the mules, and the donkeys , for you to mount them and for display” Koran XVI, 8. He also said: “Prepare to fight against them, all that you find, of forces and cavalries, in order to frighten the enemy from Allah and yours”. Koran VIII, 60. I think, said Malek, that these kinds of beasts, namely pack animals, are horses which the governor allows to be ridden”. Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: "We asked Malek, if we owe zakat for beasts of burden"? He replied, “Should we owe zakat for horses”? (Since the latter do not require zakat, so will the beasts of burden. Chapter XIII Fraud of booty.
(994) 22 - Amr Ibn Chou'aib reported: "When the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) returned from Hunain, heading towards Al-Jourana, the men asked him (to give them spoils) and ended up cornering him against a thorny shrub which shredded his coat and slipped from his back”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to them: "Give me back my name coat, do you fear that I will not share with you what Allah has given me granted as loot? By him who holds my soul in his hand! If Allah had granted me benefits as much as the trees of Tihama (lit. samura, kind of long tree) I would have shared them with you. You will not find me miserly, cowardly or a liar”. When the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa sallam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) descended, (from his mount), he stood among the men and said to them: "Give back the thread and the needle, for fraud is nothing but infamy, only fire and shame for its author on the day of resurrection". Then he picked up a camel's hair, or something similar, from the ground and continued: "By him who holds my soul in his hand, if Allah had given such a thing to you and to me, I would not delay not to distribute to you, even the fifth which belongs to me".
(995) 23 - Zaid Ibn Khaled Al-Jouhani narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) was informed of the death of a man on the day of Hunain. Zaid announced that the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “Make the funeral prayer for your companion”; the men's faces changed and Zaid continued that the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said to them, "Your companion has defrauded the booty."

(996) 24 - Abdallah Ibn al-Moughira Ibn Abi Burda Al-Kinani said that it was reported to him that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) came find people by invoking Allah for them, naming all the tribes and neglecting one. He says: “The men of this tribe found in the packsaddle of a mount which belonged to one of them, a necklace of black and white grains which he had defrauded of the booty. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) joined these men, made the takbir on them as one does for a dead person”.
(997) 25 - Abu Hurairah reported: "We left with the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) in the year of Khaibar, without us having had for booty, neither gold nor silver but only clothes and utensils. Rifa'a Ibn Zaid made a present to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r prayer (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) a black slave called Mid'am. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah), ordered the men to go to Wadi-Al-Qoura. When they were there while Mid'am was setting down the pack-saddle of the camel of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) he was hit by an arrow coming from chance, who killed him". The men exclaimed: "What a happy fate, let him be in Paradise". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: “No! By him who holds my soul in his hand! the "chemia" (large cloth in the form of a cloak) which he had taken from the spoil on the day of Khaibar before it was divided will burn it in the fire". Hearing of this, a man among the people brought one or two laces of sandals and gave them to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said: "One or two laces of fire”.
(998) 26 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas said: “Never did a fraud appear in people, but fear took their heart; when adultery spreads among people death increases when people falsify the measure and the balance, they will be deprived of goods; when people do not judge according to the truth, killing will spread among them; when people betray the pact, Allah will give power over them to their enemy”.

Abu Houraira when reporting this said: “I swear by Allah three times”.
(1000) 28 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Allah laughs at two men: Let one kill the other and they both enter Paradise. The first, fighting in the way of Allah, is killed; then Allah will return to the killer and make him repent; thus this killer will fight in the way of Allah, and will be killed in his turn”.
(1001) 29 Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: “By him who holds my soul in his hands! Whoever is injured fighting in the way of Allah, and Allah knows whoever is injured in his way, the day of the resurrection of his wound will come with blood; the color is that of blood, and the smell that of musk”.
(1002) 30 Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said, “O Allah! Do not let my murderer be a man who has already accomplished a single raka't, for You and who will be an argument to support him, on the day of resurrection”.
(1003) 31 - Abu Katada narrated that a man came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah ! If I am killed fighting in the way of Allah, resigning myself and hoping to be rewarded, always going forward and never retreating. Will Allah forgive me for my sins? He replied, "Yes." The man left, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) called him or ordered that he be called and said to him: "What is what you just said"; the man resumed his words; the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) then replied: "Yes, except for the debt, and it was Gabriel who came to tell me".

We fought like they did”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) answered him: “Certainly; but I don't know what will happen to you after I leave”; Abu Bakr began to cry, and continued then said: “Will we be alive after you”?
(1005) 33 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was seated, while a grave was being dug in Medina. A man at the sight of the tomb, exclaimed, "What a detestable abode for the believer!" The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: “It is wrong what you have just said”. The man continued: "I did not mean to point to the grave, but I meant to be killed in the way of Allah". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) replied: "There is nothing like being killed in the way of Allah, and no place is better for me than to have my grave in this place itself". He repeated this for three times and meant Medina. Chapter XV In which martyrdom consists.

Thus the coward flees his father and his mother, and the daring will fight without considering too much what he can bring back home. Killing is a means of death. The martyr is the one who gives himself for Allah, hoping to obtain the reward”. Chapter XVI On the Washing of the Martyr.
(1008) 36 Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab was washed, buried, and had the funeral prayer over him when he was a martyr. May Allah have mercy on him”.
(1009) 37 It was made known to Malek, that men versed in religion said: "The martyrs in the way of Allah, are not washed, one does not make the funeral prayer for them, and they are buried with the clothes they wore when they died. Malek said: "And this sunnah is to be applied to those who died in the field of battle, and who were not rescued to the point of death". And Malek added: "As for the one who manages to be saved and cured, and who continues to live as long as Allah wills, he will be washed, and he will be given the funeral prayer, just as it was done for Omar Ibn Al-Khattab”.

Chapter XVIII The exhortation to fight in the way of Allah.
(1011) 39 Anas Ibn Malek reported: “When the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was leaving for Quba, he was going to Um Haram Bint Milham, wife of Oubada Bint al-Samett, who fed him. One day, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) went to her house, she gave him to eat, then sat down to delouse his head. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) fell asleep, then woke up laughing. Um Haram said, "I asked him, 'O Messenger of Allah what makes you laugh?' He said to me: “Men from my community, were presented to me (in a dream), fighting in the way of Allah; they took to the open sea, kings on their thrones, or like kings on their thrones (the reporter suspects the accuracy)”.

How do you treat those who have followed Islam, are they entitled to their territories, or will they be for the Muslims, as well as their territories, or will they be for the Muslims, as well as their possessions”. Malek answered: “That is to be discussed: thus, those who signed a pact of peace, and having followed Islam, will have the right to their territories and the goods which they possessed; on the other hand those who were defeated by force, will not have the right to their territories, nor to the goods possessed even if they will follow Islam, because they fought against the Muslims, and confronted them; consequently their territories and their goods will be of Moslem belonging.

He replied: “If he has made a vow to carry it on his shoulders, wishing thereby to suffer and tire himself, he owes nothing, and let him walk on foot and make an offering. And if he had not made a vow of such a proposal, let him make the pilgrimage and go up, keeping this man company, for he had previously said to himself: "I will carry you to in the House of Allah.

(1032) 11 - Urwa reported that Aisha, the mother of the believers said: “An oath taken lightly is in saying: 'No, by Allah' and 'Yes, by Allah'.

Malek also said: “take an oath, in case the man swears not to sell a garment for ten dinars, then sell it at that very price; or that the man swears to strike his servant then that he does not strike him, and other similar cases. Such is the case with the oaths that man has to expiate, which is not for the oath taken lightly. Malek finally said, "For the man who swears on a thing, though he knows it to be vicious, or swears lying, conscious of his doing, either to please another, or to to excuse or to seize a sum of money, that is so serious that it cannot be expiated”.

But if he is silent and suspends his word, it is not counted to him”. Malek also said about the man who does not believe in Allah, or that he recognizes Him as an equal, then he goes back on his words, he does not have to make an atonement. He is considered neither an incredulous nor a polytheist only when his statements come from his inner self. So, let him ask forgiveness from Allah, and let him not do this again, because he has done wrong”. Chapter VII The oaths where one owes an expiation.
(1034) 13 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said 'Whoever takes an oath then he finds that he there was better to do, let him expiate his oath, and do what is best".

Malek continued, "For the affirmation of the oath where the man swears on one thing several times repeating his oath like the case where he says, 'I shall miss him no such and such, repeating this for two, or three or several times. The expiation in this case, he says, will be that of the oath. Let the man say: "By Allah, I would not eat this dish, I would not put on such a garment, I would not enter this house, swearing from all this, only once, there is only one atonement . But for a man to say to his wife "You are divorced, if you dress in this garment, or if I authorize you to go to the mosque, this constitutes a sequence of remarks in which he must return to one of two things: to have to send his wife away, without being accused of having committed after that, in what he did, a violation of the oath, because in all this there is only one violation of the oath". Malek finally said, “What is followed is that a woman can take a vow, without having the permission of her husband, and that for one thing, as long as it does not concern her body, otherwise she must s acquit it, and without thereby causing harm to her husband. If there is harm for him, her husband can prevent it, and she must fulfill this oath”. Chapter VIII The expiation of the oath.

(1056) 3 - Ata Ibn Yassar reported that a man of the Ansars, from Bani Haritha led a dairy camel to pasture, after dying, he took a sharp stick and cut her throat. We asked, in this regard, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said: "There is no harm, eat its meat".
(1057) 4 - Mu'az Ibn Sa'd or Sa'd Ibn Mu'az- reported that a slave girl in Ka'b, kept her sheep in a mountain called "Sal"; one of the sheep, going to perish, she took a stone with which she cut its throat”. On this subject, the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was requested who said: "There is no harm in that, eat of its flesh" .
(1058) 5 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas was asked about the animals slaughtered by Arab Christians”? He replied, "There is nothing wrong with that." Then he recited this verse: “Whoever among you takes them as friends is one of them” Koran V, 51.
(1059) 6 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Abbas said: "Any animal, whose carotids are already cut, eat of its flesh". (.....) 7 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab said: "About what one cuts the throat with, no harm, if it is a thing that cuts, in case of necessity”. Chapter III What is repugnant to eating the flesh of a slaughtered animal.
(1060) 8 - Abou Mourra the slave of Akil Ibn Abi Taleb, asked Abou Houraira about a sheep, which slaughtered, continues to move. He commanded him to eat of his flesh. Then to inquire further, he asked Zaid Ibn Thabet who said, “A slaughtered beast, will it be able to move? And he forbade him to eat of his flesh. Malek was asked about a sheep, which suffered several fractures. Its owner before it perished, cut its throat, and the blood flowed, without it moving. Malek said, "If he slit her throat, while she was still alive, and she was moving, let him eat her meat." Chapter IV The act of slaughtering what is kept in the belly of a beast
(1061) 9 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "When you cut the throat of a camel, you must even cut the throat of the little one she has in her belly, if it is completely created and its hair has grown . Once it is removed from its mother's womb, it must be slit in order to let the blood flow from its womb”.
(1062) 10 Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab said: "The immolation of what the female animal keeps, is done following the immolation of the mother, if it has been completely created and its hair has pushed". MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 25 The Book of the Hunt Chapter One The fact of forbidding to eat the meat of the animals killed by "Al-Mi'rad" and by the stone
(1063) 1 Nafe' reported: “I threw a stone, at two birds, while I was at “Al-Jourof”, and I hit them. One of them, being dead, Abdallah Ibn Omar, threw him. As for the other, Abdallah carried him and cut his throat with a hatchet; but being dead, before he was slain, Abdallah also threw him away».
(1064) 2 It was reported to Malek that al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad, rejected the act of killing the animal with the aid of a Mi'rad or a bullet”.
(1065) 3 It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab, was repelled that the domestic animal be killed like the animal which is to be hunted, by an arrow or any other means similar to it”. Malek said, “I don't see any harm in the animal, killed by Al-Mi'rad which burrowed into his body and caused his death, to be eaten. In the words of Allah Blessed and Most High: “O you who believe! Allah will test you about the game that your hands and your spears have procured for you” Koran V, 94. weapon, and it sinks into the body of the game and causes its death, is lawful hunting, as Allah has affirmed.
(1066) 4 - Malek reported: "I have heard learned men say, 'If the man succeeds in hunting game, supported by a water (1) or untrained dog, which is hunted cannot be eaten, unless the shooter's spear has penetrated the game while killing it, in such a way that no one can suspect that it was he who killed it; consequently the game is obviously dead”. (1) the game is found in a pond or lake and is dead without it being possible to determine whether it is by the blow of the hunter or by drowning after having only been bruised. Malek also said, “There is no harm in eating the game even after finding it later, but make sure that its death was caused either by a trained dog or by an arrow. . But if the killed game has been found a day later, it is forbidden to eat it”. (1) Al-Mi'rad: is a piece of iron, like an arrow, wide in the middle, and very sharp at the ends. It is indisputable, that if the animal is struck by the extremity of Al-Mi'rad it is to eat; but if it is struck in the middle, it is not, for it is illicit”. Chapter II Hunting with trained dogs or birds
(1067) 5 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said about the trained dog: "To eat whatever it brings you, whether it has been killed or not."
(1068) 6 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: Even if this dog ate game or not».
(1069) 7 - Malek reported that Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas was asked about the trained dog if he had killed the game”. Sa'd replied, "To eat game even if there is only one piece left."
(1070) 8 - Malek related that he heard men versed in the religion say concerning the hunting with the aid of birds such as: the hawk, the falcon and the eagle or their like, that if these birds seized game just like trained dogs, there is no harm in eating what they seize and kill, if one had already pronounced the name of Allah, before sending them to hunt”. Malek also said, "The best thing I've heard about game being stripped from a falconer's talons or a dog's paws, waiting for that game to be dead, that it's unlawful to eat it". Malek also said, "The same is true of game which is slain while being between the claws of the falcon, or held by the paws of a dog, but which the hunter leaves without slaying it, until whether that game is killed by the falcon or the dog, he cannot legally eat it”. And it's the same, adds Malek, in the case of the hunter who seizes his game while still alive, but does not hasten to slaughter it, to the point that he dies; again, it is not legal to eat it”. Malek finally said, "What is unquestionably followed is that when a Muslim sends a trained dog belonging to a Magus, behind game, which he seizes and kills, that game may be lawfully eaten, even if the Muslim did not kill him. His case is to be compared to a Muslim who uses the knife of a Magus with which he cuts the throat, or who uses the arrow or the bow of this Magus to hunt; thus its hunted game is legal to eat. In case the Magus sends the trained dog of a Muslim for hunting, what is seized is forbidden to eat, unless it is slaughtered. (By pronouncing the name of Allah). This case is similar to that where the Magus uses the arrow and the arc of a Moslem, with which he kills the game or of his knife with which the Magus cuts the throat of the game; none of this is legal to eat. Chapter III The subject of fishing at sea.
(1071) 9 - Nafe' reported that Abdel-Rahman Ibn Abi Houraira asked Abdallah Ibn Omar, concerning the animals that the sea throws on the shores, who says It is forbidden to eat them». Nafe' added: "Then Abdallah reconsidered his words, brought the Koran and recited: "The game of the sea and the food which is therein is permitted to you" Koran V, 96. Nafe' continues: "So, Abdallah Ibn Omar sent me to Abdel Rahman Ibn Abi Houraira, to tell him: “There is no harm in eating them”. (1072)'10 - Sa'd Al-Jari, the freedman of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “I asked Abdallah Ibn Omar about whales killing each other, or dying of cold? Can we eat them? He replied, "There is no harm in that." Then I asked about them, Abdallah Ibn amr Ibn al-A's, who gave me the same answer”.
(1073) 11 Abu Salama Ibn Abdel-Rahman reported that Abu Houraira and Zaid Ibn Thabet, saw no harm in eating what is thrown by the sea”.
(1074) 12 Abu Salama Ibn Abdul-Rahman reported that people from "Al-Jar" (place near Medina) came to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam in Medina, asking him about what the sea throws up, whether it is legal to eat it”. He answered them: “There is no harm in doing so”. Then he added: “Go to Zaid Ibn Thabet and Abu Houraira to find out more, then come back and tell me what they will tell you”. They went, asked them the same question and received the same answer again. They returned to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam, reporting to him what was said; then he answered them: "That is what I told you". Malek said: "There is no harm in eating the fish that a magus catches, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said about the sea: "Its water is purifying, and its dead animals are lawful". Malek added: "And if one eats these fish, even dead one must not take into account the fisherman". Chapter IV The ban on eating carnivorous animals
(1075) 13 - Abu Tha'iaba narrated that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "The eating of the flesh of a carnivorous animal is prohibited”.
(1076) 14 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "The meat of the carnivorous animal is forbidden to eat ". Malek said, "And that's what's being tracked." Chapter V What is forbidden to eat the flesh of animals
(1077) 15 - Malek said: "The best thing I have heard about horses, mules and donkeys is that their flesh is not to be eaten, for according to the words of Allah Blessed and Most High: "He created for you horses, mules and donkeys, for you to ride them and for display" Koran XVI, 8. He also said about herds: "...in order to let some of them serve you as mounts and others as food” Coran XL, 79. He also said: “So that men invoke the name of Allah on the beast of the herds” Coran XXII, 34. And : "eat it and feed the one who is content with it and the one who begs" Koran XXII, 36. Malek, interpreting these verses says: "I have heard that the unfortunate is the poor, and the one who begs is the man who blocks the way to ask for alms". Malek further says, "Allah has mentioned the horses, mules and donkeys for being ridden and for display, as for the 'herds,' they are for being ridden and for food." Malek finally said, "He who is content (with little food) is also poor." Chapter VI About the skins of dead animals (1078) 16 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas Reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) Upon him 1a grace and peace of Allah passed through a dead sheep which had been given as alms to a freedwoman of Maimouna, the wife of the Prophet r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace); he said: "Have you not taken advantage of the skin of this animal"? He was answered: “O Messenger of Allah, he is dead”, he continued: “The flesh of this animal is forbidden to you”.
(1079) 17 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "In case the skin is tanned, it is purified".
(1080) 18 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), orders that the animal skins are used once they are tanned”. Chapter VII He who is compelled to eat the flesh of a dead animal
(1081) 19 - Malek said: "That he has heard best, about the man who is compelled to eat the flesh of a dead animal, that he can eat up to to satiate oneself, by stocking up. But if he can dispense with it, let him push away this flesh” fruits or crops or sheep belonging to people, in the same place where this man is. Malek said, "If he thinks that the owners of these fruits, or these crops, or these sheep, will give alms to him as a necessity, so that he will not be considered a thief and the 'we cut off his hand, I think he can eat what he has found, in order to subsist, without having to stock up. And this is far more preferable to me than eating the flesh of a dead animal. And if the man might not be given alms, and be considered a thief for taking something, then. eating the flesh of a dead animal is preferred to me. And he can eat enough of this flesh, although I fear that he will become a transgressor if he does not take this flesh, preferring better to seize the goods of others in an illicit way, without an obligation”. Malek said, "That's the best I've heard." MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Merciful The Merciful Book 26 The Book of Al-'aqiqa Chapter One Of The Subject of Al-'aqiqa
(1082) 1 A man from Abi Damra reported from his father that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's mercy and peace) was asked about Al-"âqiqa". He replied: "I do not like the negligence of obligations". As if he were repelled by hearing this term. likes him to make a sacrifice for her, if he is able.
(1083) 2 Ja'far Ibn Muhammad reported from his father that Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) weighed, which were cut from the hair of Hassan, of Houssein, of Zainab and of Oum Koulthoum then she had paid an alms in money worth the weight of the cut hair”.
(1084) 3 Muhammad Ibn Ali Ibn Hussain, said: "Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had weighed the cut hair of Hassan and de Houssein, then paid the alms of the weight in silver”. Chapter II Works in Al-aqiqa
(1085) 4 Nafe' reported that if any member of his family asked, Al aqiqa;Abdallah Ibn Umar, would give it to him. He sacrificed a sheep in the name of his male and female children.
(1086) 5 Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Al-Hareth reported that he heard his father say that it was acceptable for him to make sacrifice, as aqiqa, even of a bird”. (1) Al-àqiqa: originally and according to Al-Asma, this term designated the hair on the head of the newborn; according to others, Al-àqiqa means the sheep that is sacrificed, once the infant's head is shaved.
(1087) 6 - It was reported to Malek, that a sacrifice was made in the names of Hassan and Housein, sons of Ali Ibn Abi Taleb.
(1088) 7 • Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father Ourwa Al-Zoubair sacrificed in the name of his children, male and female, a sheep for each”. Malek said about Al-'aqiqa: “Whoever wants to sacrifice on behalf of his children, let him sacrifice a sheep for each of them, whether male or female. Although this sacrifice is not obligatory however it is a good tradition which until then is always followed. So, whoever performs Al-'âqiqa in the name of his child, this is considered a rite and a sacrifice. And it's not allowed for the sheep to be one-eyed, or thin, or broken, or sick. None of his meat will be for sale, nor his skin, and his bones are to be broken. The family that made this sacrifice can eat of this flesh, can even give alms, but the child in whose name this sacrifice was made cannot touch its blood”. MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 27 The Book of Successions Chapter One Of The Succession of Reservants (1089) - Malek said, "What is traditionally practiced, and which I have seen men versed in religion apply for the question of the destination of the inheritance to a son, and which comes to him from a father or a mother is that: when one of them dies leaving male and female children, the boy will have the share of two girls; if the daughters are more than two, they will have two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there is only one, she will have half. In the event that other partners present themselves (according to the prescriptions of Allah), having the right to the inheritance and that among them is a boy, we begin by giving to those who have the right, then we will share what remains between them, each according to his share. The children of the son, whether male or female, will have the share of the own son, thereby depriving the other successors. If there are own sons and children of an own (deceased) son, and the own sons have sons, the latter will not have to share the inheritance with the children of the deceased. If the deceased does not have a son, but two or more daughters, the daughters of his dead son will not share in the inheritance with his daughters, unless he is with them, a boy who enjoys everything like them of the same parentage or further away, leaving a remainder of the inheritance which will be distributed among them in such a way that the share of the boy will be equal to that of two girls; but if nothing remains of it they will have no right to any share. If the deceased has only one daughter, she is entitled to half of the inheritance, as for the daughter of her son, be it one or more, she will receive (just like the others), each the sixth . But if there is a boy with them, they will have nothing left, not even a sixth. But if after the inheritance is divided, there remains somewhere, this must be given to the son's boy and daughters in such a way that the boy's share is equal to that of two daughters; on the other hand, he who enjoys a distant relationship has no right to anything. In the event that the division of the inheritance takes place, and there is nothing left of it, they will have no share, and this is in accordance with the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in his Book: "When to your children. Allah commands you to give the boy a share equal to that of two girls. If the daughters are more than two, two-thirds of the inheritance will go to them; if there is only one, half will belong to him”. Koran IV, 11. Chapter II Of the inheritance of the man coming to him from his wife and that of the woman coming to him from her husband (1090) - Malek said: “And of the inheritance of the man who comes from his dead wife, leaving neither a son, nor a child of one son or another, is one-half. But if the woman leaves a son or a child of a son, whether male or female, her husband will receive a quarter, and that after having made either a will or debts which have been discharged”. As for the inheritance of the wife which comes to her from her dead husband, leaving neither a son nor a child of a son, he is a quarter of it. But if he leaves a son, or a child of a son, whether boy or girl, his wife will have the eighth after her legacies and debts have been paid. This with reference to the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in his Book: “If your wives have no children, half of what they left you is yours. If they have a child, a quarter of what they left to you comes back to you, after their legacies or debts have been paid. If you have no children, a quarter of what you left will go to your wives. If you have a child, the eighth of what you left belongs to them, after your legacies or your debts have been discharged” Koran IV, 12. Chapter III The inheritance of the father and the mother coming to them from their child ( 1091) - Malek said, "What is unquestionably followed and which I have seen the versed men apply in Medina regarding the inheritance of the father due to him from his son or daughter is the following in the case of the death of the son or of the daughter, leaving a male child or a son of a male child, the share of the father is one-sixth of the inheritance according to what is prescribed by Allah; if the son or daughter is dead, leaving neither a son nor a child of a son and he is male, we begin by donating the shares to the heirs (in other words the reserveees), and if what rest is of the sixth or more, it is from the father. If what remains is not equivalent to the sixth, or if it exceeds it, the father is entitled to the sixth according to the prescribed forms”. For the inheritance of the rightful mother of her dead son or daughter: "If either has a child or a son of a male or female child with brothers, two or more, male be they or female siblings, or even of a father or a mother, the share of the mother is one-sixth”. If the deceased leaves neither a child, nor a son of a child, nor two brothers or more, the mother is entitled to one third, except if two other cases arise, namely: - In one of the cases, where the man dies, leaving his wife and father and mother; his wife is entitled to a quarter, his mother to a third of what remains and which is a quarter of the capital”. - In the other, where the woman dies, leaving her husband and father and mother; her husband is entitled to half, her mother to a third of what remains and which is the sixth of the capital”. This is in accordance with the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in his Book: “If the deceased left a son, one-sixth of the inheritance will go to each of his father and mother. If he has no children and his parents inherit him: The third will go to his mother. If he has brothers: The sixth will return to his mother” Coran IV, 11 . And the tradition followed is to consider that the brothers are two or more”. Chapter IV Inheritance going to womb brothers (1092) - Malek said, "What is followed in Medina is that the womb brothers shall not share in the inheritance if there be found a son, or children of a son, whether male or female; uterine brothers do not deserve any inheritance in the presence of a grandfather (father's father); but they inherit in any other case in such a way that each has the sixth of the inheritance, male be he or female, if they are two; if they are more than two, they will be partners, all receiving one-third of the inheritance divided between them, so that the share of the boy is equal to that of two girls. This is in accordance with what is said by Allah Blessed and Most High in his Book: "When a man or a woman, having neither parents nor children, leaves an inheritance, if he has a brother or a sister : the sixth will go to each of them. If there are several of them, they will share one third of the inheritance” Koran IV, 12. In this case, male and female are on the same footing of equality”. Chapter V The Inheritance of Full Brothers (1093) - Malek said, "What is followed in Medina is that full brothers shall have no part in the inheritance in the presence of a son, or a child of a son or father. But they inherit with the daughters, and the daughters of a son, the remainder of the inheritance, unless there be found alive a father of the father, and they are agnates. One begins by distributing the inheritance to those who are the reserveees, and if there remains any inheritance, it will be on the part of the full brothers and sisters, dividing it among them according to what is prescribed in the Book of Allah namely, that the boy shall have a share equal to that of two girls; and if nothing remains of the inheritance, they will have nothing”. Malek said: "If the deceased leaves neither a father, nor a grandfather (father's father), nor a son, nor a child of a son, whether male or female, his full sister will have the half of the inheritance; if his sisters are more than two and they are siblings, they will have two-thirds; if they have a brother, these sisters, being two or more, they will have nothing of the inheritance. One begins by giving the shares of the inheritance to the reservatories; if there is any left of this inheritance, it will be distributed among the full brothers and sisters, so that the share of the boy is equal to that of two girls. Except one case where they will receive nothing, being partners with the sons of the mother, in their share which is the third. For this case it is about the fact that a woman dies leaving a husband, a mother, uterine brothers and sisters, full brothers and sisters, her husband will have half, her mother a third, her uterine brothers and sisters third; for what remains, it will be the share of the full brothers and sisters who will be partners with the sons of the mother, of the third party, so that the boy will have an equal share with that of the girl. being all brothers and sisters of the deceased mother, moreover they inherited by their reference to the mother. Allah Blessed and Most High said in his Book: "When a man or a woman having neither parents nor children, leaves an inheritance: If he has a brother or a sister: The sixth will go to each of between them. If there are several: They will share one third of the inheritance”. Koran IV, 12. For this they are partners in this prescribed part, because they are all brothers and sisters from the mother's part”. Chapter VI The Inheritance of Consanguineous Brothers (1094) - Malek said, "What is followed in Medina, in case a man dies, leaving only consanguineous brothers and sisters, without his having any full-blooded children with them , blood relatives will have their share of the estate just as if they were siblings, namely males and females on the same basis; however blood relatives will have nothing of the heritage of uterine children if they exist, for blood relatives are similar to sibling children, but far from being related to uterine children who are begotten from the same mother. Malek said, “If at the meeting of the full brothers and sisters, and with them the consanguineous brothers, it is realized that for the former there is a male, the consanguineous brothers will have no part of the heritage. If the full heirs are female, or more than female, not having with them a male, the full sister receives half the inheritance, and the consanguineous sisters will have the sixth, completing two-thirds. If there is a male with consanguineous sisters (of the father), these will no longer have a share in the inheritance. We begin the inheritance, and what remains of the inheritance will be divided between consanguineous brothers and sisters (of the father) so that the male will have a share equal to that of two females; if there is nothing left of the legacies, they will have nothing. If the heirs are two or more full sisters, they will receive two-thirds of what is bequeathed, and consanguineous sisters will have no right to inheritance, unless with them there is a consanguineous brother, in which case they begin by giving their own heirs their shares, and what remains of the inheritance goes to the consanguineous (of the father) so that the male will have twice the share of a female. If nothing remains of the inheritance, they will have nothing. On the other hand, the uterine brothers and sisters, siblings, consanguineous, if each of them is one, he will have the sixth, if they are two and beyond, they will have the third, remembering that the share of the male will be equal to that of the female, being both on the same footing of equality”. Chapter VII The Legacy of the Grandfather
(1095) 1 - It was reported to Yahia Ibn Sa'id that Mu'awia Ibn Abi Sufian wrote to Zaid Ibn Thabet asking him about the inheritance of the grandfather. Zaid Ibn Thabet answered him: "You asked me in writing, about the inheritance of the grandfather, and it is Allah who is most informed, therefore, it is a matter of which only the caliphs can decide. I have witnessed two predecessor caliphs, who bequeathed half to him in the presence of a single brother, a third if they are two brothers, and always a third regardless of the number of these brothers”.
(1096) 2 - Ibn Chehab reported that Kabissa Ibn Zouaïb, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had given to the grandfather the share, which people give him today”.
(1097) 3 - It was reported to Malek: "That Sulaiman Ibn Yassar said that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, Osman Ibn Affan, and Zaid Ibn Thabet had given the grandfather a third share of the inheritance, if he there were brothers. Malek said: “What is followed in Medina, and which I have seen being applied by the versed men, is that the grandfather, namely the father of the father has nothing of the heritage of the father if he is still alive. He is entitled to the sixth, if he finds himself with a son, or a child of a son (also called his grandson). This is his, as long as the deceased has left neither a mother nor a paternal aunt, in which case we start by giving the heirs their shares and what remains of the inheritance, if it is a sixth or moreover, the grandfather will have the sixth”. Malek also said: "In case the grandfather is with full brothers and sisters of the deceased, the shares are first given to the reserveees, then for what remains, it will go to the grandfather, and to the brothers and siblings, taking into account that the grandfather will receive what will be advantageous to him, namely: either the third of what remains, to him and to the siblings, or else that he be considered as one of the full brothers, therefore, he will have the same share as each of them, or let him have the sixth of all the capital, thus, what is more advantageous is to give to the grandfather, his share being subtracted , the rest will be distributed in such a way that the share of the male is twice equal to that of the female, except in the case which will be the following: A woman who dies leaving her husband, her mother, a sibling, and a grandfather, her inheritance will be distributed as follows: The husband will have half, the mother, the third, the grandfather, the sixth, the full sister, half. Then we will add the sixth part of the grandfather with the half, part of the full sister, and we will distribute the addition to three thirds, so that the male will have the doubled share of the female, thus the grandfather will have his two-thirds, and the sister, one-third. Malek said: "The inheritance of blood brothers and sisters in the presence of the grandfather, and this if there are no full brothers and sisters with them, is similar to the inheritance of full brothers and sisters, so that the share of the male is double that of the female. If there are full brothers and sisters on the one hand, and blood relatives on the other, the siblings make the blood relatives heirs (who in reality are not heirs being eliminated by them) and share the succession with the grandfather. father, in view of their number. This will not be the case, if the brothers and being with the grandfather are uterine only, because these will have nothing in the presence of the grandfather who alone will be entitled to all the inheritance. Thus, after the reserve on the part of the grandfather, it is the full brothers and sisters who will share in what remains of the inheritance, dismissing the consanguineous brothers and sisters who will not be entitled to anything, unless the siblings are only one female. If she is only one, she will have her share with the grandfather, although the number of her consanguineous brothers and sisters will also have their share. Moreover, the share that the female will have is completely independent of that of her blood relatives, namely that she will have half of all the capital, and what remains will be divided between her blood brothers and sisters, so that the male's share will be double that of the female. And if nothing remains, they will have no share”. Chapter VIII Grandmother's Legacy
(1098) 4 - Kabissa Ibn Zouaib reported: "A maternal grandmother went to Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq to ask him about his share of the inheritance". Abu Bakr answered him: "You are not entitled to anything according to the Book of Allah, and I do not believe, that you are entitled to anything, according to the sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah). Come back, once I asked people about it”. Inquiring, Al-Moughira Ibn Chou'ba replied: "I was a witness, when the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) appropriated the sixth to him" . Abu Bakr asked him: “Was there another witness”? Mouhammad Ibn Maslama stood up and repeated the same words of Al-Moughira. So Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq reported what was said to the grandmother. Then the other grandmother, the paternal mother, came in turn to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, claiming her share of the inheritance. He replied, “Nothing belongs to you according to the Book of Allah, and what has been conceived as a part of it, concerns only one other than you. And from my part, I have no right to make additions to the norms of the distribution of inheritance. But, he is that sixth; if you and the other grandmother are both alive, it is yours, and if one of you is alive, she will have it alone”.
(1099) 5 - Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported: “The two grandmothers went to Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, who wanted to deliver the sixth to the maternal grandmother. But a man from the Ansars told him: "It's as if you were trying to neglect the part of the one who inherits the other grandmother in the event of his death, while he is still alive (he means hence the son of the son). Then, Abu Bakr appropriated to the two grandmothers, the sixth shared equally”.
(1100) 6 - Abd Rabbih Ibn Sa'id reported that Abu Bakr Ibn Abdel Rahman Ibn Al-Hareth Ibn Hisham only gave part to the two grandmothers”. Malek said: "What is followed and which is indisputable, and which men versed in religion apply is that the grandmother, (mother's mother) inherits nothing as long as the mother is still alive. . Apart from this case, the sixth is given to him, according to what is prescribed. As for the grandmother, (mother of the father), she inherits nothing in the presence of the mother or the father. With the exception of this case, she is entitled to the sixth, according to what is prescribed. If it happens that both grandmothers are living, while the deceased has neither father nor mother, Malek said, "I heard that if the mother's mother is closer to the deceased than the other grandmother, the first, is entitled to the sixth. If the mother of the father is closer, or if the two grandmothers are of the deceased, in the same situation, the sixth is shared equally between the two”. Malek also said: "Inheritance is not the right of any other woman among the relations in the degree of grandparents, except the mothers of the father, and of the mother, for I have been told that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was for the inheritance of the grandmothers. After him, Abu Bakr began to inquire until he received the affirmation of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) that he had inherited from the grandmothers. (In the penultimate hadith 1098-4, it was clarified) that the father's mother went to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, asking him for her share; he said to him, "I have no right to make additions to the prescribed rules, if you are both alive, the sixth belongs to you both, and in case only one is alive, she will have it to her only". Malek added: "We have not known anyone who has inherited, except the two grandmothers, from the beginning of Islam, until our days". Chapter IX On the inheritance of collaterals
(1101) 7 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab asked the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) about the inheritance of relatives he replied: “It is enough for you, on this subject, to refer to the verse which was revealed in summer, and which is found at the end of the sura “Women”. Malek said: “What is followed and which is indisputable, and which the men versed in Medina apply, is to consider the collaterals, to two aspects: thus, what is from the verse mentioned at the beginning of the surah “The women: verse No 12» «When a man or a woman, having neither parents nor children leaves an inheritance: If he has a brother or a sister: the sixth will go to each of them. If there are several: They will be divided, the third of the inheritance”. This first form of inheritance does not entitle the uterine sisters and brothers to any share, so that there is neither son nor father. For the other form of inheritance, it is to be found in the verse mentioned at the end of surah The Women, verse No 176, where Allah Blessed and Most High said: "They ask you for a decision concerning the inheritances . Say: “Allah gives you instructions regarding distant kinship: If someone dies without leaving any children but only a sister, half of his estate will go to this one. A man inherits from his sister if she has no children. If he has two sisters, two-thirds of the estate will go to them. If he leaves brothers and sisters, a share equal to that of two women goes to a man. Allah gives you a clear explanation so that you do not go astray. Allah knows everything”. Koran II, 176. Malek said: "This last form of inheritance, where the brothers and sisters are successors-agnates, if there is not a child to the deceased, they will share the inheritance with the grandfather, to whom belongs the right to inherit in the presence of the brothers and sisters, because he has the primacy of it more than they; even he inherits with the male children of the deceased, the share of the sixth, as for the brothers, (of the deceased), they inherit nothing, in the presence of his male children (of the deceased). How will he not be like one of them, when he has the share of the sixth in the presence of the children of the deceased? How will he not have the third with the full brothers and sisters, and the uterine brothers and sisters had the third? Thus it is the grandfather who renders absent the part of the heritage of the uterine brothers and sisters, and his presence deprives them forever. And it is he who deserves the part which, in fact, was their right. If the grandfather had not had the third, the uterine brothers and sisters, should have had it, so the grandfather took what should go to the consanguineous brothers and sisters, and where the uterine brothers and sisters had more third party rights than the former. Now the grandfather has the primacy of having a third of the uterine successors”. Chapter X About the paternal aunt
(1102) 8 - Abdel Rahman Ibn Hanzala Al-Zourqi reported that a freedman of the Quraishites, known as Ibn Mursi told him: "I was sitting with Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, once he made midday prayer, he called his servant: “O Yarfa! Bring me this letter, a letter that I had already written about the aunt, so that we can discuss its content and have a consultation”. Yarfa, brought it to him with a basin, or a glass containing water. Suspecting the contents of the letter, Omar erased the writings of the letter, then he said: "If Allah had wanted you to be heiress, he would have assigned it (in His Book: The Koran)", he repeated this twice .
(1103) 9 - Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Hazm reported that he frequently heard his father say: “Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “I am amazed at the status of the paternal aunt: she bequeaths her inheritance, but n 'has no right to any share to inherit'. Chapter XI The inheritance of those who constitute “Al âssaba” (1) “Al âssaba” is the plural of the term “asseb” designating, any male heir entitled to the inheritance, be it partial once the reserveees have received their shares if they exist, or total if the latter do not exist. About "Al-assaba", Malek said: "The standard followed in Medina, and which is far from disputed, and which I have seen the versed men apply is the following: - The first brother has the primacy to inherit only the consanguineous brother. - The consanguineous brother has more right to inherit than the sons of the first brother. - the sons of the full brother have to inherit before those of the consanguineous brother. - the sons of the consanguineous brother take precedence in the inheritance of the grandsons of the sibling. - the grandsons of the consanguineous brother precede in succession the paternal first uncle. - The consanguineous paternal uncle inherits before the first cousins. - The consanguineous paternal cousin takes precedence in the inheritance of the uncle, the first paternal of the father. Malek added: “Any question that was put to me about the inheritance says: “Al-'âssaba”, will be explained as follows: “If there are several agnates at the deceased, and that one of If they are close to the deceased on the father's side, as for the others, the inheritance goes to him given his descent and not his ancestry. If this agnate is the son of a blood relative, but closer to the deceased than the sons of a sibling, it is more to him that the inheritance belongs than to them. If they are all equal in descent from a single father, and whether they are the sons of blood or siblings, let the inheritance be divided equally between them. If the father of some agnates is the first brother of the father of the deceased, and if other agnates are found, whose father is the consanguineous brother of the father of the deceased, the inheritance must go to the former, for Allah Blessed and Most Haut said: “However those who are related by kinship are closer to each other according to the Book of Allah. Verily, Allah is the all-knower" Koran VIII, 75. Malek said: "And the grandfather, the father's father, has much more right to inheritance than the sons of the first brother, even more than the uncle first father. The son of the first brother has more right to the patronage of freedmen more than the grandfather”. Chapter XII Those to whom the inheritance does not belong Malek said: "What is followed, and indisputable, and which I have seen even the versed men applying in Medina is that the inheritance does not belong to the son in any way. of a uterine brother, nor to the grandfather father of the mother, nor to the paternal uncle who is a uterine brother, nor to the maternal uncle, nor to the grandmother mother of the father of the woman, nor to the daughter of the first brother, neither to the paternal aunt nor to the maternal aunt”. Malek added: “So any woman as mentioned in the Quran, whose relationship to the dead is so far, will inherit nothing. It is the same for all the other women, put aside, those who are mentioned in the Koran. Allah has, moreover, mentioned in his Book the following inheritances: - The inheritance of the mother returning to her from her son. - That of their father's daughters. - That of her husband's wife. - That of the full sisters. - That of consanguineous sisters. - That of the uterine sisters. - And the grandmother will receive, according to what was decided by the Prophet r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah). - Finally, the woman inherits the slave she had freed because Allah Blessed and Most High said: "About the slaves": "They are your brothers in religion, they are yours" Koran XXXIII ,5. Chapter XIII The Legacy of Those Who Follow Another Religion
(1104) 10 Osama Ibn Zaid reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "The Muslim does not inherit the impious."
(1105) 11 Ibn Chehab reported that Ali Ibn Abi Taleb told him that Akil and Taleb inherited Abu Taleb, while Ali inherited nothing even of the mansion (reverting to Bani Hashem) Located at "Al-Chi 'b'. Note: Note that Ali and his brother Ja'far converted to Islam, as for Taleb and Akil, they were on their polytheism; which explains why the latter were the only ones to inherit their father.
(1106) 12 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that Muhammad Ibn Al-Ach'ath related that his paternal aunt, who it seems was either Jewish or Christian, died; Muhammad Ibn Al-Ach'ath came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, asking him: "Who will be his heir"?. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab answered him: "His heirs are his co-religionists". Mouhammad Ibn Al-Ach'ath, always came to inquire about this subject with Osman Ibn Affan; and the latter replied: “Do you think I have forgotten what Omar told you? his heirs are his co-religionists”.
(1107) 13 Ismail Ibn Abi Hakim reported that a Christian slave, freed by Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz, died. Ismail continued: “Omar Ibn Abdel Aziz ordered me to deposit his property (namely his inheritance) in the public treasury”.
(1108) 14 Malek reported that a man known by his trust, told him that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab say: "Omar Ibn Al-Khattab refused that the inheritance should go to a stranger , jump to the one who was born in an Arab territory (Muslim so to speak)”. Malek said: "If a pregnant woman comes from the country of the enemy, to settle in a Muslim country, the child who will be born there, will inherit it after her death, and she will inherit it at her turn if he dies. This is what is mentioned in the Book of Allah”. Malek added: “What is followed in Medina, and according to the sunna which is not to be disputed, which the versed men, apply, .is that the Muslim does not inherit an impious, nor for parental good , neither by patronage, nor to be of the same lap, and this Muslim will not be able to eliminate one of the heirs of the impious”. Malek finally says: "It is the same for the one who does not have the right to inheritance, he cannot make the other heirs absent in case they are". Chapter XIV The legacy of those whose outcome is unknown whether they were killed or disappeared, or otherwise...
(1109) 15 - Malek reported from Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdel Rahman, from the words of more than one of their learned men, that inheritance does not go to those who were killed in the days of “Al-Jamal”, “Siffine”, “Al-Harra”, and “Koudaid”. None of them inherited his companion, except the one who was known to have been killed before his companion. - Malek said: "What, moreover, is a rule unquestionably followed in Medina, and which has never been the subject of debate by men versed in religion, hence what is a respected tradition, is never to share the inheritance with those who died during a drowning, or in a slaughter, or in other circumstances of the death, if one did not make sure of the death from one of them. Their legacy goes to their living successors.” - Malek added: “It is unseemly for one person to inherit another, when he suspects it; a person inherits from another only on the basis of either knowledge or truthful testimonies, as such let us consider a man who died with a slave whom his father had freed, the sons of the Arab man (namely the one who freed the slave) say: "We have a right to the inheritance of the freed man, because it is our father who freed him and he has a right to his inheritance". However, this is not their right to inherit, without knowledge of the facts or the presence of witnesses, who justify that this freedman died before the father. If this is the case, those closest to this freedman inherit it”. Malek said, “Likewise, consider two full brothers who died, and where one of them had a son, the other had none. And that these full brothers had an inbred brother. Ignoring which of the two had died before the other, the inheritance of the one who did not have a son will revert to his consanguineous brother, without him giving any of the inheritance to the son of his full brother”. Malek finally said, "Let's consider again, the case where the paternal aunt dies at the same time as her brother's son, or a brother's daughter with her paternal uncle, without it being known who died before the other. If this will be ignored, the paternal uncle inherits nothing from his brother's daughter, and the brother's son will receive nothing from his paternal aunt”. Chapter XV The inheritance of an adulterine or anathemized child (i.e.: considered to be natural)
(1110) 16 It was reported to Malek that Urwa Ibn al-Zoubair said about the anathematized or adulterine child: "If he dies, his mother inherits him according to the Book of Allah to Him the power and the glory; his uterine brothers are entitled to their share of the inheritance according to the law, and for what remains, it will revert to the heirs who are relatives of the mother, if the latter is a slave. If the mother is an Arab (i.e. free from condition) she will have her share of the estate, as well as her uterine brothers, as for the rest, it will go to the public treasury (right of all Muslims) Malek said: "It is the same thing that was reported by Suleiman Ibn Yassar”. And Malek added, "And that is what was practiced by the versed men in Medina." MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 28 The Book of Marriage Chapter One About Engagement
(1111) 1 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Let none of you ask for the hand of a woman that her brother (of the same religion) has already asked for her".

Malek, explaining the words of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) mentioned before and it is Allah who is most informed about it said: "Once that a man grants his engagement with a woman, that this one inclines towards him by agreeing to fix a well determined dowry, and that they are well understood, that she will have what is hers suitable; it is the case of such a woman to whom a man is forbidden to ask her in marriage, and he did not want to hear the case of the woman, who being in disagreement with her suitor, without her accepting him willingly, not to be asked to marry again. Otherwise, people are in a state of perversity”.
(1113) 3 Abdel-Rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported that, his father, interpreting this verse: "There will be no fault to reproach you for, if you allude to a marriage proposal, or if you do not speak to person of your intention. Allah knows that you are thinking of these women however, do not promise them anything in secret: Just say to them the words that befit them” Koran II, 235. It said: “Let a man say to a woman, while she is in the waiting period following the death of her husband "You are so dear to me, I desire your person, and may Allah bring you good and blessings" or other words of the same meaning. Chapter II Asking the consent of the virgin girl, and of the widow to marry them
(1114) 4 - Abdallah Ibn Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "A widow has in person much more than his protector (to decide on a marriage); as for the virgin girl, it is to her protector (father or other) that one asks the agreement of a marriage license; its acquiescence to it, is its silence”.
(1115) 5 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "A woman can only be asked for marriage after having had the permission of her protector, or the opinion of her sages parents, or that of the Sultan/ or prince”.

Malek said, "That is what is followed, for the marriage of our virgin daughters." And he added: "And the virgin has no right to enjoy her wealth, until she is in the marital house, and shows insight of mind."
(1117) 7 - It was reported to Malek, that, Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad, Salem Ibn Abdallah, and Suleiman Ibn Yassar said about the virgin girl: "Her father can present her in marriage, without having her license, and she a, to obey him”. Chapter III Matters of Dower and Donation
(1118) 8 - Sahl Ibn Sa'd Al Sa'idi reported that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and said to him “O Messenger of Allah! I give you my person”. Remaining unanswered for a long time, a man stood up and said: "O Messenger of Allah give her to me in marriage, if you do not need her". The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) him asked: "Do you have anything to give her as a dowry?" - The other replied: "I only have my izar" - The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) resumed: "in case you give it to him, you will remain without izar; find something". "I did not find anything" said the man. salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) continued: "Search, even if it is only an iron ring. The man searched but found nothing. The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: "Do you remember some suras of the Koran"? - The man replied: "Yes, I have remembered such and such a sura Then the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: “I give you this woman e in marriage, for what you have retained from the Koran".
(1119) 9 - Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "Any man who marries a woman suffering from madness or leprosy, and has had intercourse with her, he must pay her her dowry in full, and he must claim an indemnity from her protector”. Malek said while interpreting the previous subject: “The protector of the woman, be he her father, her brother or whoever, having given her in marriage, knowing her illness, he must pay her indemnity to her husband. But if her protector, giving her in marriage, is either a cousin, or another protector or someone close to her, namely, that they were not aware of her illness, they will have nothing to pay as indemnity. As for the wife, she will return what she had taken as a dowry, and a certain sum will be left to her as compensation for what her husband had enjoyed of her. (.....) 10 Nafe' reported that a daughter of Oubaidallah Ibn Omar whose mother was the daughter of Zaid ibn Al-Khattab, was the wife of a son of Abdallah Ibn Omar who died, without he never had relations with her, and without determining a dowry for her. As the mother of this woman demanded her daughter's dowry, Abdallah Ibn Omar replied that he refused it, moreover "if she had the right to a dowry, we would not have touched it, and we would not would not be detrimental to him, said Abdallah. The mother insisting on this right, Zaid Ibn Thabet was summoned to judge on this subject; he says, that she has no right to a dowry, but on the other hand has a right to an inheritance”.
(1120) 11 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Abdel-Aziz, during his caliphate, expressly ordered his prefects, that any man, father or otherwise, giving a girl to marry, must formulate the amount of a dowry, which is the woman's right, if she so desires". Malek said: "A girl given by her father, for a marriage, in such a way that he formulates a donation to them with the dowry, this donation is considered at the end of a marriage contract, the girl can claim it if she wants it, even if her husband had left her, and even before he is actually her husband, her husband will be entitled to half of this donation forming part of the contract”. - Malek also said: "A man who will marry his son, still young, and that the latter does not have property, it is up to the father, in this case to take care of the dowry, if his son, the day of his marriage does not own any property. But, if the son has property, it is he who must formulate a dowry, unless his father had undertaken to take charge of the dowry himself. And this marriage is legal to the son, even if he is so young, and that he is under the guardianship of the father”. - For the man, dismissing his virgin wife, without having had relations with her, and that the father of this woman, renounces half of the dowry, Malek said: "It is allowed to the husband, the from the father of the woman," he added, "For Blessed Allah Most High has said in His book (meaning): 'Unless they renounce it' meaning by that, the women with whom the husbands have had carnal intercourse, or: "Or that he who holds the marriage contract withdraws" and it is the father who had given in marriage his virgin daughter, or the master of the slave. And Malek who continues: “This is what is followed in Medina”. - About the Jewish or Christian woman marrying a Jew or a Christian, but having embraced Islam, before her marriage, Malek said: “She is not entitled to any dowry”. - Malek finally said: "I do not consider that the dowry of a woman given in marriage, be less than a quarter of a dinar, being the minimum value of a stolen object which by sanction, costs only the hand of the thief be cut off". Chapter IV The Lowering of the Curtain
(1121) 12 Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khat-tab allowed regarding the man marrying a woman, that if the curtains were lowered (understood alone), the dowry is obligatory".
(1122) 13 Ibn Chehab reported that Zaid Ibn Thabet said: "If the man is with his wife, and the curtains are drawn down, the dowry is a right", (i.e. that the woman and the man be: husband and wife). (.....) 14 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: “If the man goes to a woman, to her house, we believe him and we deny it. If she enters his house, he is believed, and the dowry will be a right”. - Malek interpreting these words, he replied: "I foresee there, carnal relations: If the man had gone to the woman and she claimed to be touched, while he will deny this fact, the dowry is not not due. But if it was she who went to his house, and he claimed not to have touched her, what she says will be, the dowry is due”. Chapter V The stays of the husband with his virgin (s) or already married (s) wives
(1123) 15 - Hisham al-Makhzoumi reported from his father that: "When the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had married d 'with Oum Salama, and that she had been at his house, he said to her: "I am not going to cause you any humiliation. If you want, I will stay for seven days with you, and on the other hand I must stay for another seven days with the others, or, if you want, I will stay for three days and I will do the same for the others”. She replied, "I am for the three days."
(1124) 16 - Anas Ibn Malek said: "The man who marries a virgin, will stay with her for seven days, and if it is a woman who is already married, it is for three days". - Malek said, "That's what's tracking." Thus, for the man who marries a woman, while he has one, after he has devoted a few days to the one he has just married, the other days will be equitably distributed among his wives”. Chapter VI What are not permitted as conditions in a marriage contract
(1125) 17 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn al-Musaiab was questioned about the woman who gives her husband the order not to take her out of his country anymore”? He replied, "He can get her out, if he wants to." - Malek said: "What is traditionally followed, when a man formulates to the woman the order, in the marriage contract, not to marry another, nor to have captives, that is not too much to consider unless there is an oath of divorce or deliverance, whether he will do one or the other, in which case it is his pledge”. Chapter VII Marriage of one who makes a marriage lawful and the like.
(1126) 18 Al Zoubair Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn al-Zubair reported that Rifa'a Ibn Simwai had divorced his wife, Tamima Bint Wahb, in the time of Allah's Apostle r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) three times. This woman married Abdel-Rahman Ibn Al-Zoubair who could not live with her or touch her, so he repudiated her. Like Rifa'a, her first husband wanted to have her again in marriage, and that he had divorced her, he told the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him be grace and the peace of Allah) who forbids it by saying to him: "You cannot marry her, before she has tasted the little honey (namely, to have carnal relations with her second husband)".
(1127) 19 Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that Aisha, wife of the Prophet r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) was asked about a man who had divorced his wife permanently. woman, this one being remarried with another who repudiated her, without having carnal relations with her. Is it permissible for her first husband to have her again”? Aicha replied, “No, not until he tasted his little honey (i.e. the second husband).
(1128) 20 - It was reported to Malek that Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad was asked about a man who permanently divorced his wife, then another had married her, but who died before having carnal intercourse with she. Will his first be allowed to have it again”? Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad replied, "Her first husband has no right to have her." Malek said, "about what is 'lawful,' that a man who marries a woman, whom he had previously divorced, he cannot maintain that marriage until he has married at new. If he has consummated this marriage, he will have to pay her her dowry”. Chapter VIII The women who cannot be married together
(1129) 21 - Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "A man cannot marry a woman, whereas he had married his paternal or maternal aunt”.
(1130) 22 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab said: "A man is forbidden to marry a woman while he is the husband of his paternal or maternal aunt, and to 'to marry a pregnant captive of a man other than himself'. Chapter IX The forbidden marriage of a man with his wife's mother
(1131) 23 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Zaid Ibn thabet was asked about a man who married a woman and then left her before he had intercourse with her carnal, will he be able to marry his mother? Zaid Ibn Thabet replied: "No, because the mother is an equivocal subject, as such, no clear explanation has been found, as opposed to the case of the beautiful girls placed under her guardianship".
(1132) 24 - Malek reported, according to several statements, that Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud was questioned about his opinion while he was in Kufa, about the marriage of the mother. after the daughter, if it was not touched. He allowed it. Then going to Medina, Ibn Mass'oud went to inquire about this subject of marriage, on which he was told an answer quite different from his own; however that the authorization was for the case of beautiful girls placed under guardianship. Thus Ibn Mass'oud turning back to Kufa, and even before returning home, he went to the man who had asked his opinion on the subject of marriage (of the mother following the daughter), to whom he ordered him to leave his wife. - Malek said about the man who, marrying a woman, then will marry his mother, his wife will be forbidden to him, and will have to leave them both, having forbidden them together, if he had had relations with the mother. But, if he had not touched the mother, his wife will not be forbidden to him, but he will leave the mother”. - Malek also said about the man who marries a woman, then marries her mother while having carnal intercourse with her, the mother will not be lawful for him, nor for his father, nor for his son, the even daughter of this woman will be forbidden to him and consequently his own wife will be such to him”. - Malek finally said: “However, if it is a concubinage nothing will be forbidden from it, because Allah Blessed and Most High said: “The mothers of your wives (who are forbidden to you)” Quran IV, 23.. Thus, what is illicit is marriage, without it being mentioned, that it is concubinage which is illicit (which is of this verse). Therefore any marriage intended to be granted with a woman who is not prohibited, will be considered licit”. And Malek adds: "That's what I heard being followed, in Medina." Chapter X The marriage of a man with the mother of the woman whom he had already touched, in an illicit way (1133) - Concerning the man who fornicates with a woman, on whom the prescribed penalty has been applied , Malek said, “This man can marry this woman's daughter, and again, he can give this woman's daughter in marriage to his son if he wants, as long as his intercourse with the woman was illicit. Therefore Allah has forbidden any transgression of lawful or even dubious marriage and He said (meaning): “Do not marry the women whom your fathers had for wives” Koran IV, 22. Malek said "If a man marries a woman, while she is in her waiting period, and this marriage is lawful, so that he had intercourse with her, this woman will be forbidden to the son of this man, to marry him by the very fact that her father had lawfully married her, without being subject to the prescribed penalty. And the child that this marriage will generate, will belong to the father.

Chapter XI Illicit Marriages
(1134) 25 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbade the marriage known by “Al-Chighar”.

Then Umar said, "Any woman who has married while in her waiting period, and her husband has not yet had intercourse with her, they will be separated between them, until she has completed the period of her first marriage, after which the other will be considered as a suitor who is willing to become engaged to her. However, if he had had relations with her, they are separated, then she will have to complete her waiting period for the first marriage and another for the second marriage, and she will not marry this man again”. - Malek reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said about it: "And this woman will be entitled to the dowry for the satisfaction that the man allowed himself from her". - Malek added: “What is followed, about a free woman whose husband is dead, is to live in widowhood for four months and ten days. She will not have to marry if she suspects her period, waiting for the case to be regular by removing all doubt, if she fears being pregnant”. Chapter XII The Marriage of a Slave While Being the Husband of a Free Woman
(1138) 29 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Abbas and Abdallah Ibn Umar were questioned about a man married to a free woman, who wanted to marry a slave? They refused that he had both in marriage
(1139) 30 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al- Moussaiab said: "One does not marry a slave while one is married to a free woman, unless the latter approves it, in this case, she will be entitled to two-thirds of the life shared by two”.

But, in case she had been, he could not marry her, unless she was married to someone else”. - About the man who marries a slave girl (who was not of his affiliation) and who gives her a child, then he buys it, Malek said: "She is not considered the mother of his child, having given it to him, while belonging to another. But if she will give him a child, she, captive of war but already of his belonging to him, after he has bought her, she will be legally the mother of his child”. - Malek added: “If the man buys a captive of war pregnant with him, and she gives birth to a child, she will be considered the legal mother of this child.

And “You are still forbidden two sisters together…” Koran IV, 23. Malek continued: “The man came out of Osman's house, and met one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) to whom he asked on the same subject. He answered him: “If this business belongs to me in person, and that I found someone doing that, I should have made him an example (not to be imitated by others, and to chastise him). Ibn Chehab added: "I think this companion was Ali Ibn Abi-Taleb".
(1145) 36 - It was reported to Malek that al-Zoubair Ibn Al-Aawam was of the same opinion as Ali Ibn Abi Taleb. Malek said, "For the female slave who belongs to a man who married her, and he intends to do the same with his sister, the latter is forbidden to him as a wife until his sister has been given in marriage to another, or that she has been completely freed from it, or that her freedom is executed for the benefit of a sum provided for and that by marrying her off to a slave who belongs to her, or belongs to another .

Chapter XVI Prohibition against marrying the slaves of the people of Livre (1148) - Malek said: "It is not lawful to marry a Jewish or Christian slave, for Allah Blessed and Most High has said in His Book: “Union with believing women of good condition, and with women of good condition belonging to the people to whom The Book was given before you” Koran V,5. They are indeed, free Jewish and Christian women. Also, Allah Blessed and Most High said: "Whoever among you does not have the means to marry believing women and of good condition, will take believing captives of war" Koran IV, 25. They are the believing captives ". Malek added: “So therefore, I think that Allah allowed the marriage of believing slaves, and prohibited the slaves of the People of the Book namely, the Jews and the Christians”. These, Malek continues, are permitted to their masters, being war captives, but it is not permitted to marry a Magus-slave even if she is a war-slave. Chapter XVII Concerning women of good condition
(1149) 41 - Ibn Chehab reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: "The women said to be of good conditions are those who have given themselves for a legal marriage, and this amounts to the fact that Allah has forbidden fornication" .
(1150) 42 - It was reported to Malek that Ibn Chehab and Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad said: "If the free man marries a slave and has had relations with her, she engages him in marriage". Malek said, “And everyone I knew said the same, that the slave binds the free man into marriage. If he marries her, having carnal intercourse, she engages him in marriage”. Malek added: “A slave who marries a free woman by having intercourse with her, he engages her in marriage. But a free woman who marries a slave does not commit him in marriage, unless he is freed, and once he is, she can have him as a husband. But if he separates from her before he is freed, he is not engaged for marriage, waiting for him to be freed and marry a woman (whether free or slave ). - Malek also said: "If a woman slave finds herself the wife of a free man, who separates from her, before he frees her, his marriage to her, cannot make her a woman of good condition, as long as she is not freed and her husband cohabits with her after his release, and this is the case which engages this slave in marriage. Yet, a slave married to a free man, and freed while being his wife, even before he separates from her, he makes her a woman of good condition if he separates from her, he makes her a woman of good condition if he releases her as long as she is his wife, and he had intercourse with her after he released her”. - Malek finally said: "The Christian or Jewish free woman, and the Muslim slave woman, commit the free man to marriage, if he marries one of them, and with whom, he has had reports". Chapter XVIII The Marriage of Enjoyment
(1151) 43 - Ali Ibn Abi Taleb, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) forbade the marriage of the enjoyment, the day of Khaibar, and the eating of the flesh of domestic donkeys”.

Chapter XIX Marriage of Slaves
(1153) 45 - Yahia reported from Malek, that he heard Rabi'a Ibn, Abi Abdel-Rahman say: "A slave can marry from four wives (just like a free man)." Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." - Malek also said: "The slave is different from the one who allows himself the marriage, if his master allows him to marry (for four times), these marriages are legal, otherwise, the one who allows himself the marriage can separate the slave of his wives, by annulling these marriages so that they are legally concluded". For the slave whose wife owns (either by gift or by inheritance) or for the man who owns his wife, Malek said, "As long as one is the possession of the other, there will be separation and no longer a divorce, but if each of them reverts to the other for the purpose of a legal marriage, the separation between them is in no way considered a divorce”. - Malek finally said: “The woman who owns a slave, and is at the same time her husband, if she frees him while she is in his waiting period, the two separated, one of them cannot return to the other only according to a new marriage”.

The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) exclaimed: “Come down, Abu Wahb (nickname of Safwan), the latter replied: “No by Allah, I I won't come down until you clear up this matter".

(1186) 21 - It was reported to Malek that Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam judged the case of the man who made the solemn promise to abstain from his wife as follows: "If the four months of the waiting period have passed, it is already repudiated, and it is up to him to have it again, as long as it is in the period of waiting”. - Malek said: "And Ibn Chehab shared the same opinion". - Malek about the man who makes a solemn promise to forbid himself from his wife and is judged, then divorces her after the four months (waiting period) have passed, and he does her again come back said, "If this man has not had carnal intercourse with his wife until her waiting period has elapsed, it will never be possible for him to have her, nor to be again with her, unless he presents an excuse of illness or imprisonment or a similar excuse. In this case the fact of having it again is definitive. On the other hand, if the woman's waiting period elapsed, after which he married her, and he had no intercourse with her until the period of waiting has passed, the man is to be judged. If he has not taken her again, he is already divorced from her, for his solemn promise to forbid himself from his wife has already been made, since the four months have passed, without he has the right to bring her back. Because, in this case, he married her, then divorced himself without having had carnal relations with her, consequently, the waiting period is no longer considered, and he does not don't have to make her come back again". Malek said of man who makes solemn promise to stay away from his wife, then stands trial after four months, divorces her and then brings her back without having had sex carnal with her, and that the four months have elapsed before the waiting period has already ended (in the case of a pregnancy, for example), that this man is not subject to judgment, and is not required to divorce. On the other hand, if he had sex with her before the waiting period was over, he has the right to have her again. But if the waiting period has already ended before her husband has had intercourse with her, he cannot, in this case, take her back”. "And that's the best I've heard about it." - Malek also said: "Concerning the man who makes a solemn promise to forbid his wife, then divorces her, and the four months (so-called waiting period) have passed before this period has even already ended, it is a divorce done for twice, if the man is called to be judged and he has not had relations with his wife. If the waiting period ends before the four months have elapsed, this man's engagement is not taken for a divorce, because the four months after which the wife was to be forbidden to her husband, have passed. , without her being his wife yet”. Malek added: "Whoever makes a solemn promise to abstain from his wife for a day or a month, and then remains there until the four months have passed, this is not taken as a commitment, because he will be considered such, for the one who has made a promise, for more than four months. On the other hand, the one who makes a solemn promise to abstain from his wife for four months, or less than that, I do not see that he is subject to a commitment, because as soon as this period has already passed, his commitment is no longer considered, and therefore it will not be subject to judgment”. - Malek finally said: “Whoever makes a solemn promise to his wife, to forbid himself from her, until the weaning of her child, this case is not considered a commitment. And I was informed that Ali Ibn Abi Taleb, asked about this, he did not consider it a commitment”. Chapter VII Of the commitment of the slave (.....) 22 - Malek asked Ibn Chehab about the commitment of the slave" He answered him: "It is almost similar to the commitment of the "free man, and will even be an obligation to him. However, it is only valid for two months. " Chapter VIII About the free man who compares his wife to the back of his own mother
(1187) 23 - Sa'id Ibn Amr Ban Solaim Al-Zouraqi asked Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad about a man who divorced his wife, if he marries her”. Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad replied: "He is like the one who compares a woman to the back of his own mother and marries her". However, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab gives him the order, that if he ever marries her, that he does not touch her, before making expiation.
(1188) 24 - It was reported to Malek that a man asked al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad and Solaiman Ibn Yassar about a man who, before marrying his wife, compares her to my mother's back”. They replied, "If he has married her, he will not have to touch her until he makes atonement."

Allah, Blessed and Most High, according to His words, said - about the atonement of the oath of the man who compares his wife to his mother's back: "The freeing of a slave before he touches his wife”, “If he does not find, a fast for two months in a row before he touches his wife, and if he is unable it falls to him to feed sixty poor people”. - Concerning the man, who, in different circumstances compares his wife: "On my mother's back", Malek said: "He has only one expiation to make". Now, if he says this then expiates then repeats it after his first expiation, he must again make expiation”. - Malek added: “Whoever compares his wife to his own mother's back, then touches her before making atonement, he will have only one atonement to make. Then he forbids his wife until he makes atonement and asks Allah's forgiveness. And that's the best I've heard about it. - Malek also said: - For women who are told: "Be for me like my mother's back" and that they are forbidden to man, or others who are foster sisters, or relatives, they are all considered under the same conditions”. - This way of divorce is only allowed to men”. - For the words of Allah Blessed and Most High (meaning) "Those who divorce their wives with the formula: "Be for me like my mother's back", and who go back on what they said" Quran LVIII, v.3. Malek said: “I have heard in the interpretation of this verse, that it is the act of the man who formulates this repudiation and then decides to keep his wife and have intercourse with her. If so, he owes an atonement, but if he divorces her without having had relations with her, and without deciding to keep her, he will not have to atone. . If he marries after that, he will not touch her with her until he makes the atonement of one who compares his wife: “to the back of his own mother”. - Malek said: "The man who formulates such a repudiation of his wife (slave), if he wants to have intercourse with her, he will have to make an atonement, before he has touched her". - Malek finally said: "This way of divorce is considered as an oath of repudiation, only if the man wants to cause harm without going back on his oath".
(1190) 27 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that he heard a man ask Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair about a man who said to his wife: “Any woman I marry after you, will be for me like my mother's back". Ourwa answered him: "It is enough for him for the expiation, to free a slave". Chapter IX About the slave who compares his wife to his mother's back
(1191) 28 - Malek reported that he asked Ibn Chehab about the repudiation of slaves according to the formula: "Be for me like my mother's back". He said to him, "They are subject to the same conditions as a free man." * Malek said: * “The slave is considered under the same conditions as a free man”. * "This kind of repudiation is an obligation for the slave, and must on the other hand expiate it by fasting for two months in a row". * "When the slave compares his wife to the back of his own mother", this is not considered an oath of repudiation, because if he was going to fast which is that of the expiation of two months, just like a free man, he would have to divorce him before he finished his fast”. Chapter X About Options
(1192) 29 - Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that Aisha, the mother of the believers, said: “About Barira there were three judgments one of which demanded his release. Giving him the choice, she opted to keep her husband. Then, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “The patronage is the right of the one who freed”. Then the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) Upon him the grace and peace of Allah entered while a pot full of meat was boiling. He was served bread and food that was at (Aicha's) house. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Did I not see a pot where there was meat"? He was answered: "Yes, certainly, O Messenger of Allah, but this meat is an alms given to Barira, and you, you do not eat what is an alms". Then, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: “She is a charity for Barira, and for us a gift”.
(1193) 30 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said about the slave married with a slave and she is freed, the slave will have her choice to keep her husband, or to divorce him, until the latter has touched her” (after being freed). Malek said: "If her husband touched her, and she claims not to know that she had a choice, then she is charged, and what she did is not believed. alleged ignorance. And it is no longer up to her to divorce her husband after he touched her.
(1194) 31 - Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair reported that a slave belonging to Bani Adii, known by Zabra' told him that she was herself a slave. Freed, she continues, Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet (upon him the grace and peace of Allah) summoned me and said: "I am going to tell you something, and I do not like you to make a decision of your fate. The decision is yours, unless your husband touched you. Because, if that's the case, you won't have anything left to decide”. I answered him: "I am for the divorce, the divorce and the divorce". So-, she divorced him, for three times».

(1197) 34 - Malek reported that he heard Ibn Chehab say: "If the man gives his wife the right to choose, (between staying with him or being separated) and she will choose to stay with her husband, this case is not taken as a case of divorce". - Malek said, "That's the best I've heard." - About the one who is given the choice, Malek said: “If her husband gives her the right to choose, and she will choose her own person, that is a divorce done for three times. And if her husband says to her: “I only gave you, for once, the right to choose, what he said, is not to be considered”. And that's the best advice." - Malek finally said, "If her husband gives her a choice, and she's like, 'So I accepted once,' and her husband refuses, saying, 'Rather, I'm giving you a choice for three times", and she refuses except for one, she stays with him as a bride, and therefore, it is no longer a separation "Allah willing".

When her husband Thabet Ibn Qais came, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to her: "Here is Habiba Bint Sahl, who has just told me, this that Allah wanted it to be", Habiba said: "O Messenger of Allah, all that he has given me, I have it at home". Addressing Thabet Ibn Oais, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) said to him: "Take back everything you gave him", Thabet took it back and Habiba remained with her parents (separated from her husband)" .

If she is married, then separated from her husband, without his touching her, she will not have to undergo a second waiting period, and she will take the first period into account”. Malek added, "That's the best I've heard about it." - Malek finally said: "If the woman asks her husband for a divorce by giving him part of his property, on condition that he repudiates her, and that her husband divorces her for three successive times, the divorce is at consider. But if the divorce was made intermittently, it is not to be considered”.

Will he kill this man and face the executive sentence? Or else, tell me, what should he do? Assem ask for me this question to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam)”? Reporting this matter to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) he was repelled and disgusted so that Assem felt pain from what he had heard of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), Assem returned to his home, Ouwaimer came to his home and said to him: “O Assem, what was the response of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah)”? Assem replied: "Your question did not bring me any good, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) hated the question that I put to him posed". Ouwaimer replied, "By Allah, I will not be silent until I ask him the question, personally." Ouwaimer went in search of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) until he found him in the midst of a crowd so he said "O Messenger of Allah, what say you about a man who finds his wife with another man? Will he kill him and then he will have to be executed himself, what should he do”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) answered him: "A verse has been revealed to me about you and your wife, so go and bring the »! Sahl continued: “The two spouses presented themselves before the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and took an oath of anathema, while I was present with people. Once they finished their anathemas of reciprocity, Ouwaimer said: "O Messenger of Allah I would have lied, if I had restrained him", so he divorced her three times, before the Messenger of Allah ( salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) commands him". Ibn Chehab added: "And such was the sunnah of anathemas."
(1202) 40 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar narrated that a man had, in the time of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah), accused his wife of anathema, by refusing to recognize the child as her own. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) separated them by attributing the child to the wife”. - Malek said: “Allah Blessed and Most High said (meaning): “As for those who accuse their wives without having witnesses other than themselves: the testimony of each of them will consist of testifying four times before Allah that they are truthful and a fifth time to call the curse of Allah that they have uttered a lie; we will divert the punishment of the woman, if she testifies four times before Allah that her accuser is lying and a fifth time to call on herself the wrath of Allah, if it is he who is truthful” Koran XXIV 6-8. - Malek said: “The sunna followed in Medina is that those who are accused of anathema, they are forbidden to have intercourse with each other. If he contradicts himself, he will be flogged and the child will be attributed to him. He won't be able to have his wife again. And it is the tradition, followed in Medina, which is neither to be doubted nor disputed». - Malek also said: - "If the man separates definitively from his wife, in such a way that he can no longer bring her back, then he refuses her pregnancy, he can accuse her of anathema if she is pregnant and if she claims that it comes from her cohabitation with him, unless it is attested that it comes back to a period of which one doubts, and that the man is ignorant of it”. Such is the tradition followed, and which I have heard from versed men. - "If the man accuses his wife of infidelity after he has divorced her three times, while she is pregnant, as for him, he admits that this pregnancy comes from him then claims that he has seen fornicate before he separates from her, he will be scourged, and will not have to accuse her of anathema. But if he disavows his wife's pregnancy after he has been divorced from her for three times, he must accuse her of anathema”. "And that's what I heard." - “And the slave is on an equal footing with the free man, as regards defamation and accusation of anathema. He acts just like a free man with regard to the accusation of anathema, which is not the case with defamation, namely that he is not subject to flogging (in case the 'accused female slave, is in fact innocent)'. - "And the woman, whether she is a Muslim slave, or a free woman, Jewish or Christian, she will be able to accuse a free Muslim man of anathema, if he marries one of them having carnal relationships. For Allah Blessed and Most High has said in His Book: "As for those who accuse their wives", as long as these women are wives". “And such is the tradition followed”. - "If the slave marries a free Muslim woman or a Muslim slave, or a free Jewish or Christian woman, he must take the oath of anathema". - "About the man who makes an oath of anathema to his wife then reconsiders his oath by contradicting himself after one or two oaths, without appealing to the curse of Allah on him for the fifth time, Malek said, "If he goes back on his oath before he curses, he must be flogged, and there is no separation between him and his wife." - "About the man who divorces his wife, and who, after three months have passed, she admits to being pregnant, Malek said: "If her husband denies this pregnancy, he must take an oath of anathema". - "Regarding the captive of war to whom her husband pronounces an oath of anathema, then buys her", Malek said: "He must not have relations with her, even if she is in his possession, because the Sunna demands that two spouses who have sworn oaths of anathema to each other can never be with each other again”. - “Finally Malek said: “If the man accuses his wife of anathema before having intercourse with her, she will only have half the dowry”. Chapter XIV The right of inheritance of the child falling to two subjects separated by anathema
(1203) 41 - It was reported to Malek that Ourwa Ibn Al Zoubair said about the adulterine child or accused of being of anathematized parents, if he dies, his mother inherits him according to the rights prescribed in The Book of Allah Almighty, and it is the same for his uterine brothers who will have their right of inheritance, as for the rest of the inheritance it will return to the relatives of the mother if she is a freedwoman, but if she is an Arab woman , she will have with the uterine brothers of her child their right of inheritance, and for what remains, it returns to the Moslems”. Malek said: "And I was told that Suleiman Ibn Yassar was of the same opinion, and this is what I again saw followed by the versed men in Medina". Chapter XV The Divorce of the Virgin
(1204) 42 - Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Thawban reported that Muhammad Ibn lyas Ibn Al-Bukair said: "A man divorced his wife for three times before having carnal intercourse with her and then he had wanted to marry her again, so he came to ask about it, versed men and I kept him company. He asked Abdallah Ibn Abbas and Abu Huraira about this, who replied, "We are considering not allowing you to marry her, until she is married to another and then divorced." He continued: "But I only divorced her once." Ibn Abbas said: "You delivered from your hand the best you possessed".
(1205) 43 - Ata' Ibn Yassar reported: "A man came to ask Abdallah Ibn Amr Ibn Al'As about a man who divorced his wife for three times, before he had her touched". Ata' said: "It is only for once that a divorce is made from a virgin". Abdallah Ibn Amr Ibn Al'As protested and said to Ata: “You are only a reporter of hadiths. A one-time divorce imposes a new marriage and a new dowry. But the divorce made for three times, the woman will be forbidden to the husband until she is married to another man than her husband (then divorced).
(1206) 44 - Boukair Ibn Abdallah Ibn Al-Ashaj reported that Mu'awia Ibn Abi Ayach Al-Ansari was seated in the company of Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair and Assem Ibn Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, when Muhammad Ibn lyas Ibn Al- Boukair came to them and said, "A Bedouin man divorced his wife three times before he had intercourse with her, so what do you think about her"? Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair said: "We cannot decide this matter, so go to Abdallah Ibn Abbas and Abu Houraira, whom I have just left at Aicha's, and ask them the question then come back to bring us the answer". He left and asked them the question. Ibn Abbas said to Abu Huraira: "O Abu Huraira, answer him, here is a difficult question that has been put to you". Abu Hurairah replied, "A divorce done once, imposes a new marriage and a new dowry, and one that is done three times, will make the woman forbidden to her husband, until she is married from another man than him (and divorced)". Malek said, “Such was the tradition followed in Medina. As for the woman who had already been married to a man without his having had relations with her, she will be treated like a virgin: divorced once, she must marry again and have a new dowry. , divorced three times, she will be prohibited for her husband until she is married to another man than him (and then divorced).

Now, she only had her period once Abdul Rahman fell ill, when she got cleansed, she let him know, so he divorced her permanently or even divorced her once which was the third, because he was sick. Osman Ibn Affan gave him his share of the inheritance when his waiting period was already over”.
(1210) 48 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Muhammad Ibn Yahia Ibn Habban said: "My grandfather Habban had two wives: a Hashemite and an Ansarian, he divorced the Ansarian while she was still nursing his small. A year ended, and this woman did not have her period, and then the man died. She said: “I have the right to inheritance, as long as I haven't had my period”, the two women argued and then went to report the matter to Osman Ibn Affan. Having given the right of inheritance to the Ansarian, the Hashemite blamed Osman who said: "Such was the decision taken by your cousin, who imposed it on us", designating by the cousin, Ali Ibn Abi-Taleb" . (Of the same descent as the Hashemite).
(1211) 49" Malek reported that he heard Ibn Chehab say: "If a man being sick divorces his wife three times, she will be entitled to inheritance". - Malek said: "And if he divorces from her, being ill and that before he has intercourse with her, she will be entitled to half of the dowry, to her share of the inheritance and she will have to consider her waiting period. if he has had relations with her, then he divorces her, in which case she will be entitled to the full dowry and her share of the inheritance."

His postage does not change the length of his waiting period, whether she returns or does not return to him, this period is invariable”. *Malek said: *The same is true of the penalty that the slave is subjected to, then that he be set free after he has been subjected to the penalty. For his pain remains that of a slave. - * And the free man definitely divorces the slave woman by three pronouncements of divorce, and his waiting period is two menses. As for the slave, he definitively divorces the free woman by two pronouncements of divorce, and his waiting period is three periods”. * For the man who marries a female slave, then buys her and frees her His waiting period is two periods, if he has not touched her. But if he has carnal intercourse with her, after he buys her and before he sets her free, she will have only one period for a waiting period, after which she can marry".

(1238) 78 - Ibn Chehab reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: "The waiting period for a woman experiencing a discharge of blood (which is not menstruation) is one year". - Malek said: “It is the tradition followed for the divorced woman whose menses cease when her husband has divorced her, to wait for the passage of nine months. If during this period she does not get her period, her waiting period will be for three months. If, before these three months are over, she has her period, she will have to wait for it again. If nine months have passed before she gets her period, she will have a three-month waiting period. If she has her period for the second time before the three months are up, she will wait for the next ones. In case the nine months have already been completed before she gets her period, she will have a three month waiting period. If she has her period for the third time, it means that she will have completely completed the three periods. If she doesn't get her period, she should wait three months until she gets married. And in this case, her husband will be able to take her back, before she gets married, unless he had definitively divorced her”. - Malek said, "The tradition followed among us, when a man divorces his wife while having the right to take her back, and she has partially passed her waiting period, then he takes her back, and hence he will separate from her before he touches her - that is, the woman will not have to consider what has already passed from the waiting period, and she will begin a new waiting period of the day of her divorce, because her husband, having brought her back without his needing her, will have committed an unlawful act. * What is followed among us, when the divorced woman becomes a follower of Islam while her husband remains impious and then converts to Islam, that he has full right to keep her as long as she is in his waiting period. But if the waiting period has already passed, he will not be able to bring it back. And if he marries her after the waiting period has elapsed, the divorce will no longer be considered as such, because the conversion to Islam separated them without him having divorced her” . Chapter XXVI The subject of the two arbiters

Allah will restore harmony between them of them, if they want to be reconciled. Allah is the one who knows and who is well informed” Koran IV, 35. This is explained either by the separation or the reunion of the two spouses. - Malek finally said, "And this is the best I have heard from versed men, that the two arbiters have the right to judge between the man and his wife, separating between them or bringing them together" .

(.....) 81 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud said: "For the one who says: "Any woman I marry is divorced, if he has not designated either the name of the tribe, nor that of the woman, her oath is not to be considered". - Malek said, "That's the best I've heard." - Malek finally said: “Regarding the man who says to his wife: “You are divorced, as well as those with whom I will marry”, and who still says: “All my goods will be alms if I do not such and such a thing", then that he goes back on his oath, his case will be the following: "As for his wives, they are certainly divorced, as for the other women whose name, tribe or country have not been specified , his oath to them is invalid. And for his goods, he will have to give alms from the third party”. Chapter XXVIII The delay granted to the man who has not touched his wife

Would it be from the day of the wedding, or from the day when the woman brought the accusation of her subject to the governor”? He replied, "Rather, from the day she brought the accusation against the governor." - Malek said: "But for the one who touched his wife and then for some reason forbade himself, I did not learn that he was granted the setting of a deadline, or a separation between both". Chapter XXIX The Different Cases of Divorce

(1244) 85 - Ibn Chehab reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab, Humaid Ibn Abdul Rahman Ibn Awf, Ubaidallah Ibn Abdallah Ibn Utba Ibn Mass'ud, and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar, reporting what Abu Houraira said, “I heard Umar Ibn Al-Khattab say, “Any woman whose husband has divorced her for once or twice, then he lets pass the period of idda making his wife divorced After which the wife marries another, who dies or divorces her, so that her first husband marries her again, in which case he is left with only a mention of divorce for his divorce from her to be final and that it is subsequently forbidden to him". - Malek said: “It is good, the sunna followed, which is not to be disputed”.

Leaving his house, I met Abdallah Ibn Omar on the way to Mecca. I told him what happened to me, he got angry and said to me: "It's not a divorce, and it's not forbidden to you, go back to your family". Being still concerned, I went to Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair, who at that time was in Mecca, the governor, telling him what is my business, and what was the response of Abdallah Ibn Umar, Abdallah Ibn Al-Zoubair answered me: "Your wife is not forbidden to you, and therefore returns to your family". Then he wrote to Jaber Ibn Al-Aswad Al-Zouhari, who was the governor in Medina, ordering him to punish Abdallah Ibn Abdul Rahman and to leave my wife and me alone.

I would not keep you in my house and you are not lawful to another”, about him. Allah revealed this verse: “Repudiation can be pronounced twice.

I was repeating the story to him where I had alluded to my husband's affair, so he said, "Stay at home until, what is prescribed has expired." Then she said, "I stayed at home for four months and ten days" and when Osman Ibn Affan sent for me, to ask me about it, I told him.

We took as captives the best women of the Arabs. As we desired the women, and that on the one hand we felt the pain of our state of celibacy, on the other, we desired ransoms in exchange for the captives, we decided to cohabit them by ejaculating outside the uterus. So, we said to ourselves: “Can we do this, without asking the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) since he is among us”.

Then she rubbed this perfume on one of her servants and passed her hand over her cheeks saying: "By Allah, I do not need to wear perfume, however I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam ) (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) say: "It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Day of Resurrection to be in mourning for more than three days, except in the case of her husband, where her mourning should be four months and ten days".

(1270) 114 - (During the third hadith) Zainab said: "I heard Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) say: 'A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, my daughter has just lost her husband, and her eyes are sore can she coat them with Kohol”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: "No", repeating the "no" for two or three times, meaning by this "A definitive no then he said: “The mourning is for four months and ten days. And during the pre-Islamic period, one of the women threw a dung after the passage of one year”. Houmaid Ibn Nafe' continued: "I asked Zainab: 'Why the woman was throwing dung after the passage of a year'? She replied, "When the wife lost her husband, she lived in a place with poor furniture, and put on ragged clothes, without touching any perfume or anything like that, until a year was up. . Then she asked for an animal, be it a donkey or a sheep or a bird, against the skin of which she rubbed her body. And it was rare that the animal could survive, then the woman would come out, and they gave her a dung, she threw it in front of her, after which she could touch the perfume or the like”.

Malek said: "If it is necessary, Kohol or other medicine is allowed there, because the religion is easy to practice".
(1274) 118 - Nafe' reported that Safia Bint Abi Oubaid was suffering from pain in her eyes, being in mourning at the death of her husband Abdallah Ibn Omar. She didn't use the Kohol although her eyes were going to be closed with dirt. Malek said: "The woman whose husband is lost, can use sesame oil and fat, or the like, unless they contain perfume." Malek also said, “The woman whose husband dies should never put on adornment jewelry, namely a ring, or an anklet or other jewelry. She will also not put on clothes with colored fabrics or embroidery, unless these clothes are of coarse fabric or black in color. She will still comb her hair only with lotus or something similar, namely with what will not leave traces on her head”.

Having put the traces of the tamarind on his eyes, he said to him: “What are you doing, O Oum Salama”? “It is only tamarind, O Messenger of Allah,” she replied. He shot back, "Put it on at night and wipe it off by day." Malek said: “Grieving for a woman who has not yet reached puberty at the death of her husband is the same as for a grown woman, and will even have to s 'prohibit everything from which the adult woman is prohibited'.

MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 30 The subject of breastfeeding. Chapter One Infant Breastfeeding
(1277) 1 - Amra Bint Abdul Rahman reported that Aisha, the mother of the believers told her that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was in her home when she heard a man asking for permission to enter Hafsa's house. Aisha said, “O Messenger of Allah! There is a man asking to be allowed to come back to your house”. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "I see that he is so-and-so, a paternal uncle to Hafsa by nursing relationship". Aisha replied, “O Messenger of Allah! If such a man, my paternal foster-uncle, were alive, could he come into my house? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (On him the grace and peace of Allah) answered: “Yes certainly, because the connection of breastfeeding imposes the same prohibitions as childbirth”.
(1278) 2 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that Aicha, the mother of the believers said: “My paternal uncle by milk came to ask permission to enter my house. But I refused to allow him to enter, before asking the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) about it. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) having come, I asked him and he replied: "He is your uncle, you could allow him to enter". I said to him: “O Messenger of Allah! But it was a woman who breastfed me and not a man! He replied, "He is your uncle, let him come into your house." Aisha said: "It took place after the revelation of the verse concerning the veil" finally she said: "Breastfeeding is for the same prohibitions as childbirth".
(1279) 3 - Ourwa Ban Al-Zoubair reported that Aicha, the mother of the believers told her that Aflah, brother of Aboul-Kou'ais came to ask her for a permit to enter her home, he who was her brother by breastfeeding, and that after the verse of the veil has been revealed". She said again, “But I refused to let him in. But when the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) entered, I told him what I had done, and he ordered me to allow him to enter. .
(1280) 4 - Thawr Ibn Zaid Al-Daili reported that Abdallah Ibn Abbas said: "even if it is a single sucking, in two years it will make breast-feeding relatives prohibited for marriage".
(1281) 5 - Amr Ibn Al-Sharid reported that Abdallah Ibn Abbas, when asked about a man who had two wives, one of whom nursed a boy and the other a girl, if that boy can marry this girl"? He answered; “No, because the husband is the same”.
(1282) 6 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "Breastfeeding is only allowed to those who have had it, as infants, and is forbidden to adults".
(1283) 7 - Nafe' reported that Salem Ibn Abdallah Ibn Omar told him that Aisha, the mother of the believers, sent him as a child, to his Sister Oum Kulthoum Bint Abi Bakr Al-Siddiq, saying to her: "Breastfeed - the ten complete meals so that, once he grows up, he can enter my house, without permission”. Salem added: “Oum Kalthoum breastfed me for three meals and then fell ill without her being able to complete the ten planned meals. Thus, I could not enter Aicha's without her permission, because Oum Koulthoum had not breastfed me for ten meals”.
(1284) 8 - Nafe' reported that Safia Bint Abi Oubaid told her that Hafsa, the mother of the believers had sent Assem Ibn Abdallah Ibn Sa'd to her sister Fatima Bint Omar Ibn Al-Khattab to breastfeed him for ten meals, when he was still an infant so that he could later, grown up, enter her home without his permission. Fatima having done so, Assem entered Hafsa's house, without having permission”.
(1285) 9 - Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported that his father told him that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) brought into her house, without permission, those whom her sisters and his brother's daughters, had breastfed, which was forbidden for those who were breastfed by his brothers' wives”.
(1286) 10 - Ibrahim Ibn Ouqba reported that he asked Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab, about breastfeeding'? Sa'id replied: “Any breastfeeding done, even if it is from a drop of milk, in the first two years imposes a prohibition. However, what is given beyond two years is considered only food to eat”. Ibrahim Ibn Ouqba added: “Then asking Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair on the same subject, he gave me the same answer as that of Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab.
(1287) 11 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab say: "Breastfeeding is only necessary for an infant in the cradle, because beyond this period, the food is more valuable for the development of flesh and bones. (.....) 12 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab said: "Breastfeeding, whether for a short period or a long period, imposes prohibitions". - Yahia reported and I heard Malek say: “Any breastfeeding whether quantitatively little or too much, in the first two years, imposes prohibitions. But, after this period, the breastfeeding of a large quantity either it or a small one, will not prohibit anything, because it is taken for food”. Chapter II Of the breast-feeding of the grown-up
(1288) 13 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab was asked about breastfeeding the great one. He replied: "Ourwa Ibn Al Zoubair told me that Abu Houzaifa Ibn Utba Ibn Rabi'a, who moreover was one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) with whom he had attended the battle of Badr, had adopted Salem known as Salem, the freedman of Abu Houzaifa as well as the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) ( Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had done it for Zaid Ibn Haritha. Abou Houzaifa, taking Salem as a son, marries him with the daughter of his sister Fatima Bint al-Walid Ibn Utba Ibn Rabi'a, who at that time was one of the first women who had made the hijra, and was one of the most beautiful single women in Quraish. Immediately Allah Most High revealed in His Book the following verse: "Call these adopted children by the name of their fathers, it will be more just with Allah, but if you do not know their fathers, they are your brothers in religion. , they are yours” Koran XXXIII, 5. Each of these adopted children was called in the name of his real father, and in case the latter was unknown, the child would be known by the name of his father who named him. had adopted. Thus, Sahia Bint Souhail, the wife of Abou Houzaifa who was from Bani Amer Ibn Louay, came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and said to him “O Messenger of Allah! We had held Salem as a child and being such, he entered my home while I was without a veil having only a one room house, what do you think about him”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: “Breastfeed him for five meals from your breast and you will be forbidden to him”. “And she took him from then on for a suckling son. Aisha, the mother of the believers, being aware of this fact, she followed him with all those whom she wanted to bring into her home without their permission. So she asked that it be followed by her sister Oum Kalthoum Bint Abou Bakr Al-Siddiq and by her brother's daughters, for those they liked to bring into their home without taking their permission. As for the other wives of the Prophet (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) they refused to let those who had been breastfed in this way enter her house without giving them permission and said: “No, by Allah! What the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered Sahia Bint Souhail to do, was only such a special authorization, so that she breastfeed Salem alone . No, by Allah! We will not allow any man to enter our house, having been nursed in this way”. Such was the way of acting, of the wives of the Prophet (on him the grace and the peace of Allah) concerning the breast-feeding of the great”.
(1289) 14 Abdallah Ibn Dinar reported: “A man came to find Abdallah Ibn Omar, whom I was accompanying in the court of justice, asking him about breastfeeding the big child? Abdallah Ibn Omar answered him: “A man came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab saying to him: “I had a slave with whom I was living, my wife had breastfed her, wanting to have relations with the slave, my wife cried: Take care, for by Allah I have breastfed her. Omar, thus, says: “Tease your wife, and have intercourse with your slave because breastfeeding imposes prohibitions only if it is proper to infants.
(1290) 15 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that a man said to Abu Musa Al-Ach'ari: “I sucked my wife's breast and swallowed the milk”. Abou Moussa answered him: "I think that your wife is forbidden to you". Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud said: “Pay attention to what you have just said to the man” Abou Moussa replied: “what are you saying to yourself”? Abdallah Ibn Massou'd answered: “Breastfeeding imposes prohibitions only if it is given during the first two years of the infant”. Abou Moussa then said: "don't ask me any more questions, as long as this scholar is present". Chapter II Everything that says about breastfeeding
(1291) 16 - Aisha, the mother of the believers reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Breastfeeding calls for the same prohibitions as those of childbirth”. (1292) 17- Aisha, the mother of believers reported that Joudama Bint Wahb Al-Assadia told her that she heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him be grace and peace of Allah) say: "I intended to forbid men cohabitation with their wives and ejaculation, as long as their wives were still suckling their infants, when, I remembered that this was done by the Romans and the Persians, without it not cause harm to their children. - Malek said: "It is, interpreting the hadith above, that the man has relations with his wife, while she is breastfeeding".
(1293) 18 - Amra Bint Abdul Rahman reported that Aisha, the wife of the Prophet r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Among the verses revealed in the Quran, one of them concerned the prohibition caused by the ten breastfeedings, then it was reduced to five full meals. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) died, and had recited this verse so much as part of the Qur'an”. Malek said, "And we don't follow that among us." MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 31 The Book of Sales Chapter One Pawnbroking
(1294) 1 Amr Ibn Sho'aib reported from his father, from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) prohibited pawnbroking". - Malek, interpreting the hadith above said: "What I think, and Allah is most informed, that for the pledge, it is about the fact that the man buys himself a slave, or even that 'he rents a mount, then he says to the one from whom he bought or rented: "I will pay you a dinar or a dirham or more, or less than this price, provided that if I keep the goods or use the mount, the sum I would have paid you will be part of the price of the goods, or of the mount; and if I no longer want to buy myself the goods, nor rent the frame, what you would have had as a sum paid, will not be your right”. a - What is followed among us (in Medina) is that it is accepted that man buys himself the eloquent and gifted slave for commercial affairs in exchange with other Ethiopian slaves or even with other origins which do not have the eloquence of this slave, nor even his commercial skill, nor either his conviction, nor finally his knowledge. Thus, it is permitted to buy this slave, to exchange it for two or more others, for a well-determined time. However if, later on, he shows himself to be different, the slightest rapprochement which will be underlined, is enough for his exchange against two to be canceled even for a limited time. And it is the same for the difference of origins. b - It is tolerated that one can resell what one has bought before taking it, if this price has been collected from another man who is not the one from whom the purchase has been made”. c - It is not allowed, in the event that the sale of a woman is made, to make her exempt from the child she has in her bosom, because this is an abused bargain, by way of ignoring whether it is a male or a female, whether it is beautiful or ugly, whether it is a complete or incomplete creature, whether it is alive or dead, therefore it will devalue the price of this woman”. d - For the case where a man who buys a slave for one hundred dinars forward, then the seller regrets this sale and asks the buyer to declare the contract void, paying him ten dinars cash or forward, and regarding the hundred dinars as cancelled, Malek said, “That is valid. But if the seller regrets and asks the buyer to cancel the purchase of the male or female slave, by paying him ten dinars in cash or at term, in addition, in a date that exceeds the expected term, this does not is not allowed. In other words, it is as if the seller sold the slave at one hundred dinars for a period of less than one year, and at ten dinars in cash or at a term for a period of more than one year. This means that it is the sale of gold against gold that ultimately comes into play. e - Concerning the man who sells a slave to another, for one hundred dinars, to be paid in time, then he buys her at a price exceeding that of the sale price, for a period beyond that of the term, this is not tolerated. And this is explained by the fact that either the man sells the female slave for a well-determined period, then buys her for a period exceeding the first, so that he sells her to thirty dinars at a term of one month and that he buys it at sixty at a term of one year, or six months. Thus, it is as if his merchandise came back to him as it was, and the other man gave him thirty dinars for a month, sixty for a year or even for six. However, this is not tolerated”. Chapter II The Subject of the Property of the Slave
(1295) 2 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "Whoever sells a slave possessing a sum saved, this is the seller's right, unless the buyer stipulates it". Malek said: "What is followed among us (in Medina) is that if the buyer stipulates what slave he owns, it must be returned to him, whether it is cash or in the form of debt or commodity, determinate or indeterminate. And if the slave has a sum of money exceeding that of the price by which he has just been bought, the purchase price of the slave is made either by cash or by a debt or even a commodity. . Because, what the slave owns, his master will not have to pay Zakat on his behalf, just like the case where the slave owning a slave can cohabit her by his right of possession. If the slave is freed in a definitive way or in the long term according to a clause, his possession belongs to him, and in the event that he goes bankrupt, his creditors can monopolize his possession, without his master taking responsibility for paying him. his debts, if he has any. Chapter III Guarantee
(1296) 3 - Abdallah Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm reported that Aban Ibn Osman and Hisham Ibn Ismail alluded in their preaching to the guarantee of slavery, within three days beginning the purchase of the slave (male or female) and the one-year warranty". - Malek said: “What can happen to a slave, in the first three days they have been bought, is the seller who bears the responsibility. But if during a year given as a guarantee, there would be an attack of madness, or leprosy or the loss of a limb due to an illness, after this year has passed, the seller is exempt from all responsibility”. - Malek added: "An heir or another who sells a slave without there being a guarantee clause, this seller is no longer responsible for any defect, and he has no more to hold guaranteed, unless he was well aware of a defect and does not admit it. Thus, if he had thus acted, his indemnity is of no interest to him, and what he had sold must return to him. And this guarantee is only required here (in Medina) when it comes to selling slaves. Chapter IV The Disadvantages of Slaves
(1297) 4 - Salem Ibn Abdallah reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar sold a slave he owned for eight hundred dirhams, and Abdallah ibn Umar stipulated that he was not responsible for any fault in the slave. The buyer said to Abdallah Ibn Omar: "This slave is affected by a disease that you did not tell me about". They argued and went to Osman Ibn Affan to decide, the man said: "He sold me a slave with a vice without him admitting it to me", and Abdallah on his part said: "I sold with the stipulation that I was not responsible for any defect in the slave". So Osman Ibn Affan demanded that Abdallah Ibn Umar swear to him that he had sold him the slave free from any vice he knew; Abdallah refusing to take an oath, he took back the slave who, at home, was cured. Then Abdallah sold it again for one thousand five hundred dirhams”. - Malek said: "What is followed with us (in Medina), in case someone buys a slave, cohabits her and makes her pregnant, or buys a slave and later frees her, or any other in the event that what is purchased is no longer subject to return, and that the evidence is put in evidence, namely that what was purchased had been affected by a defect while it was with the seller, or even if the seller admits that there was such, or that another witnessed it, it is necessary that the slave, male or female, be evaluated while taking into account the defect they had, the same day they were sold, the seller will give the buyer a price agreed to be split between the true price (the male or female slave considered in a safe and sound condition) and the current price (i.e. that this or that slave have some defect). - Malek also said: "What is practiced with us (in Medina) in the event that the man buys the slave, then finds him some defect which gives him the right to return it to the seller, but still that this slave while being with the buyer has been affected by another defect, namely for example that this defect is either the amputation of one of the members of this slave, or that the latter has become blind or not any other form close to this defect, it is necessary, this case being, that the buyer has to choose: or that he decreases the price of the slave considering his defect of a value equivalent to this defect, of the same day where he had bought it, or if he wants it, that he pay to the salesman the value of the vice reached by the slave when it had been of his possession, then that it returns it to the salesman. If the slave dies while being with the buyer, its price is estimated at the value it had on the day of purchase, taking into account its default. Thus, if the value of the slave, the very day of his purchase, and being free from any defect, was one hundred dinars, and that this value, the day of his purchase with the defect, was eighty dinars, one would give the buyer the value of twenty dinars, who would thus have paid four and twenty dinars, the suitable value of the slave, taking into account his default”. Malek said: “Whoever returns a slave for having found any vice in her, but whom he had already cohabited, when she was a virgin, he must, in this case, take into account the reduction in her price for the to have cohabited. But if it was previously cohabited, he would not have to take this cohabitation into account and will owe nothing to the seller who had given him the guarantee. - Whoever sells a slave, or even an animal by compensation, to those who inherit or to others, the seller will be exempt from all responsibility regarding any defect found for what he has sold, except if he was aware of this defect and that he had not declared it. If this is so, his indemnity will be of no interest to him, and what he had sold must be returned to him”. - In the event that a slave is sold in exchange for two others, then there is in one of her, any defect for which she will be returned, Malek said: "We will make the evaluation of the slave against that there was exchange with two others, and one will estimate its price, then one will make the evaluation of the two slaves, exempt from the vice which was in one of her, namely that the evaluation will be made by considering the two slaves in a safe and sound condition. Then, we will distribute the price of the slave, against whom we had exchanged two other slaves, by esteem of their prices, so that each of them has its true value, taking into account that which is much safer than the other, therefore, one will consider the one in which one has found the defect, in order to deprive it of its value, whether great or small, to restore it to the 'purchaser by indemnity, so that each of the two slaves is valued according to its true price, the day of its sale'. —About the man who buys a slave and employs him long-term or short-term for wages and food, and then finds some fault in him and thereby returns him, his buyer will have to him his salary and his food. And such was the rule followed in Medina. On the other hand, if a man buys himself a slave who builds him a house the value of which is worth several times that of the slave, then he finds in the latter some defect enabling him to return it and to have again its price; the slave in this case, will have no wages for the construction which he had made, and such will be its situation if one had made it work with another person, since the salesman had guaranteed it against all vice. And such is the rule followed with us (in Medina). - For the man who buys several slaves in a single batch of a single transaction, and among whom, it turns out that a slave has been stolen (before he takes possession of it) or that he is even suffering from any vice, this man will have to fix the price of what has been stolen, or of what is suffering from a vice, and if this slave is the most expensive or the best among the others, or even that it is because of him, that the transaction has been made, or that people have had no esteem for him, this transaction will be completely canceled. But if it happens that a slave has been stolen or affected by a defect other than the first slave, without having his qualities, this slave alone will be returned by giving his price once he has been valued". Chapter V The Female Slave Sold While Subject to a Condition
(1298) 5 - Oubaidallah Ibn Abdallah Ibn Utba Ibn Mass'oud related that Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud bought himself a slave from his wife Zainab Al-Thaqafia, who gave her to him on condition of reselling her to him at the same price that will be offered on the day of the sale, Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud asked on this subject, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab who said to him: "you will not be able to touch this slave, as long as her sale is subject to a condition".
(1299) 6 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "Man should not cohabit with a slave, except that he can sell her, that he can make a donation of her, that he can even hold her, or that he can do with her what he wants". - Malek said: "Regarding the one who buys a slave on the condition of having neither the right to sell her, nor to make a gift of her, nor to do the like, it is not permitted its buyer to cohabit it, consequently, he will not even have the right either to sell it, or to offer it as a gift, since it is not absolutely his own possession because there is a condition which deprives him of disposing of this entire slave, thus, such a sale is detestable”. Chapter VI Prohibition of a man cohabiting with a slave who already has a husband
(1300) 7 - Ibn Chehab reported that Abdallah Ibn Amer had offered as a present, a slave to Osman Ibn Affan, having a husband, and that he had bought her in Basra. Osman told her, "I won't touch her until she separates from her husband." So Ibn Amer agreed with the husband of this slave to compensate him, and he separated from her”.
(1301) 8 - Abu Salama Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Awf reported that Abdul Rahman Ibn Awf had bought himself a slave, finding that she was married, he returned her”. Chapter VII Of the sale of fruit trees and their fruits
(1302) 9 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever sells date palms pollinated, the fruits in return to the seller, unless the buyer stipulates them in the conditions of purchase”. Chapter VIII Prohibition against selling fruit before it begins to ripen
(1303) 10 - Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade the sale of fruits before they begin to ripen. And this prohibition was to be followed by the seller and the buyer”.
(1304) 11 - Anas Ibn Malek reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbade the sale of the fruits before they were colored” . One asked the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) on what he means by colored? he answered: "let them blush" and he added: "What do you think, it is possible that Allah does not allow the fruits to ripen, will one of you have the right to take the money from his brother".
(1305) 12 - Amra Bint Abdul Rahman reported that the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade the sale of the fruit as long as it is in doubt their ripening”, (eu escaping from the plagues). Malek said: "The sale of fruits before they are completely free from diseases that could destroy them is considered a random sale".
(1306) 13 - Kharija Ibn Zaid Bint Thabet reported that Zaid Ibn Thabet, his father, sold the fruits only just at the appearance of the pleiad (that is, at that time, one can distinguish the color of the fruits, especially if they are dates". - Malek said: "what is practiced among us (in Medina), concerning fruits such as watermelons, cucumbers, Khirbiz and carrots, it is is that their sale is allowed in case they are ripe and good to eat then, the buyer will have, all the right on what grows on the trees until these lose all their fruits or that they do not are more edible, and this for a period which is not to be fixed, because it is a period which has been agreed upon by people. But if ever these fruits are damaged, and that they are no longer in a state to be consumed, even before the period previously provided for, if this is the case, and that at least one third of these fruits have deteriorated, the buyer must be discount equal to or greater than one third depending on the case. Chapter IX Of the sale of “Al-Aryya”^
(1307) 14 - Zaid Ibn Thabet reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) allowed the recipient of a date palm called Arya to sell its fruit , while being on the tree, after estimation, against fruits already picked”.
(1308) 15 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) tolerated the owner of the "Al-Arya" (a kind of dry date )that their fruit be sold while still on the tree, exchanging it for picked fruit, in case the weight is less than five awsouqs. Daoud doubts whether it is five awsouqs or less. - Malek said: “Al-Arya” date trees are sold by estimating their dates, namely that one will consider approximately and one will estimate the dates as long as they are on the trees. And this tolerance is due to the fact that dates are held in the same way as a charge, or a resolution of a contract or even an association. If the dates were considered as any other commodity, no one, in this case, will have accepted that another does not share them with him, before he takes possession of them, or before he rescinds a contract. , or even that he charges someone else, before he has fully received the price”. Chapter X Of the scourge that ravages fruits and harvests
(1309) 16 - Muhammad Ibn Abdul Rahman heard his mother, Amra Bint Abdul Rahman say: "a man, in the time of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him be grace and peace of Allah), had bought himself the fruits of a garden, which he tended well, until a plague ravaged the fruits of this garden. This man asked the owner of the garden either to forgive him of his debt or to rescind the contract, the owner of the garden, taking an oath not to do such and such, the buyer's mother went to the Envoy of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) tell him about this. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Has he taken an oath not to do good anymore"? The owner of the garden, hearing this, came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and said: “O Messenger of Allah! The choice is his”.
(1310) 17 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz demanded that the value of the fruits, or the harvest, damaged by a plague be subsidized”. - Malek said: "And such is the rule followed at home (in Medina)". - Malek added: “This subsidy will only be made if the spoiled part or quantity is one third of the harvest”. Chapter XI Permission to hold part of the bumper crop
(1311) 18 - Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman reported that Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad, sold the fruits of his garden, making the exception of a part”.
(1312) 19 - Abdallah Ibn Abi Bakr reported that his grandfather Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm sold the fruits of a garden he owned called "Al-Afraq", for four thousand dirhams, and kept a quantity of dates aside, worth eight hundred dirhams".
(1313) 20 • Muhammad Ibn Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Harith reported that his mother, Amra Bint Abdul Rahman sold his fruits, keeping aside a certain amount”. - Makk says: "What is followed with us (in Medina) is that, in selling the fruits of his garden, the man has the right, to keep aside a quantity of these fruits, which does not is not beyond a third, but that this quantity is more than a third, this is not permitted”. - Malek added: "it is not forbidden for a man to sell the fruits of his garden, setting aside a certain quantity of these fruits, namely the fruits of one or more date palms which he chooses himself, citing their number. Because, the owner, by setting aside some trees, he wants to keep their fruits for him, and not sell them, preferring to sell other fruits from his garden. Chapter XII The sale of dates which is not permitted
(1314) 21 - Ata'Ibn Yassar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Dates in exchange with other dates, equal to equal”. He is told: "Your prefect in Khaibar": exchange one Sa' of dates for two". The Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: "Do you exchange one Sa'de dates for two (namely dates)"? The prefect answered: “O Messenger of Allah, those who sell me, do not give me a sa' of dates of a good quality for a sa' of an inferior quality”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) ordered him: "To sell the dates of different qualities exchanged for money, then to buy with this money dates of good quality".
(1315) 22 - Abu Sa'id Al Khudri and Abu Houraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) had appointed a man in Khaibar who would had brought so-called "janib" dates (which are of good quality). The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: “All the dates of Khaibar, are they of the same quality”?. The man replied, "No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, the sa' of such dates is exchanged for two, and two Sa's for three." The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: "Do not do this anymore, sell dates of different qualities and take money in exchange, then buy of this money, janib”.
(1316) 23 - Zaid Abu Ayash reported that he asked Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas about the exchange of barley for rye”? Sa'd said to him, "which is more valid"? Zaid replied, "That's barley." Sa'd forbade him and said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the mercy and peace of Allah) say about the exchange of fresh dates for the dry ones: "Fresh dates, once dried, will they lose weight"? He was told that yes, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) forbids this kind of exchange”. Chapter XIII Of the “muzabana” and “al-mouhaqala”
(1317) 24 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was against “al-muzabana”. Al “mouzabana” is the fact of selling dates on the date palms for dry dates, and selling grapes on the vines for raisins”.
(1318) 25 - Abu Sa'id Al Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) refuted "the muzabana" and "the muhaqala" . And “la mouzabana” is the sale of dates on the date palms for dry dates, and “la mouhaqala” is the fact of renting the land in exchange for a quantity of wheat”.
(1319) 26 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) forbade "muzabana and muhaqala" ( see hadith above), emphasizing that 'muhaqala' is either selling the harvest in exchange for wheat, or renting the land in exchange for wheat”. Ibn Chehab, asked Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab about the land leased against gold and silver, Sa'id replied: "It is permitted". Malek said: “The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has prohibited “the muzabana” and “the muzabana” which is explained as follows: “Any form of sale is said to be random as long as during the sale the weight, measure and number are unknown. By way of example, a man possessing food whose weight cannot be specified, such as wheat or dates or anything similar to them, or even possessing wheat, or fresh dates, or vegetables, or safflower, or linen, or cotton, or silk or anything similar to them, in short that he has everything of which we cannot specify either the weight or the number, and that a man comes to tell the possessor of all this merchandise: “Weigh this merchandise, or ask someone to weigh it, or weigh what can be weighed, or even count what can be counted; thus if what is measured from such and such lacks a sa', or even if what is weighed from such and such lacks a certain weight, or even what is counted from such and such is lacking, in short all that is missing, I will take it at my expense, whatever the goods designated; and if there is a surplus of this merchandise, I will take it without paying the price. Thus, I guarantee that what is lacking of this commodity is my possession, and is even equivalent to what is surplus. However, this is not a sale but it is a sale of risk, chance and wear and tear, because during this sale, he does not pay the price of a well known and specified commodity, which he bought, but he at least guaranteed himself to have what is said of measure, weight and number, of this merchandise by taking possession of what was in surplus. But if this commodity lacks what is of these units (measure, weight, number), the one who bought it, should have taken from the owner of this commodity, what is priceless, or even what is of a donation, which, in fact, he does not have the right to have because it is usury, or something similar to it". - Malek said: "It is still done that the man says to the other having the fabric: I guarantee you that with such fabric, you will have to make such number of caps, in such a way that each one will be of such or such unit of measurement, which he quotes. If it is less than the designated piece of cloth, I will give you what is missing so that you have the full number, and if there is more, it will come back to me”. - Or again, always on the subject of the fabric, that the man says to the other: I guarantee you to make of such fabric, such number of shirts, of which each one will be of such or such length; but if this fabric is missing, I will give it to you so that you have the number, and if there is more, you will give it to me». - Or even, that the man says to the other, about the leather, that it is of cows or camels: "I assure you to cut this leather, in order to make according to this pattern a hundred pairs of sandals, if the number is less than a hundred, I will complete it for you, and if it is more, this superfluity I will have it free because I have guaranteed it». - Or again, let the man say to the other who has “ban” seeds (Egyptian willow): “By pressing this ban, you can extract such and such a weight of perfumed oil, or if the weight is less, I will give you what is missing, and if there is more, I will have it for myself". “Thus, all these forms of sale are “la mouzabana”, in other words, sales that are neither permitted nor tolerated”. It will be the same in case the man says to the other, possessing leaves of trees, or stones, or flax, or cotton, or safflower, I will buy such and such a kind of your merchandise. , by Sa', proceeding just as it was mentioned in the previous hadiths, everything comes down to what is quoted from the muzabana”. Chapter XIV The Sale of Fruit
(1320) 27 - Malek said: "Let a man buy dates from designated palm trees, or from a designated garden, or let him buy milk from certain definite sheep, so that the buyer will take this he has bought, as soon as he has paid the price, there is no prohibition. This is similar to the case where a man buys oil from a wineskin, at the price of one or two dinars, thus giving his money and signaling to the seller to weigh him some oil from this same skin, there is no prohibition. But in the event that the skin splits and its oil leaks, the buyer will take back his money, and consequently there will be no obligation to sell between him and the seller”. “But what is for any commodity that is bought at the same time, such as milk that is milked, or dates that are picked, namely that the buyer can have them from day to day, it is a purchase that is tolerated, since the quantity purchased is well known; but in case it is ravaged before the buyer takes possession of it, or the seller will keep the price of the goods already sold, or the buyer will have the difference of the sum of money already paid, at the price of another commodity after having agreed with the seller on this subject, and that this takes place at the same time, before the buyer and the seller are separated because in this case this is not tolerated. Because, if the separation took place before they both agreed, this is refused because the goods in question are subject to the payment of a term sum, but it is forbidden that goods are delivered after a certain time. Therefore, a transaction is tolerated if the goods are submitted for a certain time already fixed, thus, the seller will guarantee the buyer the delivery of the goods without it being necessary to specify whether, for example, they are dates from a well-designated garden, or from the milk of well-determined sheep". Malek was asked about a man who buys dates from a garden of different kinds of palms namely "from Ajwa, from Kabiss, and from Azq", and other kinds of dates, that the seller makes the With the exception of a few date palms, Malek replied, "That is not tolerated, for by doing so he would have taken a measure of fifteen sa's from the 'ajwa' against a measure of ten sa's from the Kabiss, preferring such kind to such another, namely that "the ajwa" is less valid than "the Kabiss". His case is similar to one who, having a quantity of dates, neither measured nor weighed, will make three batches: the first consisting of fifteen sa's of "ajwa", the second of ten sa's of "Kabiss", and the third of twelve sa's of "azq", that the buyer subscribes the seller of a dinar, provided that he himself chooses the batch of dates", this is not allowed, added Malek". - Malek, was questioned, about the man, who having paid in advance a dinar, to the owner of the palm trees, so that he can buy fresh dates, then for some reason, that the palm trees are ravaged , he replied: “Let the buyer make his account with the owner of the palm trees, then let him have what is his duty of the dinar already paid; and that depends on three cases: if he had bought fresh dates at the price of two-thirds of the dinar, he is entitled to the remaining third; if the dates bought fresh were at the price of three-quarters of the dinar, he will have the remaining quarter, or else that they have agreed, buyers and owners among themselves, namely that he can, if he wants to, buy at the price that remains to him, fresh dates, or other merchandise than dates. This, on the condition that they cannot be separated from each other, before the buyer has received from the owner either the dates or another commodity. - Malek added: “This case above is similar to the same situation where a man lends to another either his mount by renting it to him, or his servant to have a dressmaker or a carpenter work for him or perform n any other work, or even that he rents his house to him, in such a way that the first has in advance the payment of the work of the servant, or the rental of the house, or the mount, after which an accident of death, or from what is unforeseen arises. Thus, the owner of the mount, or the slave, or the house must return to the other man the price paid in advance for the mount, the slave, and the house, for a sum relatively decent. to what has already been used of what is rented, which for example is an amount of half a little less or a little more”. - Malek said about this advance: "It is tolerated only if the object which is subjected to it, is well known and determined namely a mount, a slave, or a house which one delivers just to the payment of in advance, without there being any delays or delivery at a certain time. The interpretation of the refusal of this payment in advance is clearer in the following case: "Let a man say to another: I will pay you such sum in advance, for your mount which I will use to accomplish the pilgrimage , while a good time still separates him from the heard pilgrimage, or the same for his slave or his house. This done, it is as if the one who pays in advance, was going to pay money, because if it happens that the mount is still in a good state in order to use it for the pilgrimage, this mount is rented, and if it is no longer because of death or other reason, the owner of the mount must return to the man the sum paid, from which he had in any case benefited". And Malek added: “Now, there is a distinction to be made between this fact above (advance payment returned) and the fact of definitely receiving a sum. Whoever receives the price of what he has rented is no longer accused of a random sale, because it is payment in advance, for a known thing. This case is similar to the man who buys a slave, so he appropriates them and pays their prices immediately, if any incident will affect them during one year of their possession, their owner can have again the amount paid, from the seller; so, for this case, there is no harm; moreover, such was the sunna followed for the slave trade. Malek finally said, "He who hires a known slave, or a well-appointed mount, which will be delivered to him in a fixed date, that is not permitted, for by this act he will have paid a sum for a thing which is not in his possession on the day of payment and that the owner can only guarantee on the day of delivery. Chapter XV The Sale of Fruit
(1321) 28 - Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina) is as follows: Whoever buys fruits, fresh or dried, can only sell them after paying their price (d purchase). He can only sell them, exchange them for each other from hand to hand. hand in hand or such fruits against such others if they are of the same species. If they are of different species, it is tolerated that two quantities are sold for one, from hand to hand, and without any delay. If there are fruits which cannot be dried, nor to make a supply of them, but which are eaten fresh such as watermelons, cucumbers, carrots, oranges, bananas, and pomegranates and any other similar fruit, so that, if even dried, they are no longer considered fruits, nor of what one can stock up and they are fruits, I think one can sell a quantity for two and from hand to hand on the market even without it being in the long term". Chapter XVI The Sale of Minted and Powdered Gold for Silver
(1322) 29 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) allowed the two Sa'ds (namely Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas and Sa'd Ibn Oubada) the sale of the vessels of the booty, made of gold and silver selling three vessels for four measures of coins, or four vessels for three measures of coins, the Messenger of Allah ( salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to them: "You have committed usury, this sale must be returned".
(1323) 30 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: “A dinar is worth another, and a dirham is worth one another, without any preference from one to the other".
(1324) 31 - Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Do not sell gold exchanged for gold, unless one is worth the other, and one of you does not give more than the other. Do not sell either, silver exchanged for silver unless one is of the same value as the other, and one of you does not give more than the other. Do not sell a commodity present against another absent (or non-existent).
(1325) 32 - Mujahed reported: “He was at Abdallah Ibn Omar, a jeweler came and said to him: “O Abu Abdul Rahman, I work gold, I sell it more than its weight is, earning thereby value of my work. Abdallah forbidding him to do this, the jeweler kept repeating the same subject and Abdallah for his part forbade him, until he was at the door of the mosque, or even near a mount to be mounted, then Abdallah Ibn Omar said to him: “The dinar against another, the dirham against another, without preference from one to the other. Such was the commitment of our prophet (on him the grace and peace of Allah) towards us, and such will be ours for you”.
(1326) 33 - Malek Ibn Abi Amer reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said to Osman Ibn Affan: "Do not sell the dinar for two, nor the dirham against two”.
(1327) 34 - Ata Ibn Yassar reported that Mu'awia Ibn Abi Souffian had sold a gold or silver vase, where water is cooled, at a price higher than its weight. Abu Al-Darda said to him: "I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) prohibit such a sale unless it is made, by equivalence of weight ". Mou'awia replied, "I find no harm in that." Abu Al-Darda continued: "Mu'awia answers me according to his opinion, whereas I have just reported to him a hadith according to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him grace and peace of Allah); to whom do I owe my apologies? I refuse to be in the same country where you are”. Then, going to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, Abu Al-Darda told him what had happened; so Omar Ibn Al-Khattab sent in writing to Mu'awia: "avoid such a sale, unless it is made at equivalence of weight".
(1328) 35 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “Do not sell gold against the other, except at equivalence, and without preferring one to the other. Do not sell silver for silver except in an equivalence, and without preference from one to the other. Do not sell silver for gold if one of these two metals is present while the other is not. If one of you asks the other for a certain time so that he can return home, he should not grant it to him, for I fear for you the practice of usury”.
(1329) 36 - The above hadith was narrated by Abdallah Ibn Dinar from Abdallah Ibn Umar”.
(1330) 37 - Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "one dinar for one dinar, one dirham for one dirham, one sa' for one sa' and not to sell a present item for another who is not".
(1331) 38 - Abu Al-Zinad reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Mous-saiab say: "Usar is only in the sale of gold or silver, of which is measured or what is weighed, of what is to be consumed or drunk".
(1332) 39 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab say: “The exchange of gold and silver is corruption in the world of the living”. - Malek said: “There is no harm in a man buying gold for silver, and vice versa, whether it is gold dust or wrought articles. On the other hand, concerning dirhams and accounting dinars, it is not suitable for a person to buy them, as long as he does not know the nature and the number of these coins. If we buy them at a fixed price, we will have practiced usury, since we have neglected to count them, consequently it is not a sale practiced by Muslims. But, there is no harm in selling at a flat rate what is weighed gold powder or worked jewels, which is not the case, if one wants to buy them at a flat rate. For it is considered as wheat, dates and similar other food which can be sold on credit, as long as it is weighed or measured”. Malek finally said: "Whoever buys with dinars or dirhams, a Koran or a sword or a ring, encrusted with gold or silver, the value of the item purchased will be estimated by fixing the value of the precious material thus if the article is valued by two thirds and that the precious material is by one third, this is tolerated, provided that the purchase is made on the spot, and without any delay; It is the same for the article bought with the money”. “And such is, from time immemorial, the rule followed among us (in Medina)”. Chapter XVII The subject of change
(1333) 40 - Ibn Chehab reported that Malek Ibn Aus Ibn Al-Hadathan Al-Nasri was looking for a change with someone one hundred dinars. Malek continued: “Talha Ibn Oubaidallah summoned me, and made me the exchange, taking the dinars in my hand, then said to me: “Wait until my cashier comes back from “Al-Ghaba” so that I can exchange them for you. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab being listening to us, said: “By Allah, you will not leave him until you have collected your money”, then he continued: “the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Sur him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "exchanging gold for silver is usury except from hand to hand!", likewise wheat against wheat is usury except from hand to hand! hand!”, even dates against dates, subject to usury, except from hand to hand!” and barley against barley where there will be usury, except from hand to hand!”. - Malek said: "If the man changes dirhams for dinars, then finds that one of the dirhams is falsified, and intends to return it, all the change is to be canceled, and everyone will take back their change". The interpretation of the refusal of this exchange is due to the fact that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Exchanging gold for silver , is usury, except hand to hand!”. And Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “And if he asks you to give him some time, so that he can enter his house, do not allow him. If he returns you a dirham in exchange, after he has left you, this is taken for a debt or for a sum to be paid at term. Such is the cause, for which this exchange is refused. And Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had refused to sell gold for money, or for food as a whole against a sum to be paid in time, because it is not suitable to sell the same commodity for a same species or of different species if payment is not made on time". Chapter XVIII Of the sale made after a weighing
(1334) 41 - Yazid Ibn Abdallah Ibn Qoussait reported that he saw Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab weighing his gold, pouring it into one of the pans of a balance, and his companion was doing such in the another tray. As soon as the equivalence between the two trays was made, each of them took the gold from the other”. - Malek said: "What is followed with us (in Medina) for the sale of gold for gold, and silver for silver, is to be made by weighing namely that the one will have ten dinars against eleven others, from hand to hand, if the weight is of an equivalence in the two trays, and even if there is a difference in the number of pieces; The case will be the same for silver coins which are dirhams”. ; - Malek also said: "Whoever, exchanging gold for silver, finds that there is a difference in weight as regards the gold exchanged, and in compensation he will give to his companion , the difference in money or with another commodity, the latter must not accept it, because this is refused, to be usury, Thus, if it were tolerated for the first to have the surplus by paying the price, as if he had bought his share, he would be tolerated to buy it for his express price, making the sale lawful. And if the seller was going to give him this excess separately, the buyer would not have taken it, not even for the tenth of his real price which he had paid, by tolerating this kind of sale which will only be in a certain way to make licit what is illicit, which justifies that it should be prohibited”. - Malek added: "Regarding the man who exchanges pure gold coins by adding them with poor quality gold powder, against broken gold coins called "Koufia", and who is moreover repelled by people. That the two men make a transaction by this exchange, Malek does not allow it, interpreting this prohibition as follows: "The owner of the pure gold coins added with the gold dust does not seek to profit from these coins provided that he can make the gold powder flow, otherwise the other would not have accepted such a transaction, where he exchanged "his Koufia". This case is similar to a man who wanted to buy three sa's of “ajwa” dates in exchange for two sa's and a moudd of “Kabiss” dates. Telling him that this exchange is not allowed, he offered to give two sa's of “Kabiss” dates, and one Sa' of “hachf” dates, believing thus to make the exchange legal. However, even there, the exchange is not allowed because the owner of the "ajwa" would not have accepted to give him a sa' of such dates for a sa' of hachf, if he did not want to have other so-called “Kabiss” dates which are more valid To highlight another example where a man says to another: “Sell me three sa's of white wheat in exchange for two sa's and a half of brown wheat”. The other, answering him, that this is suitable only by exchanging his' by his', the first will have two sa's of brown wheat and one sa' of barley exchanged, thus seeking to return, between: them, the lawful transaction”. Now, even this transaction is repugnant, because the first would not have given a sa' of barley against a sa' of white wheat, if this sa' was exposed all alone, however he had agreed to make this exchange, because the wheat brown is superior to white wheat. It is an example similar to what was previously said about gold dust. - Malek definitely said, "So anything that is gold, silver or food, in short, what is not allowed to be exchanged except on par, it is not unsuitable about them, which is added to the goods of good quality, and which, moreover, is well appreciated by everyone, of the goods of mediocre quality, so that the sale is considered lawful; therefore, in doing so, or making lawful what is not. As long as what is mediocre has been mixed with what is well appreciated; the seller thereby seeks to convince of the good quality of what he sells”. Chapter XIX On the sale at interest and what is similar to it
(1335) 42 - Abdallah Ibn Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "He who buys food, will not be able to resell it only when he has taken possession of it".
(1336) 43 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever buys food, should not resell it, before it is in his possession”, thus, he cannot expose for sale mediocre merchandise, which, if it had been designed to be sold on its own, it would only be bought because it had been mixed with other good quality merchandise. Now, it is unseemly that gold, silver and food should be sold in this way, therefore, whoever wants to expose for sale a mediocre commodity, let him do it, but keeping it apart from all other merchandise, with which he is forbidden to mix it. This being done, there is no harm”.
(1337) 44 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: "It is a fact, that in the time of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) we bought ourselves food (for merchandise); so the Prophet (salallahou alayhi wa salam) sent us someone ordering us to move from the place where we had bought the food, to another so that we resell it”.
(1338) 45 - Nafe reported that Hakim Ibn Hizam bought food that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab offered to people. Hakim, having sold this food before he had possessed it, and this was learned by Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, he returned it to him, saying: "never resell a commodity that you have just bought, before it not be in your possession".
(1339) 46 - It was reported to Malek that titles had been given to the people of the time when Marwan Ibn Al Hakam was governor, for food originating from "Al-Jar". People having exchanged among themselves, these titles before the food was in their possession, Zaid Ibn Thabet, and one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him grace and peace of Allah) went to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam, and said to him: “O Marwan! How do you make usury lawful? He exclaimed, “I take refuge with Allah! What are you talking about"? They answered him, "About these titles, which the people exchanged with each other, before they possessed the food." So Marwan sent his guards, searching for these titles, snatching them from the hands of the people, and delivering them to their original owners”.
(1340) 47 - It was reported to Malek that a man wanted to buy food from another, for a certain time. The seller, accompanied the one who wanted to buy food, to the market, showing him different kinds of food, and said to him: “What kind do you want to buy”? The buyer replied, “How do you sell to me what you don't own? Then both went to Abdallah Ibn Omar, telling him what had happened. So Abdallah Ibn Umar addressed the buyer and said: “Do not buy from him, what he does not have? Then addressing the seller, said to him: “Do not sell what you do not own”.
(1341) 48 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Jamil Ibn Abdul Rahman the muezzin say to Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab: "I am a man who buys with the will of Allah the food vouchers of al-Jar, which are given to people, then I try to resell the food that I myself had guaranteed, at a certain time”. So Sa'id said to him, "Are you looking for that way, to get rid of this food before you have possessed it"? The other replied that yes, Sa'id forbade him”. - Malek said: "What is followed with us (in Medina) and which, moreover, is confirmed, is that whoever buys food such as wheat, barley, rye, maize , millet or other oleaginous grasses or the like, which in fact are subject to zakat, or even edibles such as oil, fat, honey, vinegar, cheese , sesame, milk or other foodstuffs which are similar to them, the purchaser, in the event that he wishes to resell such merchandise purchased, may only resell it after having possessed it and even paid the price”. Chapter XX On refusing to sell food, at a certain time (1342)49 - Abu Al-Zinad reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar, making the prohibition of sell, with a certain delay, wheat for gold, by which he will subsequently buy dates, even before he has possessed the gold in question”.
(1343) 50 - Malek reported that Kathir Ibn Farqad asked Abu Bakr Ibn Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazem about a man who sells food for gold, with some delay in delivery, then he buys with this gold, dates, before he possessed the gold? Abu Bakr was against such a sale and banned it”. (.....) 51 - Ibn Chehab was of the same opinion». - Malek said: "However, Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab, Abu Bakr Ibn Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm, Ibn Shehab, prohibited the fact that a man sells the wheat exchanged for gold, with which, he will buy dates, and that before he has possessed the gold which is due to him as the purchase price of the wheat. This is explained by the fact that he must buy with gold, the selling price of wheat, with a certain delivery time, dates from another seller than the one to whom he sold his wheat, and that before he owns the gold, then he makes a delegation of debt between the one from whom he bought the dates and the one to whom he sold the wheat, to recover the gold in question, this is tolerated” . Malek said, "I asked many of the learned men on this subject, and they all approved of it." Chapter XXI The advance made for the purchase of food
(1344) 52 Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar said: "It is tolerated that a man advances to another, well-qualified food, at a fixed price, and for a fixed time, unless it is a harvest whose quality cannot be determined, or dates whose nature cannot be known”. Malek said, "What is followed with us (in Medina), about advanced food, at a fixed price, and made for a time, and the time be over, if the buyer does not find not at the seller, the food requested, he will cancel this transaction by taking back his silver or gold, which he had previously paid to the seller, or even the price at its full value. And he won't be able to buy with what he paid for, any goods, until he had the full amount paid. Because, if he takes back other than the sum paid, or if he leaves it with the seller from whom he buys a commodity other than food, he will have bought food even before he possessed it”. Malek continued: “And the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had forbidden the sale of the food before it was delivered (and the seller has taken possession of it). Malek added: "If the buyer regrets this purchase, saying to the seller: 'Cancel this sale and I will give you some time to return the amount I paid you, this is not allowed, and men of science disapprove of it. For as long as the food may be in the possession of the buyer, at the order of the seller, and he has not yet taken it, for the purpose |of canceling it, such food shall be sold to a certain period of time before it is possessed by the buyer'. - Interpreting this, Malek says: "in case the buyer, the term ended, refuses the goods having its price one dinar for a certain time, this is not considered a repeal of the sale-purchase contract, as long as neither the seller asked for more nor the buyer gave more. And if this surplus is present and is payable at a certain time, or if the seller and the buyer ask and give something more from which one of them will benefit, it is not either more repeal. However, it would be repealed if there has been a sale on either side. On the other hand, abrogation, association and delegation have been tolerated, as long as they present neither surplus, nor diminution, nor adjournment; consequently if these last cases exist, that turns to a sale, subjected to the tolerances and the prohibitions”. - Finally Malek said: “Whoever advances a quantity of brown wheat, it is good that he receives it after the time has ended. It will be the same for the advance of any other species, where it is allowed that it has a better or lower quality, once the time limit is over. This is interpreted as follows: “Whether the man advances a quantity of wheat, it is good that he takes back in exchange for barley or brown wheat. Whether the advance made is “ajwa” dates, it is still to be exchanged for so-called “saihania” dates (mediocre and dry dates) or a heap of different qualities. Whether it is red grapes, it is to be exchanged for dry black grapes, provided that all these exchanges are accomplished after the time has expired, and that the measure thereof is equal to equal”. Chapter XXI The sale of food exchanged for another without distinguishing between them
(1345) 53 - It was reported to Malek that Soulaiman Ibn Yassar related: "The supply of the donkey of Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas being exhausted, he said to his servant: "Take wheat from your parents, and exchange it for barley, and let it be of equal quantity.
(1346) 54 - Nafe' reported that Soulaimnan Ibn Yassar told him that, the supply of the donkey of Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Aswad Ibn Abd Al-Yahouth, was exhausted, he said to his servant: "Take wheat from your parents, as food, in exchange for which you will buy barley, and take only an equal quantity".
(1347) 55 - It was reported to Malek that Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad and Ibn Mu'aiqil Al-Dawsi acted similarly”. - Malek said: "What is followed with us (in Medina) is that we do not sell wheat for wheat, nor dates for dates, nor wheat for dates, nor dates for raisins, or wheat for raisins, or any such food, unless the sale is by hand. Because, as long as there is a delay in the transactions, the sale is no longer legal, but rather illegal. And let this be followed for all other food, if it is not exchanged from hand to hand”. - Malek also said: "One cannot sell food of the same kind, in such a way that two quantities are exchanged for one, for example: that a mudd of wheat is exchanged for two mudds, neither a mudd of dates against two, nor a mudd of raisin against two, nor any other grasses or foods that are of one kind, even if it is made by hand. For this is considered analogous to the sale of silver for silver, and gold for gold, where what is lawful will be absent if there is a surplus, but present if the sale is made in equal proportion and hand to hand". - Malek continued: "If the food, intended to be eaten or drunk, has a difference in measure or weight, and therefore this difference is quite distinct, it is agreeable that the exchange of a measure be made against two, but hand to hand. Thus, it is correct to exchange one sa' of dates for two sa's of wheat, one sa' of dates for two sa's of raisins, one sa' of wheat for two sa's of fat. Thus, if the two species are different, it is agreeable to sell two measures in exchange for one, or even more, of the hand by hand. But, if there is a delay (between delivery and payment), everything will be illegal”. Malek finally said: - It is not lawful to exchange an indeterminate quantity of wheat for another of the same species, but on the contrary, if the exchange is made from hand to hand for a quantity of wheat against a another of dates, and it is even tolerated that wheat is randomly sold for dates". * Consequently, any difference highlighted for two kinds of food, will make it possible to buy them, as a whole, in a random way and from hand to hand. But if the deadline is at an end, it is better not to do so, because buying randomly is like the still random buying of silver by gold. However, whether wheat is randomly purchased for silver, or dates for gold, this is lawful and good”. * On the other hand, he who piles up food, knowing its weight well, sells it to a buyer, without him admitting it to him, this is not allowed. Now, the case being, the buyer can deliver the food to the seller, lest he has been deceived, ignoring the weight. Such is still the case, for all that the seller knows about and of the weight and measure of food and other merchandise, and yet the random sale, without the knowledge of the buyer. Thus, if the buyer is willing, he can return to the seller what he bought. Well-versed men constantly prohibit such a way of selling”. * It is not good to sell bread one loaf for two, nor one large for one small, if some are larger than others. However, it is sought that the loaves be of the same size, so that the exchange is made on an equal basis, this is permitted, even without weighing them”. * It is not allowed to sell one mould of butter and one mould of milk for two moulds of butter. This is similar to what was quoted about the dates sold, two sa's of "Kabiss" dates and one sa' of "hachaf" dates in exchange for three sa's of "ajwa" dates, when a man said to a another: "I will give you two sa's of 'Kabiss' dates for three others of 'ajwa', thereby seeking to sell off his goods. The same applies to the owner of butter and milk moulds, who wants to benefit from the other person, of a butter mould, which is superior to the milk mould”. * It is permitted to sell wheat exchanged for flour, on equal terms, because the flour has already been stripped of the bran. Even in the case where half a mound of flour, mixed with half a mound of wheat, to be exchanged for a mould of wheat, this is the same as the cases mentioned above (i.e. milk and butter, loaves of bread), for therefore it is not permitted because this exchange of half a mudd of flour aims to have, on the other hand, a half wheaten mudd which is superior to it”. Chapter XXIII The sale of all the food
(1348) 56 • Malek reported that Muhammad Ibn Abdallah Ibn Abi Mariam said to Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab: "I buy myself food by titles of "Al-Jar", but sometimes I buys against a dinar and a half dirham (by these titles) where they give me half of the food”. Sa'id answered him: "No, it is better that you give yourself a dirham, and for the rest, take food".
(1349) 57 - It was reported to Malek that Muhammad Ibn Sirin said: "Do not sell the grains while they are in their ears before they have become thick". - Malek said: A - When a man buys food for a specific price, and at a definite time, then that time ends, and the seller says to the buyer, "I don't own the food that I promised you, so sell it to me for a fixed time", the buyer replies: "This is not tolerated because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and the peace of Allah) forbade the sale of food before it was possessed". The seller replies: "Sell me this food for a fixed time so that I can pay for it", this is still prohibited because it is as if he gave him food so that he could take it back , and the gold which he had given him shall be the price of what he owed, and the food which he had given him shall become lawful. Such a transaction, if carried out, will consist of selling food before having possessed it”. B - Concerning the man who owes food from another, and that the latter owes it likewise from a third; that the second says to the first: "you will have to negotiate, about your food, with another, who owes me the same food which is moreover of the same value as that which you owe me". Malek said, “doing so is forbidden, as it is a way of selling food before it is possessed. However if the food is already possessed, it will be allowed that there is negotiation between the first and the third, because this case does not present any more an action to sell, for the good reason, that it is well known, the prohibition to sell a food before it is possessed. This is, therefore, in accordance with the refusal of the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) concerning the above subject, while men versed in religion considered admissible the association, the delegation, and the avoidance of the contract, when it is a question of food. They have also likened this case to an act of good without taking it for a sale. As such, they gave the example of a man who lends another man dirhams whose weight is lower than the legal standard to later have them dirhams whose weight is legal; this is tolerated even if there is a difference in weight. But that he buys dirhams of an inferior quality to have after others which are legal, this is not tolerated. It is also forbidden for him to lend dirhams lower than what is legal and intends to take them back after the determined time, other dirhams of legal weight”.
(1350) 58 - What is similar to the cases, cited above, is what the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has forbidden the subject of the so-called "Al-Mouzabana" sale, and allowed for Al'araya, namely to sell fresh dates against dry dates by distinguishing them: Al-mouzabana involves damage, on the other hand the sale of al-araya is said an act of good”. - Malek said: A - It is not tolerated for a man to buy food at the price of a quarter or a third or even a fraction of a dirham, provided he has this food after a while. But it is benevolent that he buys himself food by a fraction of a dirham so that he has this food after a determined time, then that he gives a dirham so that he has a commodity among many. others, for what remains to him of the value of his dirham, because he had given the fraction he owes, in money”. B - It is tolerated that a man keeps in reserve at another, a dirham, then that he buys a commodity determined for the value, or of the quarter or the third or of a fraction of this dirham”. But, if in this case the price is not fixed and the man will say: "I buy myself goods according to the price of every day", this is not allowed, because it is random , where the seller can either increase or decrease the price as he pleases. All the more so since they did not separate by agreeing both on the quantity of the goods and on its price”. C - When a man randomly sells a commodity, without discarding any part of it and then goes to buy a part of it, this is not tolerated unless this part purchased is subject to a fixed exception of less than the third. In case this part exceeds one third, it will be the mouzabana that is repelled. Thus, what is tolerated is at the limit of a third, and this is what is an undisputed norm with us (in Medina)”. Chapter XXIV Of hoarding and waiting
(1351) 59 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “Global is forbidden in our markets. Men having within their reach the goods that Allah has granted us, and that they are in our markets, will not have to monopolize them. On the other hand, any man having brought a commodity, carrying it, winter and summer, on his back, this one is the guest of Omar: that he sells it as he wishes it or even that he retains it”.
(1352) 60 - Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab passed by Hateb Ibn Abi Balta'a, while he was selling his raisin in the market”. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said to him: “Either you sell according to the current market price, or else you leave our market”.
(1353) 61 - It was reported to Malek that Osman Ibn Affan, forbade hoarding”. Chapter XXV Permitted sale in respect of animals of the same species, and the advance paid on them.
(1354) 62 - Hassan Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ali Ibn Abi Taleb reported that Ali Ibn Abi Taleb sold a camel he owned, called 'Us-saifir', for twenty camelets, at a specified time.
(1355) 63 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar bought himself a camel against four camelets which are guaranteed to him, while having to discharge with "Al-Rabza".
(1356) 64 - Malek reported that he asked Ibn Chehab about the sale of one animal for two, eventually? Ibn Chehab replied, "That is tolerated." - Malek said: * What is followed with us (in Medina) is that we tolerate the sale of a camel for the same camel, by paying dirhams more, from hand to hand. It is also tolerated the sale of a camel against another camel, and that the dirhams paid in addition, are paid in time. On the other hand, it is not good that one camel is sold against another, in the long term, and that the dirhams paid in addition are paid as a cash sum. It is not good either, that the camel and the dirhams are delivered in time”. * It is good that one buys a camel of good breed, exchanged against two or more others of an ordinary breed from a herd of camels even if they are of the same species. It is even tolerated that one buys one camel against two in the future, provided that they do not show themselves clearly different, or on the contrary completely similar, with the variation or not of their species, because in In this case, it is not appropriate to sell forward, one, against two”. * The interpretation of this refusal, is explained by the fact, that this exchange during the sale, of a camel against two, showed that there is neither superiority of race, nor power of load . Thus, if these two distinctions were not found, it is not necessary that one buys oneself in the long term, two for one. But it is tolerated that we sell what we bought, before it was possessed, to someone other than the one from whom we bought, if the price was paid to the latter”. * Whoever pays in advance, for an animal, in the long term, and that he has made the description of this animal, this is tolerated. Consequently, this becomes an obligation for both the seller and the buyer for having made the description of this animal. Moreover, such a way of haggling is always followed by people, and even admitted, by the men versed among us (in Medina)”. Chapter XXVI Animals which it is forbidden to sell
(1357) 65 - Nafe'a narrated that Abdallah Ibn Umar said that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) forbade the sale of what is worn by a female, and that she will give birth. It was a sale followed in the pre-Islamic era, where a man bought a carrying camel with the aim that she give birth and that the latter will in turn give another camel.
(1358) 66 - Ibn Shehab reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said: “Never practice usury in the trade of animals. And we had forbidden this under three conditions: the sale of what the females carry, the mating of the stallions, and the female for what she carries and that she will give birth to”. - Malek said: "One should not buy an animal which is described, and which is not present, even if he had previously seen and accepted it, paying its price, and that its possession be done sooner or later". This is refused, for the good reason that the seller has already taken advantage of the price, without knowing whether or not the goods in question are still in the initial state, as fixed by the buyer. This explains the refusal; on the other hand, this refusal is an admission, if the price is paid on condition that the animal to be sold, is such as it was described”. Chapter XXVII Of the sale of animals for meat
(1359) 67 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab said that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade the sale of animal for meat.
(1360) 68 - Daoud Ibn Al-Hussain reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab say: "Among the games of chance, practiced in pre-Islamic times, there was the sale of the animal against meat, and mutton against two".
(1361) 69 - Abu Al-Zanad reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab said; “We had forbidden the sale of the animal (live) against meat”. - Abu Al-Zanad also said: "Then I spoke to Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab, saying: what do you say, about a man who bought an old camel for ten sheep"? Sa'id to answer: "If he bought it to sacrifice it, it is not good". And, added Abou Al-Zanad: "People I have known, have prohibited the sale of the animal against meat", and Abou-Zanad concludes: "And this had been prescribed to the prefects, of the time of Aban Ibn Osman and Hisham Ibn Ismaïl, to prohibit the sale of an animal against meat". Chapter XXVIII Meat sold for meat
(1362) 70 - Malek said: "What is the unquestionably followed standard among us (in Medina) concerning the meat of camels, cows, sheep, and all animals like them, is to barter only of equal for equal, or of equivalent weight, taking delivery immediately. It is also tolerated that we barter meat, without having weighed it, provided that we have fixed the exchange of hand to hand. - Malek added: “It is tolerated to barter the flesh of fish, against that of camels, cows, sheep, and other animals, in the equivalence of two measures against one and in an immediate way. But if this is done in time, there will be no good”. Malek finally said: “As for the flesh of the poultry, I conceive it different, from the meat of the herds and from the fish. Thus, it is tolerated that we buy it in order of preference. However, this flesh should never be sold in the long term”. Chapter XXIX Of what is the price of the dog
(1363) 71 - Abu Mass'oud Al-Ansari reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) forbade profit from the price of the dog, the reward of the prostitute, and the wages of the seer”. And he means by the recompense in question, the price paid for fornication, and for the fortune of the seer, the bribe he receives so that he predicts. - Malek said: "I disapprove of the price of the dog, whether hunting, or otherwise, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was against ". Chapter XXX Advances and Sale of Commodities Mixed with Each Other
(1364) 72 - It was reported to Malek that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) has forbidden any sale conditional on an advance”. Malek, interpreting this, says: "Let a man say to another: I will buy at such price, your goods, on condition that you advance me such sum, the contract of sale concluded according to the example above, is unacceptable. But, if the one who had laid down the condition of an advance, abandons it, this contract would be accepted”. Malek added: "There is no harm if a man buys himself a garment of 'linen' (or 'Chatur' or 'Qassabi' in exchange for one or two or even three garments of the kinds or "Itribi" or "Qassi" or "Ziqa" or "Harawi" or "Marwi" or even Yemeni clothes or izar, but whether it is skillfully done or in time. In case these clothes are of the same fabric , forward sale, is wear and tear. Also, it is inappropriate to sell one item of clothing for two, forward, unless they are clearly different, for if they are more or less the same and they are of by the name of the different fabrics, that is always inappropriate, for example that one sells in the long term two garments of the "Harawi" for a garment of "Qouhi" or of the "Fourkoubi" for a garment of the "chatwi". it is made that these kinds are of the same quality, it is forbidden that one buys two clothes against one, in the long term." - Malek finally said: "It is tolerated that one sells what one is purchased by paying the pr ix and before taking possession of it, of the third person”. Chapter XXXI Advance made for the purchase of goods
(1365) 73 - Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad reported that he heard Abdallah Ibn Abbas say - when a man asked him about another man, who paid in advance, the price of articles made of linen , counting on selling them before having possessed them”? That this sale of money for money, is, answered Ibn Abbas, prohibited”. - Malek on this subject, answered: “There, I think, and Allah is most informed, that , this man was seeking to sell the articles of the merchant from whom, he had bought them, to the same merchant at a much higher price, than their purchase price. However, if he was going to sell them to another person, that is permitted”. - Malek said: "The norm unquestionably followed in Medina, is the following: "concerning, the one who pays in advance and on time, the slaves, the herds or other goods, so that the whole is qualified, if the date is due, the one who bought what is quoted above, cannot sell anything to the one from whom he bought, and especially of a higher price in comparison to what he had paid in advance for sum, before having possession of that sum in question. And if he acts contrary, it will be usury, as long as the buyer having given the seller dinars or dirhams in advance, from which the latter had benefited, on the appropriate date, the buyer reselling the same goods to the seller before having ownership of the latter, the buyer would in this case have collected the sum paid in advance and an additional sum, and this is usury”. ' - Malek added: 'Whoever pays in advance and on time, gold or silver to buy a herd or other qualified goods and the date is due, it is tolerated that the buyer sells part of his merchandise to the seller, against others (who are not of the same nature as the merchandise already purchased), but that it be done immediately, whatever the price. However, this is no longer tolerated, if it is food, because it is only lawful for him to sell it, once he has possessed it. Consequently, the buyer will be able to sell this commodity to someone who is not necessarily the seller from whom he bought this food, against gold or silver or any other commodity, of which he must immediately take possession without any delay. Because, if he takes possession of it late, it will not be good, and it constitutes a sale of a debt against a term debt, concluded with a third person (i.e. who is no longer neither the buyer nor the seller). - Malek finally said: A - He who pays in advance, the price of a commodity which is neither food nor drink, and that it is done in time, this buyer, can sell it to which he desires for money or other merchandise, even before he has possessed it from the seller; but, he must not sell what he has bought, to the seller, unless it is exchanged for a commodity to be possessed without any delay”. Before the date of delivery, it is tolerated for the buyer to barter it from the seller, against goods of a different kind, and for this difference to be clear, and also, for him to immediately take possession of this new merchandise. B - The one who pays in advance, and eventually, dinars or money, to buy four pieces of quality fabric, on the due date, these pieces cannot be found at the seller's, and the buyer finds there 'other pieces of fabric of lesser quality, then if the salesman says to him: "I sell you, in exchange against the four pieces, eight others of another fabric", this is tolerated. Thus, if the buyer immediately takes these eight coins before he separates from the merchant, this is tolerated. However, it is not appropriate to make this transaction either before or even on the due date, unless the parts exchanged are different from those for which the price has been paid in advance”. Chapter XXXU The Sale of Copper, Iron, and Like Metals by Weight (1366)74-Malek said: - The rule followed among us (in Medina), concerning what is sold by weight, exception of gold and silver, namely red or yellow copper, lead, and tin, iron, vegetables, figs, cotton, or other products similar to them and sold by weight, it is good to skilfully sell the same kind, two weights for one, for example two weights of iron, for one weight of the same metal”. - However, it is not good, that one sells, in the long term, two weights against a weight, of the same species, of any product quoted above. But if they are different, and that this difference is clear, it is tolerated that the sale is made for two masses against one mass, and in the long term. On the other hand, if they are close, by their category, and even if they are of different names such as lead and tin, red copper and yellow copper, I disapprove, says Malek, that we sell eventually two weights against one”. - On the other hand, when you buy all the products mentioned above, it is tolerated even before owning them to sell them to a third party, as long as you collect the price, and on condition that you bought by weight or measure". “But if the purchase was made without taking any measurement of the goods, sell these products to a third person in cash or on credit, because the guarantee is imposed there. However, this guarantee will no longer be obligatory if the sale is made after having weighed or measured the products and after they have been received”. "And that's the best I've heard about it, and people keep following it back home (in Medina)." - What is followed for what is measured or weighed, and which is neither to be eaten nor to be drunk, such as: safflower, pits, tree leaves, myrtle and other species which are similar to them, it is that it is tolerated that two quantities of the same species are sold for one, provided that this is not done in the long term. But if the two species differ and their difference is clearly perceived, it is tolerated to sell two quantities against one, but in the long term. And all that one will have bought of these products, it is tolerated that one sells them to a third person, on the condition of having taken possession of it and to have touched the price of it. - And all that people sell for profit as products even if it is small pebbles or plaster, if they are sold, two quantities against one, in the long term, it is usury; or even that it is a quantity against a similar and something else in addition, done in the long term, it is also wear and tear”. Chapter XXXIII Prohibition against making two kinds of sales in one
(1367) 75 - It was reported to Malek that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade making two kinds of sales in one”.
(1368) 76 - It was reported to Malek that a man had said to another: "Buy this camel for me for cash, so that I can buy it from you in due course". Abdallah Ibn Omar, questioned on this subject, refused such a sale and prohibited it”.
(1369) 77 - It was reported to Malek that Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad had been questioned about a man who had bought a commodity at ten dinars in cash or at fifteen dinars in advance”. al-Kassem, had rejected such a purchase, and forbade it”. - About a man who had bought from another, a commodity, either at ten dinars cash, or at fifteen forward, and that the buyer will have to opt for one of these two prices, Malek said : “This is not tolerated, because if it means that the ten dinars will be paid later, they will have to be paid at the value of fifteen; and if he pays the ten dinars in cash, it is as if he had bought what is worth fifteen dinars forward”. - Malek was questioned about a man who bought from another, a commodity, either at ten dinars in cash, or for a specific good quality sheep, at term, and that the buyer, therefore, must opt for one of the two prizes", he replied: "This is not tolerated, and is refused, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) has prohibits two sales made in one. And the sale in question is an example of this. - For the man who said to another: "I will buy from you, for one dinar, fifteen sa's of "ajwa" dates or ten sa's of "Saihania" dates, or fifteen sa's of deliverable wheat, or ten sa's of brown wheat, and I owe one of these goods", Malek said: "Such a sale is prohibited, because, by the price which he fixes, the buyer gives himself the choice to take what he wants, preferring by example the fifteen sa's of "ajwa" to the other ten of "Saihania", or fifteen sa's of ordinary wheat to the other ten of brown wheat. This is similar to what is prohibited for two sales made in one, and again what is inadmissible regarding the sale of the same kind of food, two quantities against one, and to have at the same price”. Chapter XXXIV The Random Sale
(1370) 78 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade the random sale”. - Malek said: - What is random and still a form of bet is that a man, having lost his mount or his maroon slave, the price of which is fifty dinars, that another says to him: “I will buy it from you at the price of twenty dinars”, in case the buyer finds it, the seller will have lost thirty dinars; or if he does not find it, the seller will have received the sum of twenty dinars from the buyer”. “On the other hand, it is vicious for another reason, in the event that what was lost is found, but while being changed a little or too much, or even having suffered some defect, this constitutes a great risk”. - However, what is followed with us (in Medina), and which is considered as random, the purchase of what women and females wear; for one cannot know whether what is worn will be brought into the world, and one cannot know whether it will be beautiful or ugly, of a complete or incomplete creation, male or female; and in all this there are preferences, from such to such, and its value will be such and such according to the state”. - Again, it is not tolerated to sell the females by putting aside, what they carry; that a man for example says to another: “the price of my dairy ewe is three dinars, but I will give it to you for two, provided that I have what it carries; but this is refused, because it is a random and risky sale”. - It is illegal to sell olives for olive oil, or sesame for oil, or fat for butter, because the mouzabana comes into play in this case. Even though a man buys himself grains or what is similar to them, against what he will be able to extract from these grains, not even knowing, if what is extracted is less or more, this is also random and risky”. - It is the same for the one who buys willow seeds against his raw oil, this is random, because what is extracted from the willow seeds is none other than its raw material. However, it is tolerated that willow seeds be exchanged for perfumed seeds, because the latter have been subjected to a transformation where they have been perfumed, dried, so that they are no longer in the state of a raw material". - On the subject of a man instructing another to sell him a commodity by fixing him a minimum price, Malek said: “Such a sale is illicit and is even random”. And this is interpreted as follows: “it is as if he hired him, for a profit, in case this commodity will be sold at a price exceeding that which had been fixed. But if it is sold either at the same price or less, and the effort of the buyer is in vain, this is not permitted. Because he is entitled to a salary evaluating the effort he had made for the sale. As for the seller, he will, on his part, be entitled to profit or loss, if the merchandise has been sold at a higher or lower price. On the other hand, he must assume the loss if this commodity remains unsold, to be subsequently sold at a lower price. But if the goods are still in demand, the sales contract will be cancelled”. - Malek finally said: “But if a man definitely sells to another, a commodity, after which the buyer will regret this transaction, saying to the seller: give me a discount” and the latter will answer him: "Sell it instead, and you won't lose", this sale is tolerated, because it is not random, because the difference in price will be borne by the seller even if it is not a term of the contract , and that is what, moreover, we are following in Medina”. Chapter XXXV The moulamassa” and “the mounabaza”
(1371) 79 - Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade "mulamassah and mounabaza". - Malek said: “the moulamassa is to allow the man to touch the fabric, without spreading it, thus ignoring, if there is a defect, or that he buys it at night, without 'he examined it well'. “And the mounabaza, is that one man lays out his cloth and another lays out his without one examining the other's cloth, then one saying to the other: such cloth against such; but this is what is forbidden from the moulamassa and the mounabaza”. - On the subject of the sale of Persian fabric in their envelope or the fabric says "Qoubti" all folded, Malek said: "It is not tolerated to sell them, only after having spread them, by examining them, otherwise their sale is random and precisely it is almoulamassa”. - On the other hand, the sale of pieces of fabric according to the catalog is completely different from that of Persian and Qoubti fabrics. This practiced sale that people have been following for a long time, imitating in this way, those who preceded them, is always allowed, because it is not designed to be random like the moulamassa, even if there has not been to spread fabrics”. Chapter XXXVI Selling for Profit
(1372) 80 - Malek reported: "What is followed with us (in Medina), about a haberdasher who buys clothes from one country, to sell them in another, aiming to make a profit", it is that he will have to exclude from the price: the sum to be paid for the brokers, the costs of bending and pulling, and the renting of the house. As for the cost of transporting these garments, they will be part of the initial price, without considering a profit, unless the seller informs the buyers; this being the case, if they can make him benefit from a certain sum, willingly, this will be tolerated”. - Malek said: “As for laundering, sewing and dyeing, they are to be considered, just like the case of clothes. The profit one earns on them is to be calculated just as it is done for clothes. In the event that the haberdasher sells the clothes without informing the buyer of the costs mentioned above, he is not owed any additional profit. Thus, if the clothes are not sold, the transport costs will be part of the price, without counting any additional profit, if the opposite occurs, any sale is to be eliminated, between seller and buyer, except if the latter s 'agree with each other on other items that may be purchased'. - About the man who buys goods for gold or silver, and that on the day of the purchase, the dinar was equivalent to ten dirhams, then that this man is in another country in order to sell them for a profit, or that he sell them in the same country, for the one from whom, he bought them, according to the exchange which took place on the very day of this sale”, Malek said: “ If he had bought them and paid for them with dirhams, and sold them for dinars, or vice versa, and the goods are still for sale, the buyer will have to choose: either to buy these goods or to buy them. leave alone. But if the goods are not sold, the buyer has the right to buy them according to the paid purchase price which will be the right of both. - If a man sells goods that he had bought for a hundred dinars, in such a way, to receive eleven dinars against the ten, as the selling price, then he realizes that the purchase price was not more than ninety dinars and that his goods are no longer sold, the seller will have the choice of receiving the value of his goods according to the price at which he sold them, unless this sum is higher to that to which he was entitled on the day of the sale; in this case, he does not receive more than the price, namely, against a hundred dinars, he will have ten more, or else a profit will be calculated for him taking into account the real price which was four and twenty and ten except if the value of the goods is lower than the actual value; in this case, he can receive a sum worth the real price of the goods, namely 90 dinars and a gain of ten for ceni which is nine, and thus, he will have an overall sum of four and twenty and ten and nine dinars”. - Malek finally said: "if a man sells a commodity for a gain, saying that he bought it for a hundred dinars, then someone comes and tells him after a while, that the buyer who had already bought this merchandise, in fact at one hundred and twenty dinars, the buyer will have to choose: either he gives the seller the sum which is the price of the merchandise, on the day of the sale, namely one hundred dinars, or he gives an amount equivalent to the sale price taking into account the gain he has obtained whatever it is, and which must not, in any case, be inferior in value to the purchase price, because he does not have the right to cause the seller a loss, given that the sale was concluded following a transaction made between the two parties. Because, in such a case, the seller may claim the difference in price and the buyer on his part cannot refuse it and make a discount of the purchase price according to the catalog”. Chapter XXXVII Sale according to a catalog
(1373) 81 - Concerning men who have bought a commodity such as clothes or slaves, and that a man was aware of this purchase, that he comes to say, to one of them: "The clothes that you bought from such a merchant, I already know their quality and their nature. Do you want, therefore, that I make you benefit from a certain sum concerning your share, for what is purchased? The other having accepted it, then the new buyer will make him benefit from a sum, and consequently, becomes, a partner in his place among men, in case, where the buyer examines the goods, and finds them ugly and unseemly; Malek said on this subject, "He must obligatorily discharge it, and will not be able to refuse any more, as long as he bought the goods according to a well described and known catalog". - Malek also added: "A haberdasher, having received a quantity of fabrics, and that the merchants are present at his house, he reads his catalog to them, saying: "With such a measure one can make a Basorian coat, with such another a "Sabria", and so on, so buy these stuffs, according to what I have just let you know". Then, the merchants buy these fabrics as they were described, realize later, by examining them, that they were paid at a high price, and regret that this purchase was concluded”. On this subject, Malek said: “This sale is assigned to them, as long as it has shown itself to be adequate in the catalog”. Moreover, it is the rule followed by people here (in Medina), that they never stop judging lawful between them, if what is bought is in conformity with the catalog, without it being different from it” . Chapter XXXVIII The optional sale
(1374) 82 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “A seller and a buyer, who, agreed between them on an optional sale, have the right to withdraw from the sale as long as they have not separated, except if the sale is not made at option”. Malek said, "The question of option, for us (in Medina), has no limit, nor a definite thing."
(1375) 83 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Mass'oud taught that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had said: "A seller and a buyer, who among themselves have concluded a sale and are arguing, we take into account what the seller stipulates, otherwise the sales contract is to be cancelled”. Malek said: "A man buys a commodity, and the seller stipulates, before the sale is concluded, that he must consult a third person in such a way that: "If the latter agrees, the sale is permitted. , otherwise, there will be no more sales”. The contract is concluded between them, then immediately after the buyer regrets it even before the seller has consulted, the third party", Malek says: "This sale is an obligation, according to what was agreed between them, by Consequently, the buyer does not have to choose, if the third person consulted agrees. - Malek finally said: “Let a man buy goods from another, then they both argue over the price, and the seller says: “I sold it to you for ten dinars” and that the buyer answers him: "no, I bought it at five", we will say, in this case to the seller: "If you want, you can sell it to him, at the price he has fixed, or else, swear to sell it to him only at the price you have just told him”. Now, if the seller swears, the buyer will be told: "Either you buy the goods at the price the seller has fixed, or you swear to buy them only at the price you have even fixed. If the buyer takes an oath, it is considered, in this case, that each of these two, the buyer and the seller, accuses each other”. Chapter XXXIX Usury Debts
(1376) 84 - Abu Saieh, the servant of “Al-Saffah” (the first of the Abbasite caliphs) reported: “I had sold for a certain period a garment which belonged to me to people of “Nakhla” (place in Medina). Then wanting to leave at Al-Koufa, they offered to pay me the cash price by making a discount? I was going to ask about this Zaid Ibn Thabet who said to me: "I order you not to do this, nor to allow others the right to do so".
(1377) 85 - Salem Ibn Abdallah reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar was asked about a man who eventually owes a debt to another, and asks the creditor to forgive him to discharge it before the date not be applicable”? He disapproved of this and even prohibited it.
(1378) 86 - Malek reported that Zaid Ibn Aslam said: “Usur, in pre-Islamic times, consisted in the fact that a man owed a debt to another, and if so, he said: “Want you pay it to me, or you will pay it later with interest”? Thus, if he pays the other will have what is his right; otherwise, he will grant him a delay, after the debt increases, of a certain interest”. - Malek said: "What is unquestionably repugnant to us (in Medina) is that a man having a debt to pay to another, the first, should remit to the second in order to recover his money before its term, which consequently is to be compared, in the case where a creditor will grant a delay to his debtor by increasing the debt by a surplus (taken for interest); but that is, no doubt, wear and tear». - Malek also said: “Concerning a man, who owes another a debt of one hundred dinars, and eventually; at the end of the date, that the debtor says to the creditor: "Sell me, a commodity at the cash price of one hundred dinars, and one hundred and fifty dinars in the future"; Malek replied, "It is a sale which is not allowed, and such is always what is repugnant, by well-versed men." - Malek finally said, interpreting the cause of this reluctance: "It is that the creditor would have, in this case, sold to the debtor, the goods at their real price, by delaying the payment of the hundred dinars, in the long term, this to which, he will add fifty dinars because of the delay. But this is repugnant, and inadmissible. By the way, this is to be compared, to what Zaid Ibn Aslam reported, regarding the sale in the pre-Islamic era, where once the debts were due on the date, they said: “Otherwise you pay , or your debt is increased; If he paid, the creditor took his due; otherwise, the debt was increased, by a certain amount of interest, to be paid on time”. Chapter XLL Debt and transfer of debt (to a third party)
(1379) 87 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam)r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Let a rich man delay, what he has to pay, is an injustice. If one of you receives a delegation, of debt on a solvent man, that he accepts this delegation.
(1380) 88 - Malek reported that Moussa Ibn Maissara heard a man ask Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab: "I am a man who sells on credit". So Sa'id answered him, "Sell only with what you need to get home." - Malek said: "Concerning a man who buys a commodity from another, on condition that he deliver it to him on a definite date, and this either for a fair where he wishes to sell it there, or for a necessity at the time designated then that the seller does not deliver it to him on the scheduled date, which will lead the buyer to return the goods". In this regard, Malek said: "The buyer will not have the right to do so, and he must pay the price of the goods purchased, because if the seller had delivered them to him before that date, the buyer 'would have accepted'. - Malek also said: "For the one who buys food, and he measures it or weighs it, then someone comes to his house, wanting to buy it for him, but the owner of the food informs him that he had bought for himself, and having even weighed it, the buyer believes it and wants to take it from him according to the measurement already made, paying the cash price". Malek in this regard says: “What is sold according to such criteria, is permitted; but if it is sold, according to this term term, it is repugnant, unless the buyer weighs or measures the goods himself. a way of practicing usury, although there is the risk that the goods are not of the same size or the same weight. And if this sale is made in time, it is repugnant, And there is no disagreement on this subject with us (in Medina)”. -Malek added: “One should not buy a debt from a man, whether or not he is present, if there is not a statement made on the part of the debtor, nor more a death even if we know what this death has left, because the fact of buying in this way is uncertain, especially since we do not know whether or not it is possible to complete this transaction” . As for the interpretation of this reluctance, it is explained as follows: "If one buys a debt from an absentee or from a dead person, one does not know what unknown creditor is attached to this debt, this . Thus, if the deceased owed a debt, the sum which had been paid will remain vain and useless”. - Malek finally said: “Let us underline, also, the presence of another vice: It is that he bought what is not guaranteed for him. And if what is bought is not delivered to the buyer, the price he should have paid would be vain and invalid. And it's still random, and it's not allowed. - However, added Malek, there is a difference between the fact that the man only sells what he possesses, and on the other hand, that the man advances for something that he does not in fact possess. . Whoever wants to buy a commodity takes his money, what he intends to buy and says: “What do you want me to buy you with these ten dinars? Now, acting as such, it is as if he sells them cash for fifteen forwards. It is for this reason that the sale is considered prohibited and is usury, even an imposture”. Chapter XLI Association, delegation (of debts) and termination
(1381) 89 - Concerning the man who sells several kinds of clothes, making an exception of some that are embroidered, Malek said: "If he wants to keep some of these clothes aside, he nothing wrong with that; but if he does not make a choice, with the exception of a few clothes, I believe that he becomes a partner in the clothes that are bought from him, because, it is possible that the two clothes in are embroidered in the same way, and yet their prices are different". - Malek said: “What is followed at (in Madinah) is that there is no harm in association, delegation and termination being particulated as far as food is concerned and other goods, whether deliverable or not, and the sale made cash, without profit, default or arrears of payment. However, if one of these three aspects is present, the sale will be lawful like any other sale, and prohibited for any prohibition found in the sale. Therefore, there will be no association, delegation or termination”. - Malek also said: "Whoever buys for goods, be clothes, be slaves, and that there is a man proposing to the buyer, that he is associated in this sale paying thus, both, the price of the goods. Subsequently, if the goods, for any reason, are no longer deliverable, in such a way that the partner asks for his money from the other, and the first in turn claims the full price of the goods of the seller, except that the first buyer asks his partner just after the sale and session done, telling him: "The deposit which is your own, belongs to the seller". But after separation and the first buyer has neglected this condition, he will bear all responsibility”. - Malek finally said: "Let one man say to another: buy this merchandise for both of us, equally, paying my share as regards the price, as for me, I will take care of it for you sell", this is not allowed, for the following good reason: "When the man says, let the price be paid by the other, as for him, he will take care of the sale, it is as if half of the price will be considered as an advance made to the second person, due to being responsible for the sale. On the other hand, if this merchandise is no longer valid, or it is no longer salable, the buyer will be able to have from his partner, half of the price he had paid him, and this value will be like a advance which will imply a profit (which is usury). But if a man buys a commodity, which is already his property, and another says to him: "Make me associated with this merchandise by paying me the price I owe, as for me, I will resell it to you" , this is licit, and is even tolerated. The interpretation of this means that it is a new sale which is accomplished by selling him half of the merchandise, and the other will later be the seller”. Chapter XLII Bankruptcy of the debtor
(1382) 90 - Abu Bakr Ibn Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Hareth Ibn Hisham reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "When a man, sells a commodity to another, and the one who has just bought it goes bankrupt, while the seller has not received anything from the price of the merchandise which is intact, the seller has more rights than the buyer, and can take back his goods. However, in the event that the buyer dies, the seller will be held to be a creditor”.
(1383) 91 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "The man who finds his goods as they are, he had sold to another who went bankrupt, the first has more right than anyone else to take back his goods". - Malek said: A - When a man sells a commodity, and the buyer goes bankrupt, if the seller finds his commodity as it is, he can take it back. If the buyer had already partially sold this merchandise, or even if he had distributed it, the seller will have the full right to take back the rest, without what has been partially sold of this merchandise preventing him from take it back. Even, if he wishes, he can return to the buyers what he received from the price. And as for the part that cannot be found, the seller will be a creditor in relation to the buyer who has made a deficit”. B - The one who buys any commodity, either weaving thread, or a piece of land or something else, then what is bought has been or worked - such as the fact of building a house on the land - or to make a fabric out of yarn, then the buyer made a deficit, leading the owner of the piece of land to say to the buyer: "I am buying this piece of land, including what is is not tolerated. Then we will evaluate the land, and what is built on it by the buyer, and we will fix both the price of the land and that of what is built on it, following which, the buyers will both be partners, emphasizing that the owner of the land will have what is his share, as for the creditors, they will have a share, what is built”. Interpreting this, Malek said, “Assuming that the assessed price is one thousand five hundred dirhams, then the value of the land will be five hundred, and that of what is built, one thousand dirhams. Therefore, the owner of the land will have one-third, and the other creditors, two-thirds. It will be the same with regard to weaving thread and the like, if they are worked and the buyer is indebted for them by a sum of which he cannot manage to get rid of them. acquit”. C - But for what is sold goods which the buyer had not worked on, except that their price has become higher, and that their owner is willing to keep them, as well as the creditors are willing on their part, the retain, these creditors will have to choose: either that they pay to the owner the price of the goods which he had sold, without reducing it, or that they return his goods to him. In the event that the price of the goods is reduced, the person who had optionally sold them may, if he wishes, take back his goods, without owing the creditors a share of his property; or he is to be considered as one of the creditors, so he will be entitled to a share of the goods, without having the goods”. D - Whoever buys a slave or a mount which begets at home, then he makes a deficit, the slave or the mount with his child must return to the seller, unless the creditors do not want to pay him the price of the slave or mount with its young, so that they retain them". Chapter XLIII Of what is permitted in advance
(1384) 92 - Abu Rafe, the freedman of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) owed a young camel, to a man, who came to ask for it; camels of alms, having reached the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) he ordered me to give the man his camel. Telling him that among the camels, there was not a camel of the same age, but another six years old, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to me: "Give it to him, for the best of you is he who fulfills the payment of the debt which he owes with the most liberality".
(1385) 93 - Mujahed reported that Abdallah Ibn Umar owed a man a certain amount of money, he gave him an amount exceeding that of the debt. So the man said, “O Abu Abdul Rahman, what you have just given me for the debt is much more than what you owe me”; then Abdallah Ibn Omar answered him: "I know, but I had done it with all my soul". - Malek said: "It is tolerated for him who has advanced anything concerning either gold, or silver or food or an animal, to receive from him who owes him, what is better than to which he advanced, if ever there was between the two, any condition proposed, or a custom. But if any condition or custom or anything is present, it is repugnant, and therefore does not bring any good." Interpreting this, Malek said, "The Messenger of Allah (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) had acquitted himself against a young camel that he owed, from another older camel and Abdallah Ibn Omar from a surplus debt. What is tolerated as long as there has been neither condition nor custom, therefore this is tolerated and licit”. Chapter XLV Prohibited advances
(1386) 94 - It was reported to Malek, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had made to another, a debt of food, in the condition that the second will return it to him in another country. And Omar said: "And the transport costs, who will take care of that?"
(1387) 95 - It was reported to Malek that a man, on his way to Abdallah Ibn Omar, said to him: "O Abu Abdul Rahman, I made a man the advance of a debt, asking him to give it back to me with a surplus”. So Abdallah Ibn Omar: “Such is the wear and tear”. The man resumed: “What are you ordering me to do”? Abdallah to answer: “The advance is of three aspects: one that you will advance desiring thereby, the Face of Allah, and you will have it; another of fact, where you will seek to please your companion, and you will receive his satisfaction; a third of accomplished, where you aim to obtain much more, and such is the wear”. The man again said, “What do you order me to do, O Abu Abdul Rahman”? The latter replied: “I conceive that you have to cancel the contract for the advance made; so if he gives it back for the same value you will have to accept it; if he gives it to you less than its value, and you accept it, you will have the reward; and if he gives you a much more valuable advance than yours, he will thus show his gratitude, which is moreover a form of thanks, as for you, you will still have a reward”.
(1388) 96 • Nafe' reported that he heard Abdallah Ibn Omar say: "He who makes a loan, should ask only to be reimbursed".
(1389) 97 - It was reported to Malek that Abdallah Ibn Mass'ud said: "Whoever makes a loan, should not ask that the collection be much better, even if it is a handful of food, it will be money. wear". - Malek said: "What is unquestionably followed among us (in Medina), concerning one who borrows a well-determined animal for any enjoyment, that it is tolerated, on condition of returning an animal similar, except for the case of female slaves, where there would be the risk of doing what is not lawful, which in fact will be unlawful, but this is not permitted. The interpretation of this repugnance is explained as follows: "Supposing that a man borrows a slave, that he cohabits as he pleases, then that he returns her to her possessor, which is neither tolerated, nor lawful. And well-versed men keep forbidding it without ever giving anyone permission to do so." Chapter XLV What Is Prohibited About Haggling and Bidding
(1390) 98 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Let none of you outbid another ".
(1391) 99 - Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Do not go and stand in front of caravans, let one of you does not sell to another, a commodity he has already sold, do not indulge in one-upmanship, do not let a city dweller sell for a Bedouin, do not let the milk accumulate in the breasts of female camels and ewes, because whoever has bought one of them will have the right, when milking them, either to keep it if he is satisfied with it, or to return it if he does not like it with a sa' of dates (in exchange for his milk). Interpreting this hadith, Malek said, "What is meant by this, and Allah is most knowledgeable about it, that one should not overbid in sales, that it is intolerable that a man outbids a commodity, while his co-religionist brother has already negotiated it, and the seller on his part has agreed with the buyer on the weight of the gold, and has guaranteed against any defect that may exist in the goods, noting thereby that the seller does not want to give his goods to the second buyer. This is what the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) has forbidden, and Allah is most aware of it. - Malek added: “There is no harm in haggling the price, where any final sale will be suspended, as long as everyone has the right to participate in the haggling. If people left the haggling and stopped at the price that the first buyer had already offered, the goods would have been sold at a low price and the sellers would be damaged. And this is what is always practiced in Medina”.
(1392) 100 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had forbidden that we supplant others”. - Malek interpreting this says: "The action of overbidding is that a man gives a commodity a price exceeding what is effectively its value at the moment when one no longer intends to buy it but only to induce another to buy it at that high price". Chapter XLVI On Sale in General
(1393) 101 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that a man had learned from the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) that he was deceived during the sale". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: “When you go to buy, tell the seller: “no deception”. And this man, making the purchase, was saying to the seller: “no deception”. ,
(1394) 102 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab say: "If you arrive in a country and find, let there be taken into account both the measure and the weight , make there, a long stay. On the other hand, if you find yourself in a country where weight and measure are neglected, hurry to leave this place”.
(1395) 103 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Muhammad Ibn Al-Munkader say: "Allah loves the servant who shows magnanimity in a sale, or a purchase, or a acquittal or claiming his right”. Malek said A - Concerning the man who buys camels, or sheep, or clothes, or slaves or any other goods, that we can count, this is not random. B-About the man who gives another a commodity to sell, when its owner had already made his assessment by saying to the other: "If you sell it for me at the price I have fixed, you will have a dinar” or something else on which they agreed and on which the two agree, and said if you do not sell it you will have nothing”. This is tolerated, if the sale price of the goods, and what the seller will receive, is a fixed salary. So if he sells, he will benefit, if not, he will have nothing”. C-It is similar to a man saying to another, "If you can find me my runaway slave, or my stray camel, you will have so much money", this is considered a fee paid, not a salary, because the salary in this case is no longer appropriate”. D As for the man to whom one gives a commodity, saying to him "Sell it, and you will have such an amount as a percentage of each dinar", this is not allowed because each dinar, reduced by the price of the commodity, will imply a diminution of the right of the other, and that is uncertain". 104 Malek reported that he asked Ibn Chehab about a man who rented a mount and then he in turn rented it at a higher price than the first rental? He replied, "There is nothing wrong with that." MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 32 The Book of the limited partnership "AI-Qirad" Chapter One Of what is said about the limited partnership 1396) 1 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that his father said: “Abdallah and Oubaidallah, the two sons of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, left with a troop towards Iraq. Once back, they passed by Abu Musa Al-Ach'ari, who was the governor in Basrah, who welcomed them cordially. Then he said to them, “If I could be of any use to you, I would have done so”. Then he continued: “I keep on me a certain amount of money forming part of the public treasury, which I intend to send to the prince of the believers. I deliver it to you, with which, you can buy goods from Iraq, which you will sell in Medina. Thus you will give to the prince of the believers the capital of the money, and you will have the benefit of it”. They replied, "We want to do that." He gave them the money, and sent in writing to Umar Ibn Al-Khattab, to receive the money from them. Once they arrived (in Medina) they sold the goods, and made a profit. They gave Umar the sum of money, he said to them: “Did he do the same with all the troops of the army as he did with you”? They replied, “No”. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab resumed: “As you two are the sons of the prince of the believers, he acted in this way with you. Give me the capital of money and its profit”. While Abdallah was silent, Oubaidallah said, “Why do you act this way, O prince of believers? If the money had diminished or was lost, we would be obliged to insure it.” Omar resumed: “Give it then”. Abdallah always kept silent Oubaidallah proposed to his father to reflect; immediately one of Omar's companions said: "O prince of the believers, and if you made this money, a capital of a limited partnership "Al-Qirad", to which Omar replied: "Yes I will do so" . Thus, Omar took the capital and half of the profit, and the other half was the share of his two sons Oubaidallah and Abdallah”.
(1397) 2 - Al-'Ala Ibn Abdul Rahman reported from his grandfather that Osman Ibn Affan had given him a sum of money in sponsorship, to be used in trade, on condition that the profit be shared between them". Chapter II What is permitted in the limited partnership
(1398) 3 Malek said: “Sponsorship is permitted when a limited partner gives a capital to a general partner in order to use it in trade, without the latter being required to insure it. Consequently what the general partner will spend during his trip, and for his food and for his clothes and in case the capital is portable and of sufficient value, will be taken from the capital. Thus, if the general partner is resident in his country, he will not be entitled to any capital expenditure, not even for his clothes”. - Malek said: “It is tolerated that sponsor and general partner suitably agree if there are no stipulations on either side. The limited partner can buy what he wants from the general partner, for merchandise, if the sale is made normally, without being subject to a condition. - Malek added: “He who advances to a man and a slave, a capital, in order to use it in trade, there is no harm in that, and it is permissible because the profit goes to the servant and not to his master, as long as he is taken for a general partner who is entitled to profit”. Chapter III What is prohibited in the limited partnership
(1399) 4 - Malek said: "If a man owes another a debt, about which he asks him to keep it in the form of a capital of a limited partnership "quirad", that does not is not permitted, except in the case where he has received his money, after which he may either consider it capital as a limited partnership or keep it. This must be done lest the debtor find himself in difficulty and delay payment for a certain period, wishing later to pay it off with a profit (and this will be usury). About a man who paid another a sum of money for a limited partnership"quirad", part of the money of which is lost before it bears fruit, and using the remaining part, he made a profit and the general partner asks the limited partner to consider the remaining part, as new capital before using it in trade- Malek said: "what is said is not accepted, and the general partner must pay the lost sum of its profit, then that it divides with the limited partner the remainder of the profit, according to the condition which they advanced”. Malek further said, “The capital of a limited partnership should be only silver or gold, and never any commodity or commercial transaction which gives rise to dispute between them. As for usury, it is absolutely forbidden, and it is never permissible to take it whatever its amount, because Allah the Blessed and the Most High has said (meaning): "If you repent , your capital will be preserved. Harm no one and you will not be harmed” Koran II, 279. Chapter IV Stipulations permitted in a limited partnership
(1400) 5 - Concerning the man who has paid to another a sum of money in the form of a limited partnership, subjecting him to the condition of buying himself with the sum which is proper to him only such and such merchandise or even that he prohibits him from buying a specific commodity", Malek said: "Whoever submits the general partner, on the condition, of buying with this sum of money, neither an animal, nor a commodity well determined, this is tolerated; on the other hand, it is not tolerated that the sponsor prevents the general partner from buying such or such merchandise, unless the latter is abundant, and that it is not difficult to find in winter and summer, so this will be tolerated . - "About a man, who pays another a limited sum, subjecting him to the condition, to share in a partial profit, independently of the total profit", Malek said: "this is not admitted, even if it is a profit of a single dirham, because the profit is to be shared equally, of which legally half must go to the sponsor unless the profit is fixed for him by a third or a quarter, or less or more than this ratio. Any profit whose proportion is fixed, is therefore lawful, therefore this is what is basically followed in a limited partnership between Muslims. And Malek added: “But if the limited partner advances as a condition, that the profit therefrom shall be one dirham or more, going to him alone independently of the part of the general partner, and that the rest of the profit therefrom shall be shared equally between them, this is not tolerated, and it is not an established foundation in the partnership between Muslims”. Chapter V What is prohibited as a condition in a limited partnership
(1401) 6 - Malek said: “It is not the right of the owner of the capital to appropriate a partial gain, by not giving a part to the general partner, nor that the latter cannot do that. In a limited partnership, neither the limited partner nor the general partner has the right to submit to each other any condition of sale or lease or of any work or advance or even a business without a mutual agreement. But this is permitted when both agree on this subject, without being subject to any condition, therefore it must be done for good, and it must be agreed for both partners. On the other hand, neither the principal, nor the general partner, has the right to subject the other to the condition, to have more than his partner, as far as gold is concerned, or to money, or food, or anything like that, in the sense that one will have more than his partner. And Malek explains: if the sum in sponsorship is affected by this or that aspect (cited above), it will turn out to be a wage earner that demands what is stable, what is determined. Nor is it permissible for him who receives the capital, to have it, having a reward, nor to entrust his merchandise to anyone, nor to entrust it to himself. If the money has increased in such a way that the capital is already reserved, the limited partner and the general partner must share between them, according to the condition on which both have agreed on the profit. But if the money has yielded no profit, or even the price of the goods sold has not recovered the capital, the general partner is entitled to nothing, namely neither of what he has done as expenses personal, nor of the loss suffered, and it is up to the sponsor alone to bear this loss. The limited partnership is permitted as long as the owner of the capital (limited partner) and the general partner have agreed on the sharing of the profit, namely whether it is equal, or fixed at one third or one quarter, or more or less than that. . - Malek said: “It is not allowed for the general partner to put forward the condition of benefiting from the capital for several years without being obliged to pay it. Nor is it permitted for the limited partner to ask the general partner to reimburse him the capital within a period that they both fix; for the limited sum must never be given for a term. However, the owner of the capital can give his money to the general partner in order to grow it for him; but in case one of them wants the contract terminated and the capital is still liquid, the owner of the capital can have his money back. On the other hand, that the owner of the capital wants to recover his money after a commodity has been bought with it, this is only permitted if the sale price and the capital are in cash. On the other hand, if the general partner wants to return the capital in the form of a commodity, before selling it, this is not allowed to him, because he must return the capital in the form of cash. Malek also said: it is not tolerated that the sponsor conditions the general partner to pay zakat with respect to his own share of the gain, because if the sponsor had done so, he would have had to seize a fixed sum of his own gain, by making himself exempt from the zakat that he actually had to pay on his own part. It is also not tolerated that the limited partner requires that the general partner only buys from such or such merchant, that he will designate. This is therefore not tolerated because the general partner becomes an employee who does not know his salary”. - Malek said again: "It is still not tolerated that the sponsor submits the general partner to the condition of making him a guarantee of the capital that he has paid him, because he will have thus asked for what is not agreed in the limited partnership and what is the practice of Muslims. However, if the capital has undergone an increase, its percentage of the gain would have increased further because of this guarantee. However, they must share the gain without any guarantee of either one or the other. And if this money is for any reason lost, the general partner will not assume any responsibility, because any condition in a limited partnership is considered null and void”. - Malek, finally, said: "If the sponsor pays the general partner a certain sum, requiring him to buy only palm trees or animals, with the aim that this sponsor wants the date palms and the evolution beasts, restraining them for some time, Malek said, "This is intolerable, and is also not what is practiced by Muslims in a limited partnership except, if he buys this commodity and then he resells it like any other commodity”. However, it is tolerated that the general partner asks the owner of the capital, a servant to help him in the operations of the company and not for any other purpose. Chapter VI The limited partnership when capital is merchandise
(1402) 7 - Malek said: "It is not tolerated, in a limited partnership, that the capital be other than money, thus excluding all merchandise, because if the capital is merchandise, it will have two aspects: or that he says to the general partner: "Take this merchandise and sell it, and from the sale price you will buy another merchandise, according to what is agreed in the limited partnership". Now, in this way, the sponsor would have earned a surplus by selling his merchandise, by having possessed enough, what he needs”; or even that he says to the general partner: "Sell this merchandise at a price, buy another then resell it, once the purchase and sale are perfectly accomplished, buy merchandise similar to that which I had, consequently this which is of a certain surplus will be shared equally between the two of us. And it is probable that the sponsor has given the general partner such flowing and expensive merchandise, following which the general partner will buy himself such merchandise, the price of which is less, so that this merchandise will be purchased at a third of the price previous, or even less, Thus, the general partner will have enjoyed a profit coming from half of the difference of the two prices, or that he will have bought the goods at a reduced price which, put on the market, will bring to the general partner a valuable profit, then he will wait for the price of this commodity to rise so that he can pay it, and will spend what he has received as a gain, thus making all his work vain. Such a sale is held to be random; however if this affair is unknown to the sponsor and the general partner, and that it has been accomplished until the end, the salary which is due to the general partner for having carried out, purchase and sale, and for his maintenance of the goods, will be considered, and we must pay him. As for the commodity, which has become cash, this is taken for new capital”. Chapter VII Transport costs in a limited partnership
(1403) 8 - "For a limited partner who had paid a sum to his partner to buy merchandise, and the latter transported it to a market, there was a risk that the merchandise would be lost, or even sold at a price less than the purchase price, so he went and transported it to another country, paying the transport costs. There, by selling the merchandise, at a price less than that of the purchase, the transport costs will have eaten up all the capital. In this regard, Malek said, “If the sale price is worth the sum of the transport costs, so it will be. But if the costs exceed by their value, that of the capital, the general partner will have to pay without the limited partner paying an additional sum, because he had already advanced a certain capital to the general partner in order to use it in trade. The general partner may not, whatever the condition, ask the limited partner for more than the capital he had paid, and if it is found that the latter owes something else, this will be held as a debt that he will have to pay, which is inappropriate. Chapter VIII The transgressed terms of the limited partnership
(1404) 9 - "About a sponsor who had paid his partner a sum, which used in trade brings him a profit, from which he bought a slave whom he had cohabited and as a result became pregnant, therefore the capital was diminishing”; Malek said: “If the general partner has money, the value of this slave is to be removed from the money in question, so that the sum of the capital which is missing, is rectified. If there is anything left over, it will be shared between them as agreed. If the general partner does not have the money to pay it, the slave is sold so that the capital is recovered from its price”. - About a man who gives a general partner a capital, and that the latter buys a commodity whose price exceeds by its value that of the capital, and therefore pays this difference in price himself. Malek on this subject says: “The owner of the capital will have to choose: if the commodity is sold at a profit or at a loss or even that it is not sold, he will be able to have it by paying its price or on the other hand, if he refuses it, the general partner will be his associate for this commodity in question according to his share of the price which he has already paid, whether this share be increased or decreased, taking into account the sum which was paid from his own money. - About a general partner who, receiving a capital from another, delivers it to a third person, without having had the license of the sponsor, Malek said: "The general partner must guarantee the capital, so that , if it decreases, it must recover this decrease, and in the event that it benefits, the limited partner will be partially entitled to this benefit, according to the condition advanced, and the rest will return to the general partner”. - About a general partner who had received a capital from a limited partner, from which he had bought a commodity of his own, Malek said: "If he has a profit, it will be shared according to the conditions of the limited partnership, and if he loses, the general partner will assume responsibility for that loss”. - In the event that a general partner asks the limited partner to advance him a sum other than the capital to buy merchandise for himself, the limited partner will have two choices: either that he be a partner in this merchandise with the general partner according to what is agreed upon in the limited partnership, or that he abandons it to him, returning to him all the sum he had paid him. Moreover, this is how we must act with regard to those who transgress the terms of a limited partnership”. Chapter IX Expenses Permitted in a Limited Partnership (14
(15) 10 Malek said, “When the sponsor pays a large sum of capital and the general partner travels the travel expenses are taken there, the general partner can procure his food and clothing as he sees fit, while as he can dispose of a certain sum for the miscellaneous expenses corresponding to certain works which are due to him such as: the claiming of debts, the transport of the goods and other similar works. Thus, he can use this money as long as it is necessary for him. However, the general partner does not have the right to deduct any sum from the capital as long as he is still at home, without being a traveller. If so, he will not be entitled to any additional expense for his clothes, because he will use up the money of the trade, in the place where he is resident”. On the other hand, Malek said: "If the general partner travels having on him the capital of the limited partnership and still his own money, his expenses are to be considered of the two sums and that in a way proportional to their amount" . Chapter X What Expenses Are Not Allowed in a Limited Partnership
(1406) 11 - “Malek said: “If the general partner travels with the capital of a limited partnership on him, he can spend what he needs as a sum and buy clothes. However, he is forbidden to make this capital a gift or an alms or a reward to someone. But if he is with people, who will bring food just as he himself will bring it for them to eat together, I believe, said Malek, that the general partner has the right to do so provided he does not seek to obtain food that is much more valued than that of others, and this without having had the permit of its sponsor. Because if he refuses, the general partner will have to pay him compensation, if this thing deserves to be done”. Chapter XI The Practice of Debt on the Capital of a Limited Partnership
(1407) 12 - Malek said: "What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), in the event that the general partner receives capital from the sponsor, thus buys goods and resells them eventually to a third person, profiting by there of a profit, then that this general partner dies before recovering the debt", Malek said: "If his heirs want to take care of this business, but on the condition of always having the profit which is the right of their father, they may do so, if they show fidelity; but if they refuse to take responsibility for the recovery of the debt, thus leaving the task to the sponsor, they may still do so, without their having any right to it. If they themselves intend to take charge of the recovery of the debt, they will be substituted for their father and will thereby enjoy the same rights of the contract and the expense. Just as they can instruct someone else they trust to claim the debt and collect it; consequently, the office being accomplished, they will be able to enjoy the same rights as their father”. Malek further said: “When a general partner sells the commodity forward, he will have to guarantee this debt”. Chapter Xn Merchandise in a Limited Partnership
(1408) 13 - "About a limited partner who pays a general partner a capital, and that both borrow money (sum independent of the capital) or that the limited partner asks his partner to sell for him merchandise that he owns, or also that he gives him dinars with which the general partner will buy for the sponsor a merchandise, Malek said: "The sponsor would not have charged his partner with a purchase and a sale, if he had not delivered capital to him, friendly asking him to do so and finding it easy to do, but if the general partner refuses to undertake it, the limited partner will not have the right to take back his capital of this partner, and the latter will not have to borrow from the other nor will agree to sell him goods, knowing full well that he does not have any capital; on the other hand, if the general partner refuses to undertake both the purchase and the sale, he is not obliged to return the capital of the limited partnership. However, if it is done, that both have agreed on what is suitable and for one and the other, without this being a condition, this is therefore permitted and tolerated. But if any condition appears in such a way that the general partner risks reimbursing the limited partner the capital in the event that he refuses what the limited partner instructs him to do, or that the limited partner fears that the general partner will not return his capital to him, this does not is more permissible in a limited partnership and it is what men versed in religion have forbidden to do”. Chapter XIII Advance made in a limited partnership
(1409) 14 - Concerning a man who gives another a sum of money on loan, and the latter asks that this sum be made a capital of a limited partnership, Malek said: "I disapprove of that, and he The debtor must first pay what he has borrowed, since the sponsor has the choice, either to return it to him as capital or to retain it”. - Malek also said: "If a limited partner gives capital to the general partner, and the latter then tells him that the money is on him, to leave it to him in the form of a loan, Malek, says this, is disapproved, as long as the limited partner has not yet taken over all of his capital, after which, if he wishes, he can either return it to the general partner or keep it for himself. This must be done, to avoid any risk that the money will be diminished and that the general partner only asks for this in order to delay the payment in order to be able to cover the deficit. Now, this is repugnant, not permitted and forbidden”. Chapter XIV Accounting in a Limited Partnership
(1410) 15 - "About a sponsor who, paid a capital to a general partner, in such a way that the latter, using him in trade, wanted to have his share of the gain, in the absence of the sponsor, Malek said, “The general partner is not permitted to have a share of the money while the limited partner is absent; in case he does, this must be guaranteed so that this sum will be part of the money, once it is shared”. - Also, Malek said: “It is not necessary that the two partners make the account and share, while the money is not at their disposal. Once the money is there, the sponsor will take part of his capital, then after he will share with the general partner the gain according to the condition accepted by one and the other”. - Malek said again: "Once a general partner has received a capital, with which he has bought a commodity, and has a debt to pay, let his creditors claim him, and they cross the general partner in a country where the limited partner does not remain, this done, the debtor general partner having in his possession good and beneficial merchandise to sell, the creditors will not have the right to impose on the general partner the sale of this merchandise in order to have their debt recovered from the profit of this sale, as long as the limited partner is not present to have his capital, after which the profit will be shared according to the condition accepted by him and the general partner. - Malek added: “Let a limited partner pay to a general partner a sum which, put into trade, brings to the latter a profit, thus causing the general partner to set aside the capital, and then to share the profit, in such a way to have his share, and to add that of the sponsor to his capital in the presence of witnesses. On this subject Malek said: “The profit should not be shared without the owner of the capital being present; if the general partner had already had any share, he must return it until the limited partner has recovered his capital, then the two will share, what remains, according to the condition accepted by them”. - Malek finally said: "In case a sponsor after having given a capital to the general partner which he has used in trade, let the latter come and say to the first: "This is your share of the profit, and I have had one like share, and also your capital is well reserved," Malek said, "I don't approve of this, until all the capital is fully available, so he will account to him until the capital in is within reach of the sponsor, knowing thus, that he has it in full and that he has even received it, after which they will divide the profit between them. The sponsor can return the capital to the general partner or he can keep it, but what is necessary is to have all the capital for fear that the general partner has reduced it, especially since he is willing that do not take it away from him, and let him keep it within his reach”. Chapter XV About the Limited Partnership
(1411) 16 - About a general partner who has bought with a capital received from a limited partner, a commodity, which the latter requires him to sell against what the general partner opposes, and who consequently brings them in In argument, Malek said, “You shouldn't listen to one without the other, it's better to ask experts for their views; thus if they judge that the goods should be sold, let it be so for both; if they think it is better to wait, let them wait”. - Malek said: "In the event that a general partner has put a capital on the market, which is delivered to him by a limited partner, and that the latter claims it from him, to which the other replies: "I have it in full" ; the limited partner insisting on having his capital, the general partner says to him: “I lost of this capital such sum, which he quotes, and I told you that I have it so that you still leave it with me", Malek finds that it is necessary to take into account the first answer of the general partner, namely where it is said that he owns all the capital, because it is useless for him to disown it afterwards, unless he does not advance compelling arguments justifying the cause of the loss; otherwise he must pay all the capital”. It is the same, continues Malek, if the general partner had made a profit of such a sum; and once the sponsor claims his capital and his gain, the other responds: “In fact, I didn't benefit from anything, and I only told you so that you would let me keep this capital; here again, it is not good for him to contradict himself if he does not put forward valid arguments justifying the cause of the loss”. - Malek also said: "In the event that a general partner, benefiting from a sum coming to him from a capital which is delivered to him by a sponsor, will go and say to the latter: "I have requested this sum to trade , on condition that I receive two-thirds of the profit", and the sponsor replies: "No, I paid you this money to trade on condition that you only have a third of it", it is necessary, says Malek, be for what is proposed by the general partner, and he will have to take an oath proving his presumption, namely that he wants to hear that such is the custom followed between the two partners and which moreover is practiced by people. Otherwise, neither his words nor his oath will be given importance, and he is responsible for returning the capital to the limited partner with the profit, according to what is usually practiced for a similar general partnership business”. - On the other hand, about a sponsor who gave a general partner one hundred dinars, with which he will buy a commodity. When paying the seller for the merchandise, he realizes that the hundred dinars have been stolen, the sponsor offers the general partner to sell this merchandise, and to take the price of what is sold plus the profit that would come out of it, and s If there is a loss, it will be up to the general partner to cover the lost money. However, to this the general partner replied: "Rather, it is up to the roof to pay the price of this merchandise that I bought with your money". Malek on this subject says: "In fact it is up to the general partner to pay the price to the seller, and the sponsor is asked: "or that you give the general partner the hundred dinars and that the goods be for you two, by therefore these new hundred dinars will be a new capital according to the terms of the first contract, or that you give up the goods. Thus, if he pays the hundred dinars to the general partner, this sum will be considered a new capital according to the conditions of the first contract, and if he refuses, the goods are the property of the general partner and it is up to him to pay his price. . - Malek said finally: “If there remains, after the payment of the capital and the division of the benefit, of the junk, that returns to the general partner. And I haven't heard otherwise. But if what remains is of the value of an animal, or a camel, or garments of coarse material, or the like, the general partner shall have to return them to the limited partner, unless the latter gives them to him. leave alone". MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Merciful The Merciful Book 33 The Watering Contract Book Chapter One About Watering
(1412) 1 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said, on the day of the conquest of Khaibar, to the Jews: "I will keep you in this territory as long as Allah, His power and glory, grant it to you, provided that the dates are divided between us". The reporter added: "And the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) sent Abdallah Ibn Rawaha, instructing him to be in Khaibar to estimate the quantity of dates , and he said to the Jews: "If you want to keep the dates, you can buy our share, if not, we will have them and we will give you half of them"; but the Jews preferred to have them”.
(1413) 2 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) sent to Khaibar Abdallah Ibn Rawaha, instructing him to estimate the gathering of dates and its sharing with the Jews. One day, continues the reporter, the Jews brought him their wives' jewels, saying: "This is for you, if you give us a discount and give us more than half". So Abdallah said to them, “O Jews! By Allah, you are the most hideous creatures to me. However, that will not cause me to be unfair to you, because it is only an illegal bribe that we will hardly eat”. They answered him, "Indeed, it is according to this righteousness that the earth and the heavens were established." - Malek said: “In case a man waters palm groves where part of it lies fallow, what he plants and harvests there will be for him”. Also, if the owner of the land wants any new plantation to belong to him, this is not accepted, because the man who has been entrusted with the watering will be in charge of an additional job, not being part of of the advanced condition”. ^ On the other hand, there is no harm in the harvest being shared if the expenses of sowing, watering and maintenance costs are borne by the partner. In the event that the partner stipulates to the owner of the land, the condition that the price of the seed be borne by the latter, this is not accepted, because in this way, the partner would have charged the owner with an expense considered as capital surplus. The watering and sowing contract obliges the partner to assume all the expenses without the owner of the land taking charge of anything. Besides, such is what is decent in a contract”. - If a source of water is the possession of two men, and its water dries up, and one of the two men wants to get its water, by doing some work there to recover this water, while the another refuses it, one will say to the first: “You have to dig so that you have all the quantity of water that you need to water your land. If your partner comes to claim his share of water, you will ask him for half of the payment that the work cost if he ever accepts, he will have his share of water, otherwise you will have the whole quantity. - If all costs and expenses are borne by the owner of the garden and the partner will only have his manual labor in this garden in respect of which he will have a share of the harvest, this is not tolerated because the partner's salary is not specified and he will not know whether he will have his full salary or not by correspondence at harvest”. - Neither the sponsor nor the person making a contract for watering and sowing is allowed to make an exception for a sum of money, nor for certain palm trees, without both of them agreeing to do so. approve because in this case, one would be considered an employee in relation to the other, namely that the owner of the capital will say to the other: "I conclude a contract with you on the condition that you take care of the palm trees, the waters and pollinizes them; and I will pay you another ten dinars if you work and this money will not be part of the capital”, Malek said: “It is not allowed and this is what is done here”. - What is a rule put into practice in the watering contract is to allow the owner of the garden to stipulate to his partner the insurance of works such as: firmly maintaining the walls, cleaning the water source , getting rid of stagnant water around palm trees, pollinating palm trees, cutting dry branches, picking dates, and doing other such work. However the partner will have in this case, half of the harvest or less according to what is dictated in this contract, or even more, if they agree on this point. On the other hand, the owner of the garden will not be able to impose other additional work on his partner such as digging a well, or raising water from a spring, or planting trees by paying their price, or build a rampart around a pool of water, in short, expensive work. This case is equivalent to that of an owner of a garden asking a person to build him a house in a certain place, or to drill him a well, or to dig him a source of water or other work, in exchange for which he will have half the quantity of the fruits in his garden, even before they are ripe and edible. It will be like a sale of fruits before they are in question, but this is what has been forbidden by the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam). - However, if the fruits are already ripe and they are for sale or consumption, it is tolerated for a man to say to another: "Do some work for me (cited above), specifying them, and you you will have half the quantity of the fruits of my garden", because thus, he would have entrusted him with a work with fixed wages, which he knew and accepted. As for the watering contract, in case the garden has no more fruit trees or even the fruits have diminished or are ravaged, under the effect of a plague, the partner will only have what is his right to harvest. A man can only be recruited for a well-defined job, because recruitment is considered the same as a sale, where one buys his work from the worker, and this is not tolerated, if he is done randomly, because the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) has forbidden the random sale", i - The rule followed in the watering contract, it is that it depends on fruit trees such as palms, vines, olives, pomegranates, plums and other such trees. This is tolerated on condition that the owner has half the quantity of the fruit, or a third or a quarter, or more or less”. - It is also allowed in the watering contract, as soon as a plantation grows and becomes robust that the owner is unable to water it, to work it, and to take care of it”. - However the watering contract is inadmissible, once the fruits or other kinds of harvest, become ripe, consumable and satisfactory for the sale, but it could, with the rigor be concluded for one year which follows. Thus in the previous case, as soon as the fruits become ripe, the owner can pay the other person a salary, in gold or silver, so that he cuts the date palms for him. Therefore the watering contract is permitted during the period of the cut, and the time when the fruits will be ripe and ready to be sold”. - Also the watering contract is tolerated, when it comes to the watering of trees whose fruits are not yet ripe and consumable and good for sale”. - On the other hand, it is not tolerated to conclude a watering contract for unsown or planted land; however, it is tolerated for its owner to return the soil, for a price paid in gold or silver or at another known price”. - Similarly, whether a man hands over his unsown or planted land to another to sow it against a third or a quarter of the crop which could be produced, this is considered random, for it may be that the planting yields as it may report nothing at all. Thus, the owner of the land will have neglected the location which could make his land fertile, preferring what is random, while not knowing whether this will take place or not; now this is repugnant, for the case of this proprietor is like that of a man who hires another for a certain journey, saying to him: "Do you want me to give you the tenth of the profit of my trade, as salary"? This is neither lawful nor tolerated”. - It is not tolerated for a man to engage in any work, or to rent his land or his ship, except for a well-specified sum”. - And, says Malek, it is to be distinguished between the contract of watering concluded for a ground planted with palm trees, and that which is it for an unplanted ground; thus the owner of the first will not be able to sell the fruits until they appear ripe; as for the other, he will be able to cultivate his land as long as it is not yet planted”. - The rule followed in Medina allows you to conclude a watering contract for three or four years, or even more or less for palm trees, for that matter, said Malek, that's what I heard about such contract concerning palm trees and any other fruit tree where the owner is permitted to conclude, for years, a watering contract”. - Concerning the owner of a garden, Malek said, that he is not allowed to take from his partner who gave him water, neither gold, nor money, nor food , nor anything else, because it is not tolerated. Likewise, it is not permissible for the partner giving the water, to take from his partner neither gold, nor silver, nor food, nor anything like that. As for what is surplus, for one and for the other, it is not allowed either”. - Similarly, says Malek, the sponsor is treated just like the one who gives water, if ever there is a surplus in the watering, or even if the sum sponsored turns out to be a salary, moreover, everything what will bring into play, a salary, is not tolerated, especially since this salary is considered random. And, we will not know if we will have the whole harvest, or more or less”. - Concerning the man, who makes a watering contract, for a man's land, where the palms and vines or other similar trees are, and that there is a part of the uncultivated land , Malek said, "If the unplanted part is auxiliary to that which is planted and which moreover constitutes the major part of the land, there is no harm in that, provided that the planted part of palms is two-thirds or more, and that which is not, either one-third or less. Thus if the non-cultivated part forms the two-thirds where the palm trees, vines or other similar trees are, it is tolerated that one pays a salary for watering without there being a contract which is prohibited. Because it is customary for people to conclude a watering contract when it comes to land where the planted part is major, while it contains an uncultivated part. It is permitted to rent the uncultivated land, against payment, even if it contains a planted part, just as one sells the Koran or the sword while each having a silver ornament, or the medallion or the ring encrusted with precious stones, sold for gold. And such sales are practiced by people, as well as purchases, without advancing, on this subject, precise criteria (inspired by the Koran or the sunna) stipulating that, when the main material constitutes half or less , this is prohibited; and if otherwise, such rental is permitted. The rule followed in Medina, which people from elsewhere do not stop practicing and indulging among themselves, is as follows: if the precious stone in question constitutes only the lower part of the object made of gold or silver , there is no harm in that, such as the case of the sword or the Koran or the ring, valued for more than two-thirds, and the adornment for the remaining third or even less”, Chapter II The condition laid down regarding slaves in the watering contract (1414) 3-Malek said: "The best I have heard about slaves hired, one who takes responsibility for watering according to the contract he concludes with the owner of the land is that they are taken on the same basis as a capital, from which their master will derive no profit. If he does not make them work, it falls to him to provide them with food, sometimes requiring excessive expense. They are considered just like watering from a flowing spring or from the water carried on the backs of camels. And you will not find a man making a watering contract for two plots bringing the same benefit, so that the first is watered with water from an inexhaustible spring, and the other with water. water that one draws and where for the first, one pays insignificant expenses to maintain the source, as for the other, that requires excessive expenses. Such is the rule followed in Medina. And by insistence, Malek says: "the inexhaustible source, is that which is not to be perforated, and whose water is always abundant". - It is not allowed for the owner of the land to entrust the employees with the performance of other work (other than watering) or to ask his partner to do so. Nor is it permissible for the person responsible for the watering to ask the owner of the land to have slaves work there when they were not working according to the contract”. - It is not allowed to the owner of the ground to ask that which is responsible for watering to draw aside one of the paid slaves, at the time of the contract. Thus, if he wants to dismiss it, he must do so before concluding the contract. Consequently, he is not allowed to enroll a new employee, only before concluding the “contract”. - If one of the slaves dies, is absent or falls ill, it is up to the owner to find another to replace him”. MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Merciful The Merciful Book 34 The Book of Land Leasing Chapter One About Land Leasing
(1415) 1 - Rafe' Ibn Khadij reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) had prohibited the renting of lands which are for cultivation”. Hanzala, reporting this hadith, says: “I had asked Rafé Ibn Khadij about the rental, if it is paid in gold or silver, he replied: “Either one or the other, there is no no harm”.
(1416) 2 - Ibn Shehab reported that he asked Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab about paying for the lease of the land; gold or silver? He replied, “There is nothing wrong with that”.
(1417) 3 - Ibn Chehab reported that he asked Salem Ibn Abdallah Ibn Umar about the lease of the land'? He replied, "There is no harm in whether it is done for gold or silver." Ibn Chehab added: "I said to him: what do you say concerning the hadith narrated by Rafé Ibn Khadij"? He replied, “Rafe' explained this hadith incorrectly. If I had land to cultivate, I would have rented it”.
(1418) 4 - It was reported to Malek that Abdul Rahman Ibn Awf had leased land; he kept it that way until his death. Her son said, “I thought we owned her because of long time she was with us, until my father mentioned it to us just when he died; thus, he ordered us to pay the rent he owed, in gold or silver”.
(1419) 5 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father rented his land for gold or silver”. Malek was asked about a man who has rented his farm, percent sa's of dates, or even for what it will produce of wheat, or some other crop. Malek pushed that back. MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Merciful The Merciful Book 35 The Book of Preemption Chapter One What is subject to preemption
(1420) 1 - Abu Salama Ibn Abdul Rahman Ibn Awf reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) commanded that preemption be applied in all that which has not been divided between the partners, but if the delimitation of the shares has already taken place, there is no longer any question of preemption”. Malek said, "Such is the sunna unquestionably followed."
(1421) 2 - Malek reported that Sa'id Ibn al Musaiab was asked about pre-emption, if there is a followed Sunna He replied: "Yes, certainly, pre-emption is to be applied in dwellings and land, and is specific only to partners".
(1422) 3 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab narrated the same hadith». Malek said: "If a man, in a country, buys a share of a property in association by paying with an animal, or a slave or other goods, and a partner comes to claim this share, according to the right of preemption, and finds that the slave is dead, without the two parties being able to specify its value, and that consequently, the buyer says: "The value of this slave is one hundred dinars", against which the partner having the right say, "Rather it is fifty," Malek said, "The buyer will swear, that the price of what he has bought is one hundred dinars, and then will ask, if he wants, whoever has the right to pre-emption, to leave what is bought or to take it, until the latter can provide clear proof that the price of the slave is lower than what is said by the buyer". - "The one who donates part of a house or land belonging to several partners to a third person who in exchange gives him money t or other merchandise, the partners can, if they want, take back this part by virtue of the pre-emption, and consequently pay this third person the value of the gift, either in dinars or in dirhams”. - One who donates his share in a house, or land belonging to several partners, without him changing it or claiming it, and his partner telling him that he wants to have it according to his own value, this is not permitted, as long as he has not changed it, but this done, this share will be given to the one who has the right to pre-emption, at its same value”. - About a man who bought a share in a land belonging to several partners, for a fixed price, and that one of the partners asks to take it back by right of first refusal", Malek said: "S' he is solvent, he has the right to pre-emption, but if he risks not being able to pay the price within the fixed period, he must present a solvent guarantor, that is permitted to him”. - Malek said: "The right of pre-emption of an absent man cannot be limited to a fixed date, although his absence is long-lasting, and this is what we follow at all times in Medina". - For a man, who gives his land to some of his sons, and one of them will have other children and then the father dies. If one of these last children wants to sell his share of this land, his brothers will have more than the paternal uncles, partners of this land with the father, the right to pre-emption. And such is the rule followed in Medina”. - Malek said again: - The right of pre-emption between the partners is proportional to the value of their shares: each of them will be entitled to his share whether it is little or a lot, even if they seek to make reduce some compared to others. So if one of the partners buys the share of the other, and another partner says: I buy a share equivalent to mine, by right of first refusal, then the buying partner says: "If you want, I let you have, by right of first refusal, all the shares, or you can leave them to me. This being advanced by the buyer, the partner must either have all the shares, or else leave them. If he buys them, it's his right, otherwise he has no right to anything. - Concerning the man who buys land, has it planted or even digs a well there, and then there comes a man who claims by the right of pre-emption, this land, and wants to have it, but he does not will not have, until he has paid the other, the value of the expenses of the work; if this value is paid, he will have the land by right of pre-emption, otherwise he will have no right”. - The one who sells his share in a land or a house belonging to partners, and once the partner having the right of preemption, has been made aware, and the buyer wanting to resolve the purchase contract and the first agrees, Malek said, "He has no right to do so, and whoever has the right of first refusal can take it back at the same price that was paid". - Whoever buys a share in land, or a dwelling or animals or other goods, in a single transaction, and the partner having the right of pre-emption claims his share in everything, the buyer to answer him: "You have to buy everything at once because I have already bought everything", Malek said: "Rather the partner must buy his share of the house or the land, thereby valuing this share independently of the other things sold , thus taking into account the price that has been paid. Then the partner will have his share of what has been estimated, once the price has been paid, without having any rights with regard to the other goods or the animals, unless he wants it”. - When a man sells his share in a land which belongs to several partners, also delivering some shares of the partners to the seller, as for others, refusing this, insist on having, according to the right of preemption, their own shares; thus, these partners who have refused, can, and always according to the right of preemption, have all the shares, without them being satisfied with the proportion of their share, and consequently abandoning what remains”. About the plurality of partners having one dwelling, if one of them sells his share while his partners were all absent, except for one, who, so to speak, or offered him to to have, by right of preemption, this part or to leave it, and that he answers: "I will have my part, and I leave the others to my partners until they are present. Thus, if they will take their shares, it will be such, if not, I will take, by right of preemption, all the shares”, Malek said: “He can only either have the whole, or leave it; thus, if his partners present themselves, they can claim it from him, or leave it to him. However, if ever this is offered to him, and he refuses it, I, continues Malek, think that he no longer has the right to withdraw. Chapter II What is not subject to the right of pre-emption
(1423) 4 - Abu Bakr Ibn Hazm reported that Osman Ibn Affan said: “If the delimitation of the land is already made, it is no longer subject to the right of preemption; no right of first refusal with regard to a well or a male palm tree”. Malek, on this subject, said: “Such is the rule followed in Medina”. * Malek said: * One does not appeal to preemption for a road fit to be divided or not; the same applies to a common forecourt between several dwellings, divisible or not”. * About a man who buys a piece of land owned by several partners, in such a way that he is given a choice. If the seller's partners want to have what he has sold, and refer to the right of pre-emption before the buyer has to choose, they cannot allow themselves this right as long as the purchase and sale have not been definitely completed; thus, if the sale is made, they will act according to the right of pre-emption”. * Concerning the man who buys land keeping it for a certain time, in his possession; then came another telling him that he has the right to inherit this land; Malek said: “He will have the right to pre-emption, if he proves to have the right. As for the harvesting of the land, it must revert to the first buyer, until the other has proved his right, because the first buyer had already guaranteed the planting, if ever it had been ravaged. or uprooted by a torrent". But if a long period had elapsed, or the witnesses were found dead, or the seller or the buyer was dead, or they were alive, but the sale price and purchase for lack of time, the right to pre-emption is broken and everyone will have their right. If the case were to be considered otherwise, depending on whether the time is sooner or later, and it is realized that the seller had secretly kept the real price with the aim of depriving the other of the right to pre-emption, we will make the valuation of the land, for a new price in relation to the first, then one will consider what has been added to this land, of construction or planting or other works, thus the man having the right of preemption , will buy the land, paying the price for the total”. Malek added: “The right of pre-emption is to be considered in the property of the dead as well as in that of the living. Thus, if the relatives of the deceased fear the loss of his property, they can share it and sell it, consequently, the right of pre-emption is no longer to be considered”. - However, continues Malek, one never considers the right of pre-emption concerning a slave, female or male, neither of a camel, a cow, a sheep or other animal, or of 'a garment or well in uncultivated land; on the other hand, the right of preemption is considered in what is to be shared, and what is delimited in a land; and if it is the contrary, this does not call for the right of pre-emption”. Eventually Malek said, “Whoever buys land where people have a right of pre-emption, and they are present, they have to take this matter to the sultan; thus, either they deserve it by their right of pre-emption, or that the sultan delivers their part to the buyer. If he leaves them without referring to the sultan when they are aware of this purchase, if they leave for a long time after which, they claim their right, I think they will have no more right to do it) MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Merciful The Merciful Book 36 The Book of Sentences Chapter One The exhortation to judge fairly
(1424) 1 - Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “I am a human being. When you report your accusations to me, one of you may skillfully present his case to me, to such an extent that I agree with him on something of his brother's good. So let him not take it, because indeed, I only give him a piece of Hell”.
(1425) 2 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab reported that a Muslim and a Jew, quarreling with each other, brought their accusation to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab. Finding that the Jew was right, Omar judged in his favour. So the Jew cried out, “By Allah, you have judged with justice,” Umar gave him a whiplash, saying, “How do you know that?” The Jew replied, "We find that no judge gives his judgment in justice, except he has an angel on his right hand and one on his left, who set him on the straight path, granting him success for righteousness as long as it is for justice. But, if he leaves justice, they abandon him and return to heaven». Chapter II About Testimonies
(1426) 3 - Zaid Ibn Khaled Al-Jouhani reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Did I not tell you , who is the best martyr? He is the one who presents his testimony before he is asked, or he who declares his testimony before he is asked”.
(1427) 4 - Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdul-Rahman reported that a man from Iraq came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab and said to him: "I come to see you for a question that has no beginning or nor end”; Umar answered him, “What is this question”? The man replied: “The false testimonies that are present in our country”. Omar asked him: "Is it really so"? - Yes, answered the man. So Umar exclaimed, “By Allah! No man is detained in a country of Islam without the testimony of righteous men”. j (...) 5 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "The testimony of an adversary and an accused, is not admitted". Chapter III The Testimony of One Who Has Suffered a Prescribed Punishment - It was reported to Malek that Sulaiman Ibn Yassar and others were asked about a man, who having suffered a penalty of flogging, can one accept his testimony? They replied, "Yes if he showed repentance." (...) 6 - Malek reported that by asking the same question to Ibn Chehab, he answered the same to Soulaiman Ibn Yassar». Malek said: "And such is the rule followed in Medina, and it is from the words of Allah Blessed and Most High (meaning): "Strike with eighty lashes those who accuse honest women without being able to appoint four witnesses; and never accept their testimony again; these are the ones who are perverse except those who, as a result of this, repent and reform. Truly Allah is the Forgiver, He is Merciful” (Koran XXIV, 4,5). Malek further said, “Thus, what is indisputable in Medina is that whoever, has suffered a punishment of flogging, and after he repents and reforms, his testimony will be admitted. And that's the best I've heard about it." Chapter IV The Subject of Judgment Based on the Oath of a Witness
(1428) 7 Ja'far Ibn Muhammad reported from his father that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's favor and peace) judged according to the oath of plaintiff and a witness".
(1429) 8 Abu Zinad reported that Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz gave the order in writing to Abdul Hamid Ibn Abdul Rahman Ibn Zaid Ibn Al-Khattab, when the latter was the governor of Kufa: "Judge according to the oath of the plaintiff and a witness".
(1430) 9 It was reported to Malek that Abu Salama Ibn Abdul Rahman and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar were questioned whether one could judge by the plaintiff's oath and, a witness”? They replied, "Yes." * Malek said: The precedent in the sunna prescribes that one judges by the plaintiff's oath and the testimony of one man, so if the plaintiff makes an oath with his witness, he is confirmed in his right. Thus, if the plaintiff renounces the oath and refuses it, the accused is asked to do so, if the latter takes the oath, he is deemed innocent, and if he refuses to do so, this proves the plaintiff completely right.” . * However this Sunnah is followed for all that is private property; which is not the case for everything concerning the demarcation (of a land), nor marriage, nor divorce, nor postage, nor theft, nor defamation. Thus, if one wants to say: "The postage is part of the goods, one will be wrong, because if it is thus, the slave and his witness this one being present would have made an oath, that his master the freed. On the other hand if the slave had had a witness presented, who attests that he is the owner of the money, and that they both make an oath, he will have his full right, just like the case of a man free". '* Thus it is Sunnah followed in Medina, in case a slave presents a witness, who attests that he has been freed, to cause the master of that slave to swear that he has not freed him if this is done, what the slave claimed to be is no longer considered”. * It is the same for the sunna followed concerning the divorce, so if the woman presents a witness, attesting thanks to him, that her husband divorced her, her husband will be made to swear that he has not. divorced; if he does, she will not be divorced”. * Malek continued and said, "There is one Sunnah, regarding divorce and deliverance, supported by the testimony of one man; the oath will be taken by the husband of the woman, and by the master of the slave, as long as freedom is one of the prescribed laws and the testimony of the woman is not tolerated on this subject, because if the slave is freed, his person will be upright, and will therefore be subject to the same penalties prescribed, just like a free man; if he commits adultery, while he is married, he will be stoned; if he kills, he will be killed; he finally has the right to inherit his successors. one protests by saying: "If ever a man has freed his slave, and another comes to claim from the master of this slave a debt which the latter owes him, in such a way that he has as witnesses, that he owes him a debt, a man and two women. In case the slave possesses no property, and the man insists on having his debt, the master will be brought to ten ir this debt in charge in order to pay it, and consequently postage will no longer be considered. This man who came to claim his debt, sought to bear the testimony of the women, a tolerated testimony about the emancipation; yet their testimony takes into account only the question of the debt. The case of this man is like that which, freeing his slave, a man comes, supported by a witness, swearing to claim a debt which this slave owes him. If this debt is found to be due, postage will no longer be considered. Or even that a man who, having a financial dispute with the master of a slave, comes to claim that he has a debt that the master of the slave must pay him, one will say to this master: "Swear that you don't owe him what he claims to have in your house”; if he renounces and refuses to swear, the plaintiff will be asked to take this oath, which, consequently, by doing so, proves that he is entitled to this debt from the master of the slave. This means that the freeing of the slave is no longer considered, if it is proven that the master owes a debt to the man in question”. - It is the same for the case of a man who marries a slave; having become his wife, her master comes to say to the man: “You bought my slave for so many dinars”; the husband denying this, the master of the slave calls upon a man and two women to testify and justify his words. Thus the sale is maintained, the master will have his right, the female slave will be illicit for her husband, and will separate from him. The testimony of women, in the case of a divorce, is not admitted”. - Another example: That a man accuses a free man of slander, so that he ends up being subjected to the prescribed penalty. He calls a man and two women testifying and certifying his words that the accused man is a slave. Thus, the man who has woven the slander, flees the prescribed punishment. The testimony of women is no longer admitted concerning slander”. - What is still similar to this case, where the difference between the judges is underlined and which is of the sunna followed, is when two women testify that a child is born alive, and as a result, he has right to inheritance, and will subsequently bequeath his property to his successors. If the boy dies, and the women who have been witnesses, are found unaccompanied by a man, and having not sworn an oath, and let the inheritance be a great fortune consisting of gold, silver, residences, gardens, slaves or other property, therefore the two women who had already testified, of one dirham or more or even less their testimony is not to be considered, if they are not not supported, by a man witness and an oath to be made". - There are some among the people who say, that an oath made by a single man witness, is not considered, justifying their protest, relying on what is said by Allah Blessed and Most High ( meaning): “Ask for the testimony of two witnesses from among your men. If you cannot find two men, choose a man and two women, among those whom you accept as witnesses” (Koran II, 282). Malek said: "if a man and two women are not called to testify the complaining man will not be entitled to anything and therefore he should not be asked to take an oath with his witness, the man plaintiff will not be entitled to anything and therefore he should not be asked to take an oath with his witness". It is the argument of the one who said this hadith, to say to him: "What do you think of a man who claims to have a debt from another, will not the latter be asked to swear that 'He owes nothing, so the claim of the other will be denied; If he renounces to swear, the plaintiff will be asked to take this oath, and then his right will be asserted. Moreover, this is not disputed by anyone, nor in any country. However, which verse of the Book of Allah did he refer to? If he wants to affirm this, let him appoint his witness who will take the oath, even if it has not been mentioned in the Book of Allah. And, it is enough to follow the tradition that was adopted by our ancestors. But the man wants to know what is right and what is argued. And, this is an explanation of what can trouble the mind, Allah willing”. Chapter V The judgment concerning the man who dies and leaves a debt to be repaid and another debt owed to him and having only one witness thereto (1431) - Malek said: "When a man dies, and that he is owed a debt, and that he has only one witness thereto, and furthermore that he owes the people a debt, having yet there only one witness, then that his heirs refuse to swear, with their witness, not to owe such a debt, the creditors are asked to swear to recover what they owe. In this case, if any part of the estate remains, the heirs will have no right to it because they have been called upon to take an oath and have refused it, except that they say: "In our opinion, our deceased n 'left nothing as an inheritance', and we realize that they refused to take an oath because of this. So, in my opinion, they must take such an oath and take the rest after the debt is paid”. Chapter VI The Judgment Concerning a Trial
(1432) 10 - Malek reported that Jamil Ibn Abdul Rahman Al-Muezzin shared with Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz the sessions, where he decided controversies between people. In case a man came to claim to have a right from another, Omar took the matter into consideration; thus, if he found that between them, there was a common affair or conjecture, he asked the accused to make an oath, and if he found that there was nothing like it, he did not not take an oath. Malek said: "That is what we follow at home (in Medina) that in case one man brings an accusation against another, it should be considered that way, if there is a matter between them common or conjectural, the accused is asked to take an oath; if he does so, the accusation is no longer considered, on the other hand if he refuses to do so, deferring the oath to the plaintiff, and that the latter takes the oath, he will thus have his full right”. Chapter VII Judgment made on the testimony of children
(1433) 11 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that Abdallah Ibn Al-Zouhair took into consideration the testimony of the children, for the common wounds between them”. Malek said: “What is followed (with us) in Medina is that the testimony of children is tolerated between them, for injuries that are common to them, without this being tolerated for others. Thus, their testimony is tolerated, for having had only between them, wounds, and that before they separate, or that they are deceived or that they are taught. Thus, if they separated, their testimony is no longer considered, except in the case where they declared, before separating, what they had witnessed, to righteous people”. Chapter VIII The violation of the oath before the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam)
(1434) 12 - Jaber Ibn Abdallah Al-Ansari reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever, before my chair will do a false oath will have its place in the fire”.
(1435) 13 - Abu Ummah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "He who, taking a false oath, succeeds in s seize the property of a Muslim, Allah will forbid him to enter Paradise, and will integrate him into Hell". He was asked, “Even if it is something insignificant, O Messenger of Allah”? He replied: "Even if it is a simple branch of arak", repeating this for three times". Note: the arak, a kind of shrub, whose branches are used to make siwaks, which are used to brush one's teeth”. Chapter IX The oath taken before the minbar (the pulpit)
(1436) 14 - Abu Ghatafan Ibn Tarif Al-Mouri reported: 'Zaid Ibn Thabet Al-Ansari and Ibn Muti' had argued over a house, they brought their accusation to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam, who was , at that time, the governor of Medina. Marwan asked Zaid Ibn Tabet to take an oath before the pulpit, so Zaid replied, "I will take an oath, from my place." Marwan replied, “No, by Allah! You will only do it before the bench of the judges”. Zaid, never ceased to make oaths, thereby affirming that his right is just, and refusing to do so in front of the pulpit, which astonished Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam”. Malek said, "I don't envisage anyone taking an oath from the pulpit, if the subject is less than a quarter of a dinar equivalent to three dirhams." Chapter X What is not tolerated in the withdrawal of the deposit
(1437) 15 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r Upon him the grace and peace of Allah said: "It is not permissible to prevent withdrawal. pledge". - Interpreting this, Malek said: "I think, and Allah is best informed, that a man who has pledged to another, something of greater value than what he has borrowed, and that the pawnbroker says to the lessor: "I will return your right to you on such a date, otherwise, you will have what I have already pledged". Now, continues Malek: “This is neither permitted nor lawful; moreover, this is what was prohibited even if the borrower pays after the due date, what he owed, because he will always have the right to withdraw his pledge and what has been stipulated is at to cancel". Chapter XI Judgment made in the pledge of fruits and animals (1438) Yahia reported that he heard Malek say about one who pledges a garden for a fixed time, that he will not have to do , fruit picked from this garden, before the deadline date, an integral part of the pledge, unless the lessor so requests. Likewise, if a man pawns a slave who is pregnant or will be pregnant after the date of the pledge, her newborn remains with her”. - Malek said: “We made the distinction between the fruits, and the newborn of a slave. On this subject, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) said: "Whoever sells palm trees already fertilized, the fruits belong to the seller, unless the 'buyer asks to have them'. The rule, says Malek, unquestionably followed among us (in Medina), about whoever sells a slave, or a female of animals being pregnant, the new-born reverts to the buyer whether or not he asks for to have, however the palm trees are not considered animals, neither are the fruits like the fetus in the bosom of its mother”. Malek interprets this as follows: “People usually pawn the fruits of palm trees and not the palm trees themselves, but no one pawns a fetus while in the lap of its mother, whether it be that of a slave or a female of the animals”. Chapter XII The Judgment Concerning Pledge with Animals (1439) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "What is unquestionably followed among us (in Medina), regarding pledge is this: 'If this which is pledged, is land or a dwelling or an animal, which may be ravaged or destroyed or die, while being in the hands of a lessor, this responsibility falls to the borrower on pledge without however the right of the lessor is not diminished. Thus, any pledge disappearing while being in the possession of the lessor and which can only be assessed according to the latter's statements, its compensation is the responsibility of the lessor who must pay it and who will be told "Describe it, and make an oath". Considering what is said, expert people will estimate the value; thus if the value of the pledge is higher than that which was previously fixed, the borrower will be able to keep the difference, but if the value is lower, the borrower will be asked to take an oath suitable for the affirmation of the statements of the lessor without him being responsible for the compensation, held for the difference between the pledge and the object given in substitution. If the borrower refuses to take the oath, the lessor will be given the difference. If the lessor, in turn, is unaware of the value of the pledge, the borrower will be asked to take an oath in which he will give the description of the pledge, recovering the difference himself if he provides obvious proof”. Malek said: "This is done, as long as the lessor keeps the pledge in his possession, without having given it to another". Chapter XII Judgment made for a pledge existing between two men (1440) Yahia reported that he heard Malek say about a pledge, which, being between two men, one of them then wants to sell it , as for the other, he had granted him for the question of this pledge, the period of one year?. Malek said: “If the pledge can be divided, without the share of the one who granted the delay being diminished, half of the pledge will be sold to secure his right. And if one risks his share being diminished, one will sell the entire pledge and give the damaged party its due. If the one who had granted the delay wants to give his half to the borrower for good, let it be done, otherwise the lessor will be asked to make an oath proving that the other had granted him a delay, only for to be able to keep the pledge as it is, and in this case we will immediately give him his right”. About the slave whose master pawns him, while the slave owns property, Malek said, "These property does not form part of the pledge unless the lessor requires it." Chapter XIV The Judgment Concerning Pledges in General (1441) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "Concerning one who pledges personal things, which were destroyed at the lessor, but let the debtor confess this that he owes by giving the description of these things and without denying the other his right. They are in agreement except for the value of the pledge so the dispute will hold on the value, where the borrower says that it is twenty dinars, and that the lessor says that it is ten dinars, whereas the loan is twenty dinars?. Malek said, “Whoever is in possession of the pledge will be told; “Make his description”; if he does, he will be asked to take an oath, and therefore experts will be called in to assess the pledge in question. If the value proves to be higher than that of the real value of the pledge, the lessor will be asked to pay the borrower the difference of what he is entitled to. If the value is lower, the lessor will recover the difference from the borrower. If, in the end, the value is the same, the pledge will be compensated”. - On the other hand, in the event that two men are arguing over the issue of a pledge, so that the borrower says to the lessor: "I have advanced this as a pledge, for ten dinars" and the lessor replies: "It's more like twenty dinars", emphasizing that the pledge is in the possession of the lessor, Malek said: "We will ask the lessor to make an oath where he will specify the value of the pledge so if he proves that it is as such without anything more or less, the lessor will take back the pledge against this value. And there, or will ask him first to make an oath because the pledge is always his property, unless the borrower does not pay the value, in order to want to take back his pledge. - If in the above situation, the value of the pledge turns out to be less than twenty dinars, the lessor will be asked to make an oath thus ensuring the sum he has set, and the borrower will be asked : "you will pay the sum fixed by the lessor, by making an oath and you will take back your pledge, or, you will make an oath, where you seek to ensure the fixing of the sum which you have declared, and consequently you will dispense with the difference designated by the lessor. If the borrower makes such an oath, nothing is due to him, otherwise he will pay the amount that the lessor had already fixed”. - If the pledge has disappeared, and the pledgee and the borrower both deny the right; if the one who has the right says: “I accepted this pledge by paying twenty dinars”, and the debtor answers him: “you only had ten dinars”; then the lessor, who has the right replies: "The value of the pledge is only ten dinars", to which the borrower replies: "It was worth twenty dinars", the one who has the right will be asked, describe the pledge; so if he does, he will be made to take an oath, and then relying on this description, expert people will in turn estimate the value. If it proves superior to that which has been estimated by the pledger, he will be asked to make an oath, and consequently the borrower will be given the excess of the value of the pledge. If the value is lower, the pledgee will be asked to make an oath, thereby ensuring his right (of twenty dinars), and he will seek to compensate for the value, the debtor will then be asked to make an oath thereby ensuring, that the rest must go to the defendant, once the value of the pledge is taken into consideration. Because, the one who has the pledge in his possession, will become in relation to the borrower, a plaintiff, who making an oath, he will owe nothing of what the lessor had sworn about the excess of the value of the pledge. But, in case he refuses, he will have to pay the right of the lessor which is related to this excess”. Chapter XV The Judgment Concerning the Hiring of Beasts if the latter cause Harm (1442) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "When a man hires a mount to go to a definite place, then crosses this place to another, the owner of the mount will have to choose: "either that he claims the rental of his mount for the distance which has been covered in addition and will therefore have to collect with it the first rental by taking back his mount, or that he claims the price of his mount (in proportion to the distance covered in addition) and the first rental if this rental was made for the outward journey. If the rental includes outward and return, and then the renter exceeds the midpoint he had previously designated, the owner of the mount would be entitled to half (of the excess) of the first rental, since this rental covers two journeys: outward and return. The tenant having exceeded the designated place, will only have to pay half of this rental. If it is done that his mount is dead when he arrives in the designated country, the tenant will have no guarantee with regard to the owner and will only pay him the rental provided for his half”. Such is the rule followed when there is a dispute between the owner of a mount and its tenant, about the mount rented by the latter”. On the other hand, it is the same for the one who takes from the owner of a capital, a limited sum, in such a way that the latter says to him: "Do not buy yourself with this sum either an animal, or a commodity. », which he quotes to him, and that he forbids it, repugnant that his sponsorship sum is paid for such a purchase. Now, if this man who had taken the money, went to buy himself, which the owner of the capital forbade him to do; wishing thereby to guarantee the money, and deprive the owner, of the profit, if, therefore, this is done, the owner will have to choose: "or to share with the other the profit of the goods according to the condition advanced by them at this subject, by entrusting him with the money or even to have his capital back being guaranteed by the other, and of what, moreover, he had abused it". It is the same for the case of a man who asks another to buy him a commodity which will be to join with his own by paying him a sum, so that he buys himself a commodity that he designates for him. . In the event that the other buys a commodity which is not that which has been designated for him, by abusing this trust, the owner of the sum will have to choose: "either that he takes the commodity which the other bought it for him, or that he takes back his money once the second guarantees it to him". Chapter XVI The judgment concerning the woman raped by force
(1443) 16 - Ibn Chehab reported that Abdul Malek Ibn Marwan ruled that the man who raped a woman by force, should pay her the dowry”. - Malek said: “Concerning the man who rapes a woman by force, whether she is a virgin or married, he will have to pay her her dowry if she is free, and a sum equivalent to her price, which has become devaluative, if she is a slave. As for the prescribed penalty, it is to be applied to the violator alone, independently of the one who was violated who is not responsible for it. On the other hand, if the violator is a slave, it is his master who will be responsible for it, unless he agrees to hand him over”. Chapter XVII Of The Judgment regarding the use of an animal and the consumption of food and the like (....) - I heard, Yahia reported, Malek say, "What is followed among us (in Medina ), concerning the one who has consumed an animal without having had the permission of its owner, it is that he will have to pay to the latter, the estimated price of this animal on the day, even on which he consumed it, without that he gives in compensation for this animal, another which is similar to him. The sum, in this regard, is considered the fairest compensation, whether it is an animal or a commodity. - Malek also said: "As for the one who has consumed a food without having had the permission of its owner, he must in compensation give back to this owner the same food and of the same weight or measure, for the good reason that the food is considered the same as gold and silver, where silver is compensated by silver and gold by gold. On the other hand, the animal is not taken in the same way as gold; and in this respect it is by the sunnah that the distinction has been made”. - Malek finally said: "If a man deposits with another a sum of money, with which the second will go to trade and acquired a profit, this profit belongs to him alone, as long as he has made guaranteed money until he returns it to its owner". Chapter XVIII On the Judgment Made Regarding the Apostate
(1444) 17 - Zaid Ibn Aslam reported that the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever changes his religion, strike his neck" . Interpreting this hadith, Malek said: "What we think, and Allah is most knowledgeable, about whoever changes his religion, one should kill whoever denies Islam and converts to another religion such as atheists and their fellows, and who declare it, they are killed, because it is not known whether they have repented, but if they keep their atheism in disbelief, and declare to be Muslims, they must neither be allowed to repent nor accept their words . On the other hand, the one who leaves Islam, to adopt another religion, while declaring it, we will accept for this one his repentance, if he puts it in proof, otherwise we kill him. Because, for people who find themselves in such a situation, I think that we must convert them to Islam and that they repent. So if they show repentance, we will accept it, if not, we will kill them. And said Malek, I do not believe that the Prophet (upon him the grace and peace of Allah) meant by that, the Jews who became Christians or the Christians who became Jews, nor those who left their religion for another, except that it is about Islam, because the one who leaves it to adopt another religion while declaring it, such is the man whom the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) wanted to designate and Allah on this subject is the most informed.
(1445) 18 - Abdul Kari reported that a man came from Abu Musa Al-Ach'ari, to find Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, who questioned him about people, to which the man replied . Then Omar said to him, "Have you heard from those who are in the distant regions"? The man replied, "Certainly, a man has apostatized after being a Muslim." Omar resumed: "What have you done with him"? The man responds: “We brought him in and cut off his head”; Omar exclaimed: "Did you not put him in prison for three days, giving him a piece of bread to eat every day, in order to give him the possibility of returning to Allah, repenting and converting again to Islam”? Then Umar added: “Great Allah! I was not present at this murder, and I would not have ordered it, nor accepted it, if I had been informed of this event”. Chapter XIX Judgment Made About One Who Finds His Wife With A Man
(1446) 19 - Abu Houraira reported that Sa'd Ibn Oubada, finding the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: "What do you think , if I find a man with my wife; should I leave it so that I can call four witnesses”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: “yes”.
(1447) 20 - Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab reported that a man from Syria, named Ibn Khaibari, having found with his wife, a man, killed him, or killed them together. Reporting this case to Mouawia Ibn Abi Soufian, so that he can judge on it; Mouawia falling into the embarrassment, wrote to Abou Moussa al-Ach'ari, asking him to have the opinion of Ali Ibn Abi taleb, on this subject. Ali -replied, “This event did not take place in my country; I ask you to tell it to me; Abou Moussa wrote to Mouawia Ibn Abi Soufian, following which Ali gave his proposal saying: “I, the undersigned; me Abou Al Hassan if he does not call four witnesses, that he must pay the price of the blood of the victim”. Chapter XX The Foundling Judgment
(1448) 21 - Ibn Chehab reported that Sunain Ibn Jamila, a man from Bani Sulaim, found, in the time of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, an abandoned child. Sounain continues: “So I took him to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab who asked me: “What made you take charge of this little soul”? Sounain answered: "I found it, neglected, so I took care of it". One of Omar's advisers said to him: “O prince of believers, he is a virtuous man”, Omar on his part replied: “Do you find him as such”? Yes, replied the adviser; thus Omar Ibn Al Khattab declared: "Leave then, he is free, and you have the right to patronize him, as for us, we will take care of his expenses". Malek said: "What is followed in Medina is to consider the abandoned child, free, and the Muslims to patronize him, while inheriting him and paying for him, the price of blood". Chapter XXI The judgment concerning the adoption of the child to his father
(1449) 22 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported: “Utba Ibn Abi Waqas had entrusted to his brother Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqas, a child, saying to him: "The son of the slave of Zam'a is mine, take care of him". Aicha continues: "When it was the year of the conquest, Sa'd took the child saying: 'He is the son of my brother (nephew) and it was his father who entrusted him to me.' Abd Ibn Zam'a protested and said, "He is rather my brother, and the son of my father's slave, born on his bed." Bringing their accusation to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) Sa'd said: “O Messenger of Allah, he is the son of my brother, who entrusted him to me", and Abd Ibn Zam'a, on his part, said: "He is my brother, and is the son of my father's slave, born on his bed"; the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "He is your brother to you, Abd Ibn Zam'a", then added: "The child returns to the master of the bed, adultery, on the other hand, must be stoned”. Finally addressing Sawda Bint Zam'a, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "You have to veil yourself, in his presence", seeing the resemblance of the child in question to Utba Ibn Abi Waqas. And this child never saw Sawda, until his death”. ;
(1450) 23 - Abdallah Ibn Abi Oumaya reported that a woman, having lost her husband, passed a widowhood of four months and ten days, then this period having passed, she married a man with whom she remained for four and a half months, and gave birth to a child after a pregnancy of nine months. Her husband went to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab to whom he told this; Omar then summoned elderly women, who had witnessed such a situation in pre-Islamic times, and asked them to inform him about it. One of them said, “I can tell you about this woman; her husband died while she was pregnant, then she had a discharge of blood, but her child remained stable in her bosom. As soon as her second husband has had intercourse with her, the child, having tasted the sperm, is revived and grows bigger”. Omar considering what was put forward by this woman, separated between the woman subject discussed and her husband, saying: "I have been told about you (addressing the group of women) only good things, then attached the child to the first husband”.
(1451) 24 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab linked children born in pre-Islamic times to those who claimed to be their fathers in early Islamic times. Two men came, each claiming in turn to be the father of a son born to a woman. So Omar Ibn Al-Khattab summoned a physiognomist who was going to examine them both then said: “This child is both at the same time” Omar, gave him a whiplash then summoned the woman saying to him: “Tell me the truth” . So the woman said: "One of these two men - and she pointed to one - was going to my house, when I was at that time tending the camels to pasture, he did not part with me unless he was sure and me too, that I had become pregnant. Leaving her, she had a flow of blood, after which the second man had cohabited her, thus, she does not know of this fact which of the two is the father”, the physiognomist, listening, exalted Allah, as for Omar , addressing the child, said to him: “It is up to you to choose, which of the two will be your boss”.
(1452) 25 - It was reported to Malek, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab or Osman Ibn Affan, had judged the case of a slave, who invited a man to adultery, telling him that she was free, he married her and bore her several children: "Let a man ransom his children with what is equivalent". Malek in this regard, said: "And to ransom them at the value of their price is more just, in this case, Allah willing". Chapter XXII The judgment relating to the subject of the inheritance of the recognized child (1453) -Malek said: - What we follow at home (in Medina), is what follows: “when a man dies, and that one of his numerous sons, says: "My father has recognized such, to be his son"; this relationship is never taken into consideration, based on the testimony of a single person. On the other hand, whoever makes such a recognition, will have to give from his share received from the paternal inheritance, a share similar to that which he recognized to be son of his father”. • Interpreting this, Malek said, “Let us consider that a man dies leaving two sons, and a sum of six hundred dinars, where each will have three hundred dinars for his share. One of them, testifying that his father had declared to him, before his death, that so and so is his son, he will have to give on his part, one hundred dinars to the son in question. Such a sum constitutes half of the recognized child's share; on the other hand, if the other brother had given the same testimony, the child should still have one hundred dinars, thus receiving his full share of the inheritance, and consequently his parentage would be evident (let us emphasize that, the inheritance being thus shared, each will have had his fair share, namely two hundred dinars). Her case is similar to that of a woman who confesses that her father or husband owes a debt, and the other heirs deny it; thus, she will have to discharge this debt to the creditor, in proportion to what she will receive as part of the inheritance, if it is done that the debt will revert to all the heirs: for example, if she inherits the eighth of the inheritance as a wife, she must pay one-eighth of the debt to the creditor; and if she inherits half as an only child, she will pay half the debt. This is the standard that should be applied to women acknowledging debt”. If, again, a man confesses to the woman in the same way that his father owed some debt, the creditor is inclined to make an oath with his witness, and will thereby have the entire debt. However, this case is not taken in the same way as that of the woman, as long as the testimony of the man is tolerated; thus the latter having recognized the debt, the creditor is asked to make an oath with his witness, and will therefore have all his rights. If the creditor fails to make this oath, he will have of the inheritance of him who acknowledged the debt to him, a part which is proportional to the part due to the successor of the inheritance; as for the others, they would have denied this debt”. Chapter XXIII The Judgment Made Regarding Mother-Slaves of Children
(1454) 26 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported from his father that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “What happens to men, who after having cohabited with their slaves, they leave them? Every slave who came to tell me that her master had cohabited her, I would only attribute the child to her master, whether or not he had practiced coitus interruptus with her.
(1455) 27 - Safia Bint Abi Oubaid reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “For what reason men cohabit their slaves and then leave them. Any slave who came to entrust me, that his master had relations with a slave, I would make him adopt the child. So either you have to give them up or keep them”. - Malek said: "About the slave-mother of a child, in case she commits a crime, it is the rule followed among us (in Medina), that her master pays the price within the limits of its value without it delivering it. And, consequently, he will not have to burden himself with any value other than that which his price merits. Chapter XXIV The Judgment Made About Uncultivated Land Belonging to No One
(1456) 28 - Urwa reported from his father that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Whoever revives a dead earth, it will be his property. On the other hand, whoever appropriates land unjustly, by planting it, this land will never be his possession”. - Interpreting this hadith, Malek said: "by unequal appropriation is meant any land that has been either cultivated or planted, without any right".
(1457) 29 - Abdullah reported that his father Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said, "He who revives a dead land, it will be his possession." Malek said, "This is what was followed at home (in Medina)." Chapter XXV The Judgment Made About Water
(1458) 30 - It was reported to Abdullah Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "About of the irrigation canals of "Mahzouz and Mouzaineb" two valleys in Medina: "He who owns the upper part of these two valleys, retains the water at the level of his land (thus watering his land) then when it reaches the level of the ankles he sends her back to water the lower part». 1459). because in this way we will prevent the grasses, serving as pasture, from growing”.
(1460) 32 - Amra Bint Abdul Rahman reported that the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "One should not forbid the abundance of water from a well. Chapter XXVI Judgment made for a service of common interest
(1461) 33 - Amr Ibn Yahia Al-Mazini reported from his father that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "One does not must neither harm anyone nor respond to damage by another".
(1462) 34 - Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Let none of you forbid his neighbor to plant a beam in the wall of his residence”, then Abou Houraira added: “Why, I see, that you turn away from accepting it; by Allah, I will throw this beam between your shoulders.
(1463) 35 - Al-Mazini reported from his father that Al-Dahaq Ibn Khalifa had dug from "Al-Ouraid" - valley in Medina - an irrigation channel, which he wanted to cross in a land that belonged to Muhammad Ibn Maslama. The latter refusing it, Al-Dahaq said to him: “Why do you refuse it to me, and yet you are going to take advantage of it? you will be able to have water to drink forever, and it will not harm you”. Muhammad still refusing it, al-Dahaq informed Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, who summoned Muhammad Ibn Maslama, and ordered him to allow it to Al-Dahaq. But Muhammad still not accepting, Omar exclaimed: "Why do you prevent your brother from doing what is useful to him, and which is still useful for you: you will water your land forever with this water , and that will not harm you in any way”. Muhammad's answer being: "No, by Allah", Omar exclaimed: "By Allah, he will make this channel pass, even on your belly", and then ordered Al-Dahaq to dig it, the latter made".
(1464) 36 - Yahia Al-Mazini reported that his father said: “There was in his grandfather's garden, a rivulet which belonged to Abdul-Rahman Ibn Awf. As Abdul Rahman wanted to divert the course of this rivulet towards a place close to his land, the owner (who is the grandfather) forbade him; so Abdul Rahman having made Omar Ibn Al-Khattab learn this, he gave him the right to do it”. Chapter XXVII Judgment Made Regarding the Distribution of Property
(1465) 37 Thawr Ibn Zaid Al-Dili said: "It was reported to me that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: 'N' any abode or land that was shared in pre-Islamic times will be maintained as it was shared. And any abode or land that is to be shared in Islamic times, will be shared according to Islamic law”.
(1466) 38 - Malek said: "He who dies, leaving property, being in 'Al-Alia' and 'Al-Safila' (places in Medina), the unirrigated territory will not be shared with the one who it is irrigated, with water brought to it; unless the heirs of the deceased accept it. Non-irrigated land is to be shared with another with water from a spring, if both are alike. In case the property is in one place, or close to each other, each party will be considered alone, and then the successors will be divided. The same goes for houses and homes. ” Chapter XXVIII The Judgment on Carnivorous Beasts and Guarded Herds
(1467) 39 - Haram Ibn Sa'd Ibn Muhaiissa reported that a camel possessed by al-Bara Ibn Azeb entered a garden and caused damage. The Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) requires that the owners of the garden keep it during the day; as for the damage caused by the camel during the night, it is up to its owner to compensate for it”.
(1468) 40 • Yahia Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Hateb reported that some of his slaves stole a camel from a man from Mouzaina and slit her throat. The case was presented to Omar, who ordered Kathir Ibn Al-Salt to cut off their hands. But immediately Omar grabbed hold of him and said to Hateb: “Don't you give them enough to eat? By Allah, continued Omar, I will make you pay an unbearable fine”, then addressing the man: “What is the price of your camel”? Al-Muzani replied, "By Allah, I will not sell it for less than four hundred dirhams." So Umar said to Hateb, "Give him eight hundred dirhams." - Malek said: “It should not be believed, that one sought in Medina, to double the value; but that's what people usually followed; now, however, the value of the fine is equal to that of the price of the camel or the animal on the day it was taken”. Chapter XXIX The Judgment Made About One Who Causes Harm to Beasts (1469) - Malek said, "What is followed with us (in Medina), in case anyone has caused harm to a beast, c is that he will pay a price, compensate for the one that was going to be subtracted from the real price of the beast which has thus lost its value”. - In the event that a camel throws itself on a man in such a way that he is frightened, killed or mutilated, Malek said: "If this man was fully sure of the danger, it is not for him to pay anything as compensation ; on the other hand, if your only argument is what he says, he must indemnify the owner of this camel”. Chapter XXX The Labor Wage Judgment (1470) – Malek said, “Whoever gives his garment to the washerman to change his color, after which he comes and says to the latter: I did not command you to do so , and that the other answers him: in fact, it is you who ordered me to do it”, one must in this case, one must admit what is the words of the washerman, and it is the same, when it comes to a dressmaker and a jeweler where they are apt to take an oath about it unless they were going to do other than what they were asked to do; thus, they will no longer be able to be believed and the one who possesses the garment will be asked to make an oath. If he refuses to do so, the dyer is asked to do so. - Malek also said: "If the dyer, to whom the garment has been given, is mistaken in knowing that he is giving it to another man who is not its possessor and that he puts it on, one does not does not require anything from this man but it is up to the dyer to pay an indemnity to the prossesseur of the garment, given that the one who put the garment was unaware that it was not his; on the other hand, if he knew that this garment was not his, he must guarantee it”. ChapterXXXI The judgment made about the guarantor and the one who takes charge of a debt (1471) - Malek said: “In case a man having a debt, makes it take charge of another who is creditor to him; if the latter goes bankrupt or dies without having paid the debt, nothing is demanded of the debtor and the creditor has no right to go back on him to recover his debt. Such is the indisputable rule followed with us in Medina. - Malek also said: "When a man assumes a debt that he will pay for another and he dies or goes bankrupt, the creditor has the right to come back to the debtor to settle his debt". Chapter X XXII The judgment made concerning one who buys a garment having a defect (1472) - Malek said: "Whoever buys a garment having a defect such as a burn or the like, which the seller knows and has confirmed, and that the person who bought it tore it, in such a way that this tearing reduced the price of the garment, after which the buyer noticed the original defect, the garment can be returned to the seller, without provided that the buyer has nothing to pay for having torn this garment". - Malek also said: "If a man buys a garment with a defect such as a burn or a hole, that he seeks to cut or dye, and the seller says that he did not know that the garment was like this, the buyer may choose between doing or keeping the garment after the seller has agreed to reduce its price because of the defect, or else returning the garment to the seller by paying him compensation for the cutting or dyeing. However, if the buyer has had the garment dyed in such a way that it has become more expensive, he will still have to choose: either to ask the seller for a price compensating for the defect in the garment, or to be a partner in the seller for the question of the garment. Then, the garment including the burn or the hole is appraised; thus if the price is ten dirhams, and the dyeing of the garment is five, the seller and the buyer are both partners of the garment, where each will have a share which will be proportional either to the initial price of the garment, or to the costs paid for dyeing”. Chapter XXXIII What Is Not Permissible in Giving Presents
(1473) 41 - Al-Nou'man Ibn Bashir reported that his father brought him to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) to whom he said: "I gave my son the gift of a slave that I owned". The Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered: “Have you made the same gift for all your sons”? No, replied the other, so the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said, "So take back this slave."
(1474) 42 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported that her father Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq had given her a gift of twenty wasqs of dates, being from her property in “Al-Ghaba”. When he died, he said: "By Allah, my daughter, I would not like to see anyone richer after me than you, and it is unbearable for me that you are poorer than the others, so I I donated twenty wasqs of dates, which if you had picked them personally, they would be a donation to you; but now, being considered an inheritance, you will have to share them with your two brothers and sisters, according to what is prescribed in the Book of Allah”. Aisha asked him, “Father, if it were so, by Allah, I would have abandoned him. However, I only have Asma for a sister, who is the other one? He replied: "It is the daughter that Bint Kharija (the wife of the brother of Abu Bakr of the Ansars) carries in his bosom, and I consider her as such (he implies that this daughter will be the sister of Aicha ).
(1475) 43 - Abdul Rahman Ibn abdul Qari reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said, “What happens to men giving gifts to their sons and then retaining those gifts with them. Thus, if one of them has a son who dies, he says: “My goods are always within my reach, I have not given them to anyone”. But as soon as he feels death approaching he says: "This is a gift I gave to my son". "Now, whoever decides to make a donation, and does not advance it to the person to whom he intended it, preferring to keep it as an inheritance to his successors, this donation becomes illicit". Chapter XXXIV Of what is forbidden as a gift (1476) - Malek said: "What we follow at home, (in Medina), about the one who gives a gift to someone, not aiming to have another in exchange, doing it also in the presence of witnesses, that this gift is already assured to the intended person, except in the case where the one who made the gift dies, before he has actually given it to the other. On the other hand, if the donor wants to retain his gift, after he has made a testimony about it, this is forbidden to him; thus, if the one to whom the gift belongs claims it, he must have it”. - Malek also said: "Whoever gives a certain gift, after which he disowns it, then whoever was to benefit from this gift, brings a witness, assuring him that the other had indeed given him a gift, namely that this either a commodity, gold, silver or an animal, one will bring the one who was to benefit and his witness to make an oath on this subject. If they refuse it, the giver will be asked to do so, if the latter still refuses it, he will give to the other what he claims, by right, to have, especially if he has only one witness; if the latter is not present, the donor will have nothing to advance”. - Malek finally said: “Whoever makes a gift, without wanting to have something in return, and the beneficiary dies, the heirs of the latter, will benefit from this gift; and if the beneficiary dies before having had his gift, he will have nothing in this case, because the gift was not yet in his possession. Thus, if the donor wants to keep it, having had a witness about his donation, proving that he had made it, the beneficiary will be able to have it, if he asks for it”. Chapter XXXV Judgment Made Regarding Gifts
(1477) 44 - Abu Ghatfan Ibn Tarif Al Mourri reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “Whoever gives a gift, or even an alms, to a close relative, should no longer withhold it. And whoever makes a gift, wanting thereby to obtain another in exchange, can keep his gift, even go back on this gift, if he is not satisfied with what he should have in exchange”. - Malek said: "What is followed with us (in Medina) about the receipt of a gift, which undergoes a transformation of more or less, that the recipient wishing to make an exchange, will have to consider the value of this gift just at its delivery”. Chapter XXXVI Taking Alms Back (1478) - Malek said, "What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), when a person who has given his son an alms which he has already taken, or who has remained in the custody of the father, and whoever testifies about this alms, the father will no longer have the right to withhold this alms, either partially or totally”. - Malek said again: "Whoever makes a gift which is not alms to his son, has the right to withhold this gift as long as the son has not used this gift to take a debt from the people of so that he becomes a debtor; thus, in this case there the father will not be able to retain this gift to leave his son unable to discharge his debt. Consequently, the father does not have the right to withhold his gift in the following cases: That the father gives his son, or his daughter in marriage, in such a way that the girl does not marry the man or that the man only marries the girl to be rich and for the money his father had given him. Or even that the man marries the woman to whom his father had given him, thus assuring him a large dowry due to his wealth and his goods, and to what his father had given him”. Chapter XXXVII The judgment made about the "Umrah" NB The "Umrah": it is about the fact that someone says to another: "I will give you this dwelling where you can stay, as long as you are alive" . On the death of the person who disposes of this residence, the residence must return to its owner if he is still alive; otherwise the heirs of the one who lived in the house will be able to benefit from it”.
(1479) 45 Jaber Ibn Abdallah Al-Ansari reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam)r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: "Everyone, receiving what is the “Oumra”, as well as its heirs, will be its possession, without ever returning to the donor”; also this property will be subject to the laws of inheritance”.
(1480) 46 - Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Kassem reported that he heard Makhoul Al-Dimashki asking Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad about the "Umrah", and what people say about it"? Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad replied, "People never cease to bind themselves to their time-honored promises, about their possessions and what they receive." - Malek said: "What we, follow at home (in Medina), concerning the Umrah, is that it must return to its owner at the death of the donee unless he said to the latter: "It belongs to you and your heirs”.
(1481) 47 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar had inherited Hafsa Bint Omar, his abode. However, the latter, had lodged in this residence, the daughter of Zaid Ibn Al-Khattab, as long as she was alive; but when she died, the residence returned to Abdallah Ibn Omar, which he considered to be his”. Chapter XXXVffl Judgment about what is found
(1482) 48 - Zaid Ibn Khaled Al-Jouhani narrated that a man came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) asking him about what is found". He answered him: “Study well, the form of the object found, then make an announcement about it for one year; if its owner comes to claim it, it will be his right, if not, it will come back to you”. The man asked again, "O Messenger of Allah (Upon him be Allah's mercy and peace), what do you say about the lost sheep?" He answered: "It will be either yours or your brother's or the wolf"; the other added, "What about the stray camel?" The Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) replied: “Do not worry about him; for the camel has its water to drink, and its hooves (to move about); it will therefore be able to drink, eat the leaves of the trees to eat, until its owner finds it”.
(1483) 49 Mu'awia Ibn Abdallah Ibn Badr Al-Jouhani reported that his father told him, that on his way to Shâm (Syria), he stopped at people's houses and he found a purse containing eighty dinars. Telling it to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, he said to him: “Announce; this find in mosques, and to anyone who arrives from Châm (Damascus), for a year; if this time has already elapsed, it will come back to you”.
(1484) 50 - Nafe' reported that a man having found a lost object, went to Abdallah Ibn Omar and said to him: "What do you say about a lost object that I found"? Abdallah Ibn Omar said to him: "Announce this object". Answering him that he had already done it, Abdallah asked him to do it again; So then, after having announced it several times, Abdallah said to him: “I will not order you to consume it; because if you wanted to, you would not have taken this object”. Chapter XXXIX The judgment made about the consumption of a slave for a found object (1485) Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina), concerning the slave, who, finds an object, consumes it, before a year has elapsed from the very day on which he had found this object, that he will assume the responsibility for it, namely: "Or that the master of this slave will pay to the owner of this object, a compensating price by there, what his slave had consumed, or that he will deliver his slave to him”. But if the slave had kept the object found for the period provided for, namely, one year, after which he consumed it, this object will be for him a debt which the slave will have to discharge; consequently if he happens to be freed, nothing will be demanded either of him or of his master concerning this object”. Chapter XL The Judgment Made About Stray Animals
(1486) 51 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that Thabet Ibn Al-Dahhaq Al-Ansari told him that he found a stray camel at "Al-Harra", he restrained it and then reported this to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab who ordered to announce about the camel, three times. Now Thabet said to him: "This camel made me neglect my properties", Omar said to him: "Leave it where you found it".
(1487) 52 - Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaisab reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, while having his back leaning against the wall of the Ka'ba, said: "He who guards a stray animal, has already committed a sin ".
(1488) 53 - Malek reported that he heard Ibn Chehab say: "Stray animals were, in the time of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, considered as belonging to their owner, and therefore they copulated that no one thinks of holding them back. But, when it was time for Osman Ibn Affan, he ordered to advertise about them and then sell them; thus, if their owner presented himself, he was paid their selling price”. Chapter XLI Alms given from the living for the dead
(1489) 54 - The grandfather of Sa'id Ibn Amr Ibn Churhabil Ibn Sa'id Ibn Sa'd Ibn Ubada reported: "Sa'd Ibn Ubada, went with the Messenger of Allah r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) for an expedition, and his mother was about to die in Medina, he was told: "Make your will". She replied, “Why make this will; all the property I own goes to Sa'd”; then she died, before Sa'd was present in Medina, he was told what had happened, Sa'd said to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him be grace and peace of Allah): “O Messenger of Allah, will she be rewarded if I give alms in her name”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) replied: “Yes, certainly”. Then Sa'd said: "Such a garden, (which he pointed to), is alms."
(1490) 55 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) reported that a man came and said to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah): “O Messenger of Allah my mother died suddenly, and I believe she wanted to tell me to give alms for her; can I do it”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered him: “Yes, certainly”.
(1491) 56 - It was reported to Malek that a man of the Ansars, from the tribe of Al-Hareth Ibn Al-Khazraj, gave alms to his parents. His parents having died, the son inherited all their property which was palm groves. So he asked about this the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who replied: "You gave alms to your parents, and you have already had a reward; as for the inheritance, it is your acquisition”. MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Merciful The Merciful Book 37 The Book of the Testament Chapter One The order to make a will
(1492) 1 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: “It is required of every Muslim, who, possesses assets to bequeath, not even to spend two nights without having written down one's will". - Malek said: "What is followed among us (in Medina), concerning the one who, being healthy or sick, and who has already made his will in which he freed a slave or ordered something else, that he may, if he so wishes, modify what is in the will, until his death. He can even neglect this will and proceed to write another, except the posthumous freeing of a slave, because there, he will not be able to change anything. This is in accordance with what the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "It is the duty of every Muslim, who, possesses property to bequeath , not even to spend two nights, without having written down his will”. - Malek continues: "Thus, if it is done that the testator can no longer either have his will modified, nor change its contents concerning the postage, he will have withheld his money which he tended to spend for the postage and for other action. The testator must make his will when he is traveling and when he is healthy”. Eventually Malek said, "Thus, what is an indisputable rule is that the testator can therefore change his will as long as he wishes, without this change affecting the subject of posthumous emancipation". Chapter II Permission for the younger, the sick, the weak and the foolish to make their will
(1493) 2 - Abu Bakr Ibn Hazm reported from his father that Amr Ibn Soulaim Al-Zouraqui told him that Omar Ibn Al-Khatiab was told about a young man who did not not yet reached puberty, from the Ghassan tribe, possessor of a fortune whose only heiress in Medina was a paternal cousin, as for the other heirs, they are in Cham (in Syria). Umar Ibn Al-Khattab replied, "Let him make a will to his cousin." The young man, thus, bequeathed him a piece of land called: "Bir Joucham" which was sold for thirty thousand dirhams. This cousin who received this bequest was Oum Amr Ibn Sulaim al-Zouraqi”.
(1494) 3 - Abu Bakr Ibn Hazm reported that a young boy from the Ghassan tribe, was dying, while he was in Medina, and his heir was in Cham. We informed Omar Ibn Al-Khattab of this, and we asked him if this young man could make his will, he replied in the affirmative. Abou Bakr added: "The young boy in question was ten or twelve years old, and had made a bequest of land called "Bir Joucham", later sold by the heir for thirty thousand dirhams". - Malek said: "What is followed among us (in Medina), concerning the one who has a weakness of spirit, and the one who is foolish, and also, the one who loses the conscience sometimes, that their will is to consider, if they prove to be, if need be, reasonable. However, if they fail to be so, that is, they fail in reason, they cannot make their will”. Chapter III The bequest which does not exceed one third of the inheritance
(1495) 4 - Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqs narrated: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) having come to visit me, during the pilgrimage of the farewell, when I was seriously ill, I said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, the disease attacked me from all sides; but I have a good fortune and I have only one heiress daughter, can I give alms from two-thirds of my wealth”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the favor and peace of Allah) replied: “No”; So I asked him: "and half"? “No, replied the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), but the third, and even the third is already too much; That you leave your heirs rich is better than leaving them poor, holding out their hands to people. For all your expenses on your family by seeking the love of Allah, you are rewarded, even for the mouthful that you will have put in the mouth of your wife”. I said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, will I remain in Mecca, while my companions are no longer there”? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa sallam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: "You will not be a laggard in vain, for every good deed you do will raise you in degree and in consideration. You may be retarded, but on the one hand you will be useful to some and a detriment to others. O Great Allah! Make my companions complete their emigration and do not turn them back. But the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) was saddened, a little later, that the unfortunate Sa'd Ibn Khawla died in Mecca”. - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: "when a man bequeaths a third of his property to another, saying: 'my slave will serve such a man as long as he is alive', after which he will be freed, and that following the death of the testator, it is noticed that the value of the slave constitutes a third of his goods, one must, in this case, make esteem for the service rendered by the slave, and so , the two men will have their share, just as follows: one gives to the first what is proportional to the third of the goods, and to the other what returns to him from the service of the slave after evaluation; therefore, each of them will have his share of the value of the slave's service or of his wages if he has done the work of his wage-earner, in proportion to what he is entitled to. But if the man in whose service the slave had worked dies, he must be freed”. - Malek also said: "He who bequeaths a third of his inheritance, saying: "One share to such, another to such", citing his property, and his heirs find that the legacy is more than a third" , these heirs will have to choose: or that they give to the designated characters their part of the goods which return to them, by having with them all the heritage of the deceased; or that they give to the designated persons a third of the property of the deceased, and will subsequently have their shares, of whatever value they may be”. Chapter IV The bequests given by a pregnant woman, a sick man and a man fighting in the way of Allah (1496) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "The best I have heard about the will made by a pregnant woman, and concerning her property, what is allowed to her is that she is considered just like a sick person, who in case her illness is not serious, namely that she is not is not tragic, he will be able to dispose of his property as he wishes; on the other hand, if the illness is tragic, the patient will only be able to bequeath a third of his inheritance”. And, continues Malek, such is the case of a pregnant woman: her pregnancy is a welcome and a joy, where she is neither sick nor risky, which is also said by Allah (Blessed and Most High) { وامرأته قآئمة فضحكت فبشرناها بإسحق ومن وراء إسحق يعقوب } "We gave her good tidings of good news (of Isaac, and Yacoub, after Isaac" (Koran XI, 71): { إليها فلما تغشاها حملت حملا خفيفا فمرت به فلما أثقلت دعوا لئن ربهما لئن لنكونن من الشاكونن من الشاكرين } "She wore a light burden with which she walked without difficulty. When she staggered, both invoked Allah, their Lord: if you give us a fair, we will surely be grateful. (Koran VII, 189) Thus, once the pregnancy of the woman is in the sixth month, the woman will be able to dispose of a third of her property; for it is the completion of the six months; where Allah Blessed and Most High said: { وَالْوَالِدَ ات يرضعن أولادهن حولين كاملين } "Mothers who want to give their children a breastfeeding, will breastfeed them two whole years" (Quran II, 33), and: { وفصاله ثلاثون شهرا حتى إذا بلغ أشده } "Since the moment it has conceived, until the time of his sevarge, thirty months have elapsed” (Koran XLVI, 15). Thus, if, from the day the woman became pregnant, six months have passed, she will only be able to dispose of a third of her property”. - Malek finally said: "The man who participates in a fight, he will be able to bequeath, that the third of his goods, thus, he is considered, under the same conditions, as a pregnant woman, and a seriously ill man. Chapter V The Legacy of a Reservitor, and the Right of Possession (1497) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say about this verse: { إن ترك خيرا الوصية للوالدين والأقربين بالمعروف حقا على المتقين } "If the if (the deceased) leaves property, he must make a will in favor of his father and mother" (Koran, II, 180), which has been abrogated by other verses relating to the distribution of the inheritance according to which is prescribed in the Glorified Book of Allah. - Malek also said: “It is indisputably followed Sunna with us (in Medina), not to tolerate making a bequest to an heir, unless the heirs give this right to the deceased. In the event that some of the heirs allow it and others refuse it, the heir to whom it is decided to make a bequest will receive this exceptional share of the first part, while the others will have their full share”. - About the patient who can only dispose of a third of his property, his heirs are asked for the permit to make a bequest to an heir, exceeding the third, Malek said: "Once this permit is granted, the heirs will no longer have the right to return to it, because, if this were allowed to them, any heir at the death of the testator, would have acted in the same way, namely, that he will have the inheritance without putting the legacy into execution, including the third party and what the testator had bequeathed according to the permit granted to him”. As for the testator, who in good health, asks his heirs for permission to make a bequest, and that the latter grant it to him, Malek said: "They are not bound to accept it, and these heirs even have the right to refuse it, because, the man in question, being in good health, he has more than anyone else the right to enjoy his goods, namely to make alms at all, or to give them to anyone . On the other hand, if the man falls ill, thus no longer being able to dispose of his property, the heirs' permit becomes payable as long as he can only dispose of a third of his property, as for them, they will only have two third of which they have more right than him. Consequently, if one of the heirs comes to ask the dying man to give him the inheritance, and the latter accepts it without putting it into execution, this gift must go to the one who must benefit from it, except if the man leaving the inheritance does not say: “Such of the heirs is weak, and I like that you give him your share and that he accepts it, that is tolerated if the sick man had quoted the thing precisely”. - Malek again said: "If he gives him the inheritance, and the beneficiary has executed a part, while another remains, this part must return to the donor after the death of the heir". - Finally Malek said: "About the one who, in his will, cites having given to one of his heirs, something which he had not otherwise obtained, and therefore these heirs refuse to give him tolerate, this legacy must return to them, according to what is prescribed in the Book of Allah, because the deceased did not want this legacy to be part of his third party. And we never give to legatees what is a third of their inheritance”. Chapter VI The subject of effeminate men and of him who has the greatest right to a child
(1498) 5 " Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported from his father that an effeminate, present at Oum Salama, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), said to Abdallah Ibn Abi Oumaya, and the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), was listening to him: "O Abdallah! if Allah will grant you tomorrow, the conquest of Taif, I will guide you to the daughter of Ghailan, who has four folds in front, and as she walks away, she shows eight". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) then said: "Do not let such a man enter your home" (....) 6 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad say: “A woman of the Ansars, was married to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, she bore him Assem , and after that he repudiated her. Arriving at Quba, he found his son Assem playing in the courtyard of the mosque; so he took him by his arm and placed him in front of him on his horse. Immediately the grandmother of the child, arrested him and took the child away from him . Then both went to Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq where Omar exclaimed, "he is my son", and the woman from him said, "he is mine". Then Abu Bakr, addressing Omar, said to him: "Do not come between the mother and her child"; and Omar did not repeat his request. - Malek on this subject says: “This is what I want to follow”. Chapter VII The defect of a commodity and its guarantee (1499) - About the man who buys a commodity, an animal, or a garment or any other commodity, and that he finds that this sale does not is not approved, so that he decides to return what he bought, Malek said: "The owner of the goods only receives from his price the sum which was paid to him, the day he bought it. sold, because the seller had guaranteed the goods on the day the sale was decided; thus any defect or lack, found in the goods, after the date of the sale, returns to the purchaser, given that his usufruct or the increase in the price returns to him. Also, it is possible that the buyer buys a commodity at a time when it is in demand and consumed, then decides to return it when it is no longer suitable for sale. For example, a man buys goods for ten dinars, keeps it, then wants to return it, when its price is only one dinar; this is not allowed to him as long as he causes the seller the loss of nine dinars; so either he resells it at this price or keeps it. On the other hand, if the buyer was going to return the goods, the very day of his purchase, he should have taken back the ten dinars he had paid, and no longer the price he must have on the day he decided to make it become, moreover, one dinar, causing the seller to lose nine dinars”. What justifies this, says Malek, is the following: “When a thief, steals an object; the price of this object is estimated on the day the theft was committed, so that it is decided to cut off his hand, even if the decision is delayed, and the thief is in prison. If the thief had fled, and then was, after a certain time, arrested, and if, on the other hand, the value of the object had been reduced in such a way that the prescribed penalty can no longer be applied, this fall in price, is not to be considered. It is also not considered that the offense is not subject to the prescribed penalty on the day of the theft, and that the price has increased when the thief has been imprisoned and therefore the prescribed penalty to which he finds subject, will no longer apply to him". Chapter VII General Chapter on Passing Judgments and Despising Him
(1500) 7 Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Abu-Al-Darda had written to Salman al-Farisi, "Come to the Holy Land, to which Salman replied, "The land sanctifies no one; rather it is his works which make man holy. I have been told that you have been appointed a judge, in charge of the affairs of the people; so if you succeed in judging justly, happiness be granted to you, and if you do not succeed, take your precautions not to kill a man, and that you find yourself in Hell". Thus, each time Abu Al-Darda, wanted to judge two litigants, when they left, he stared at them and said to them: "Come back to me, and tell me again, your accusations; by Allah, I give only proper judgments." - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "Whoever seeks the help of a slave , without having had the permit of his master, in order to perform any work for him where he will pay him a salary, he must ensure the safety of this slave. work without being subjected to either an accident or any harm whatsoever, if the master of this slave claims his salary, the man must pay it to him. And this is what is followed with us (in Medina)”. - Also Malek said: "in case a slave is half-freed half-slave, he retains for himself, his salary, however, he will not be able to fully dispose of this salary, except for what is his food and of his clothing as far as possible; but if he dies, all his money goes to the man who did not free him”. - Finally, Malek said: “The norm followed in Medina, allows the father to claim from his son, the expenses that he had made to him, if this one already has goods; whether it be flowing funds or goods, according to what the father envisages”.
(1501) 8 - Omar Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Dalaf Al-Mouzani reported from his father that a man from Jouhaina, anticipated the period of the pilgrimage, bought mounts to make them more expensive, then hastened to arrive more sooner than the pilgrims. He went bankrupt, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab was informed about him, who said: “This done, O men! This man Oussaïfé of the Jouhaina tribe was satisfied, that people say of him, about his faith and his sincerity, that he arrived before the pilgrims. Now, he has become indebted, and is in a difficult situation, those to whom this man owes money, let them come to us tomorrow morning, so that we share with them what he left. . So, avoid debt, because its beginning is a pain, and its end is an embarrassment”. Chapter IX The Subject of Losses and Injuries Caused by Slaves. (1502) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say, "The sunnah followed in Medina, regarding an offense caused by the slave, requires the following: "Anything that a slave may cause, injury to a person, or an object he steals, or a sheep which he seizes at night outside an enclosure, or a branch of a tree, which bears fruit, he cutting or destroying him, or again any kind of theft, which is not subject to the prescribed penalty requiring the hand to be cut off, and which, generally, does not exceed the price of this slave. to the master of the slave, who returns, the payment of the indemnity of this crime, and he keeps his slave, or he delivers him to the damaged person, as he will choose, without he owes anything else” . Chapter X What is permitted as a gift
(1503) 9 - Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab reported that Osman Ibn Affan said: "Whoever makes a gift to his minor child without the latter being able to take care of it, he must declare his gift publicly, confirmed by witnesses, this is permitted to the father and he has the right to recover it, in case his son dies”. - Malek said: "The rule followed among us (in Medina), concerning the one who makes, to his minor son, a gift, of gold or silver, and that he dies, so that his son inherits it, nothing will return to the latter, except in the case where his father had completely set aside this gift, or that he had given it in deposit to a third person; if he does so, this gift will be of the right of the son”. MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 38 The Book of Emancipation and Patronage Chapter I Of the one who frees his share in a slave
(1504) 1 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "Whoever frees his share in a slave, all by having enough money, for the price of the slave, one will estimate the value of this slave, so that the one who took the initiative of the postage, pays to the associates, their shares, making that his postage is total; otherwise, the slave will not be completely freed”. - Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina), concerning the slave whom his master has partially freed, and whom the associates have freed either by a quarter, or by a third or by a half, that this slave does not is only partially franked, according to what has been quoted from by his master. Consequently this partial emancipation is obligatory, as long as the man (owner of the slave) is dead, although if the latter were still alive, he should have had a complete choice in this matter. Thus, after the death of the master (the testator), the slave finds himself only partially freed, namely, in proportion to the value of the bequest made by the deceased; as for the inheritance of the latter, it is the right of the heirs. This done, how can one demand of others that they free the slave, without for all that they themselves having taken the initiative for the freeing, or even that they have put it in motion? evidence; consequently, they no longer even have the right of patronage. So, in fact, it is the man who died, who was for the emancipation of the slave and to whom belongs the right of patronage, without however entrusting others with the emancipation of their shares. However, if the deceased had, in his will, made a legacy where one must pay to the others their shares for the total emancipation of the succession, the slave will be absolutely freed and the partners will not have to refuse this, as long as the deceased had disposed of a third of his property, without this causing damage to his heirs”. - And Malek to say: “If a sick man frees the third of the slave and that definitively, this one will be absolutely freed thanks to this third of the inheritance; this case is not similar to that where a man makes a legacy to free the third of his slave, after his death, for the good reason, that if this man is still alive, he will have the right to return on this legacy, and no longer free his slave. Also, the slave, whose master freed him from the third, while he was sick, should have, if he had still been alive, totally freed his slave. But if the man dies, the slave will be freed from a third party, since the dead person has the right to bequeath a third of his property just as a healthy man can enjoy all his property”. Chapter II The Condition of Postage
(1505) 2 - Malek said: "The slave who has been absolutely freed so that he can be given all the rights of a free man, namely the testimony, and the inheritance, his master can no longer to submit to the conditions to which another slave is subjected, such as the payment of the price of liberty, or work to be done, or to subject him to a burden of slavery, for the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him be the grace and peace of Allah) said: their share, while alone assuming the complete emancipation of this slave ”. - Malek said: "Thus, since this slave belongs to this man alone, instead of partially freeing him, it is his right to free him completely and to free him completely." Chapter III He who frees his slaves without having any other property
(1506) 3 - Muhammad Ibn Sirin reported that a man, at the time of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had freed, at his death, his six slaves without possessing other property. Thus, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) drew lots to free a third of these slaves”. - Malek said: “I was told that the man in question did not have any other property”. (1507)4- Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdul-Rahman reported that a man had, when Aban Ibn Osman was governor in Medina, freed all his slaves, without having owned any other property apart from them. Then Aban ordered, to distribute these slaves in three categories, then made on their subject, a draw, so that one can indicate the third of these slaves who, later, was freed”. Chapter IV Of the judgment made concerning the property of a slave, if he is freed
(1508) 5 Malek reported that he heard Ibn Chehab say: "The sunna requires that, as soon as the slave is freed, he must have all his property". - Malek also said: "What justifies that the freed slave must have his property is that the contractual freedman says: "Al-Mukatab", has his freedom which belongs to him in person, and also to his property, even if he did not ask for it; this is explained by the fact that the contract of emancipation is also a contract of patronage, if this has already been decided, without it being considered that the goods of the slave and of the contractual freedman are taken from it. same title as their children. In fact their children are like them slaves, and are not taken as property, because it is the sunna, incontestably followed, that the freed slave must have his property, but without this freeing his children; it is the same for the contractual freedman, who released, this will be it for his goods, but not for his children. - Malek further added: "what justifies this is that, as long as the slave and the contractual freedman, know deficit, one must remove their goods and their wives, independently of their children because those these are not good for them. Also, this is justified by the fact that, if the slave is sold, and its buyer demands to still have his property, his children will not be part of his property. Eventually, Malek says, "if the slave is injured, he himself is taken as well as his property, regardless of his children." Chapter V The Liberation of Enslaved Mothers and the Judgment Made About Emancipation
(1509) 6 - Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “Any slave who gives birth to a child of her master, this one can neither sell her, nor make her a gift, nor consider her heiress; however he can enjoy his person, and at his death, he will be liberated”.
(1510) 7 - It was reported to Malek, that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, had received in his home a slave whom his master had tortured with fire, or with what, he had harmed her, Omar freed her». - Malek said: "What is unquestionably followed among us (in Medina) is that we do not tolerate the release of a man whose debt is beyond his value, nor even the postage of 'a young slave until he has reached the age of puberty, nor the release of a slave, who is pubescent and who does not however have the right to dispose of his property until he actually has the right to dispose of it”. Chapter VI Slaves whom it is permitted to free when freeing is obligatory
(1511) 8 - Umar Ibn Al-Hakam reported: “I came to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) and said to him: “O Messenger of 'Allah I have a slave who leads the herd to pasture; when I met her, I realized that she had lost a sheep, I asked her to explain this to me, and she replied that the wolf devoured her, I got angry, and being a human being, I slapped her. I had a slave to free, can I free her in her place? The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) asked the slave: “Where is Allah”? In heaven, she replied”; he asked him: "Who am I"? Responding to her: “You are the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), he then said: “Release her”.
(1512) 9 - Oubaidallah Ibn Abdallah Ibn Utba Ibn Mass'oud reported: "A man of the Ansars, brought a black slave, with him, came to find the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and said to him: "O Messenger of Allah, I have to free a slave, but if you find that this slave is a believer, I will free her". The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) addressing the slave said to him: "Do you bear witness that there is no other divinity than Allah”? "Answering yes", he asked him again: "Do you bear witness that I am the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam)"? "Responding, again, with a yes", he finally asks her: "Do you believe in the resurrection after death"?; his answer being, a yes, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) then said to the man: “release her”.
(1513) 10 • Al-Maqbouri reported that Abu Huraira was asked, concerning the man who has a slave to free, will he be able to free an adulterine slave”? Abu Houraira replied: “yes, certainly, and that will be considered a release for him”.
(1514) 11 - Fadala Ibn Oubaid Al-Ansari, who moreover, was one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and peace of Allah), was asked about a man, who has a slave to free, will he be permitted to free an adulterous slave? “Yes, certainly, he replied, and that will be considered a release for him”. Chapter VII What is not tolerated as mandatory release
(1515) 12 - It was reported to Malek, that Abdallah Ibn Omar, was requested to determine if one could buy a slave for the specific purpose of the obligatory emancipation of a slave”? He replied, “No”. - Interpreting this, Malek said, “This is the best I have heard about compulsory franking of a slave or slave, where whoever intends to frank it, does not have to buy it later , nor does it advance such a condition. For, if he were to do so, his emancipation would not be complete, as long as he paid for this slave a price lower than his real price. And Malek added: “There is no harm in a man freely buying a slave and then freeing him”. - On the other hand, Malek said, “The best I have heard about the compulsory freeing of a slave is that you cannot free a Christian, or a Jew, or a contract slave, nor a posthumous freedman, nor a slave who became a mother, nor a slave for a term of a few years, nor a blind man. But, there is no harm in arbitrarily releasing a Christian, a Jew or a Magus, for Allah, Blessed and Most High, has said in His Book { فَإِمَّا مَنًّا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَاء } (the meaning): "Then you choose between their release and their ransom” (Koran XLVII, v.4). This liberation is nothing other than emancipation”. - Malek finally said: "Thus, the slaves, mentioned in the Book of Allah, who are to be freed, must only be believers". Similarly, when it comes to giving food to the poor, under the title of an expiation, it can only be done for Muslims, emphasizing that this is not allowed for those who are of a other religion”. Chapter VIII The liberation made by a living person for a dead person
(1516) 13 - Abdul Rahman Ibn Abi Amra Al-Ansari reported that his mother wanted to make a will, and delayed it until the morning she died, when she intended to free a slave”. Thus, Abdul Rahman, questioned Al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad on this subject, and asked her, if she will be rewarded if he frees the slave in her place, Al-Kassem replied: "Sa'd Ibn Oubada had asked , the same question to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and he answered him: “Yes”.
(1517) 14 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Abdul-Rahman Ibn Abu Bakr died accidentally, Aisha, the wife of the Prophet r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) freed in her title, several slaves». Malek said, "That's the best I've heard." Chapter IX The excellence of freeing a slave, a profligate, and an adulterer
(1518) 15 - Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) was asked r ( Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) which of the slaves, is it better to free”? He replied, "The one that is the most expensive, and that his master most wants to retain." (...) 16 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar freed an adulterer and his slave mother». Chapter X The right to grant patronage to him who makes the postage
(1519) 17 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported: “Barira comes to tell me: “I had concluded with my masters, to pay them, about my postage , nine ounces of silver, so that one ounce is paid every year, and I ask you to support me”. Aicha replied: “If your people accept that I pay them this sum in your place so that you are freed, I will do it, on condition that I patronize you”. Going to his masters to teach them, Aisha's proposal, and they refused it, Barira returned to Aisha, while the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him grace and peace of Allah) was at her house, and said to her: "I had told them your proposal, but they refused it, wanting to have the right of my patronage to them". Listening to this, the Messenger of Allah r (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah) asked Aisha to explain it to him; Once informed, he spoke to Aicha, saying to her: "bring her, and ask them, the right to patronize her, because this right belongs to the one who freed", Aicha, accomplishes what he says to him ; the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) stood up, among the people, then gave praise and glorification to Allah, and said: “Then! What happens to men to put forward conditions, which are not in The Book of Allah? thus, any condition which has not been mentioned in The Book of Allah, is invalid, even if such conditions are one hundred in number; therefore the right of Allah is the most meritorious and the strongest, moreover, the right of patronage belongs to the one who frees.
(1520) 18 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that Aicha, the mother of the believers intended to buy a slave to free her, the masters of this one said to her: "We will sell her to you, only on condition that we hold the right of his patronage". Aisha, making this known to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) he said to him: "Let nothing prevent you from buying it and freeing it ; for patronage is the right of the person who made the postage”.
(1521) 19 - Amra Bint Abdul Rahman reported that Barira, came to ask Aicha, the mother of the believers, to support her, she said to him: "If your masters want me to pay them the whole sum, so that I emancipation, I will do it”. Barira, made this known to his masters, they refused him saying: "No, except, in case we have the right to patronize you". Amra, learned this from Aisha, she reported it in turn to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam), (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said to her: "Buy it, and freed -the, because, the right of the patronage belongs to that which freed”.
(1522) 20 Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam),r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) forbade the sale of the right of patronage, and to make it a donation". - About a slave who is bought from his masters, on condition that he himself chooses the one who will patronize him, Malek said: “This is not allowed, because patronage is the right of the one who freed . Although if a man gives to him whom he enfranchises the right to belong to him whom he chooses for himself, this is not permitted either, for the Envoy of 'Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "The patronage is the right of the one who freed", prohibiting however, that this right is sold, or given as a gift. Thereby. if the man tolerates to his freedman the right to choose himself, his boss, or even that he allows it, this is considered as a gift, is moreover prohibited”. Chapter XI Liberation, which involves the right of patronage
(1523) 21 • Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman reported that Al-Zoubair Ibn Al-Awam bought a slave and set him free. This slave, had children of a free woman, and Al-Zoubair having freed him, says to him: “These children are my freedmen”, and on their behalf, the close relations of the mother claim them as being of theirs. Bringing their accusations to Osman Ibn Affan, he gave Al-Zoubair the right to patronize them”. (...) 22 - It was reported to Malek, that Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab, asked about a slave who has children from a free woman, to whom should we give the right to patronize them? Sa'id replied, "If their father dies, before he is freed, the right of their patronage reverts to their mother's relatives." - Malek said: "This case is to be compared to that of an adulterine child, who, attached to his mother's relatives, patronize him, inherit him even if he dies, and still pay him the legal compensation or blood money in case he commits a crime or misdemeanor. However, if his father recognizes him (as a son), this child will be attached to him and his relatives, and as a result may inherit him, just as they will pay him legal compensation or blood money, if he had committed a crime or misdemeanor, on the other hand, her father will be subjected to the prescribed penalty (namely that he will be flogged". - Malek to continue: "The same is true in the case of a free woman Arab, practicing adultery, if her husband accuses her about it and calls a curse on her, and does not recognize the son brought into the world, However, the inheritance of this child at his death, will revert to the Muslims , after the part of the mother and of his uterine brothers has been set aside, unless the father does not attach the child in question to him, for this child, before he was recognized by his father, he had been subordinated to the patronage of his mother's relatives, since he had neither belonging nor "assaba". Thus, thanks to the recognition of the father, his belonging returned to his n “assaba”. - Malek to add: "what is followed, among us (in Medina), about a child whose father is a slave, and the mother is free, and that it happens that the father of the slave is free, is that the grandfather, that is, the father of the slave, can take away the right to patronize free children, born of a free woman; therefore, this grandfather can inherit them, as long as their father is still a slave. However, if the slave father is freed, the right of the children's patronage goes to the relatives of the father, and if he dies while being a slave, their patronage and inheritance goes to the grandfather. If the slave has two free children, and one of them dies while the father is a slave, the grandfather takes the right of both patronage and inheritance”. - On the other hand, about a slave, who finds herself freed while she is pregnant, while her husband is a slave, then he is freed after she has given birth to her child, Malek said: "The patronage of the newborn is the right of him who had freed his mother, for this infant would have been subject to slavery, if his mother had not previously been freed, especially since he is not considered on the same footing of equality as the one, who was still in the lap of his mother, after his emancipation; for if it were so, and his father is no longer a slave, he takes away the right to patronize him”. - Finally, Malek said: "For the slave who asks his master to allow him the freedom of another slave who belongs to him, and that his master grants it to him: the right of patronage belongs to the master of the slave and no longer to the slave who had been freed". Chapter XII The Subject of the Legacy of the “Walaa”
(1524) 23 - Hisham reported from his father, that Al-Assi Ibn Hisham died leaving three sons, two of whom are siblings, and the other is consanguineous. One of the two siblings having died, leaving property and freedmen, it was his full brother who inherited the property and the Walaa of the freedmen. Then the latter, dying in his turn, he leaves a son, and a consanguineous brother. Thus, his son said, “I have the right to inherit all that my father had acquired in property and also the Walaa of the freedmen. However, the consanguineous brother, protesting, said to him: “No, you only have the right to inherit the goods, as for the Walaa, you do not have the right. Besides, if my brother died today, wouldn't I have the right to inherit him? Both bringing their accusations to Omar Ibn Affan, the latter granted the Walaa to the brother”.
(1525) 24 - Abdallah Ibn Abi Bakr Ibn Hazm reported from his father, that while sitting at Aban Ibn Osman, a group from Bani Jouhaina, and another from Bani Khazraj, submitted their differences to him, on occasion from which, he was told that a woman from Jouhaina who was the wife of Al-Hareth Ibn Al-Khazraj called Ibrahim Ibn Koulaib, died, leaving property and freedmen. Thus, her son and her husband inherit it; then his son died, his heirs said: “it is up to us to have the Walaa (1) of the freedmen as long as it is the son who enjoyed this right”. The men of the Jouhaina replied, “No, it is not so, because the heirs are only freedmen of the mother, who was one of us; but her son being dead, the Walaa is our right, and we must inherit them”. Thus Aban granted the men of Jouhaina the Walaa». (1) The Walaa is said of any right of patronage, to the holding of the one who makes a postage, by proceeding to multiple means such as the contract, or posthumous, or other.
(1526) 25 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab said about a man who dies leaving three sons, and freedmen, after which two of his sons die, leaving children”. Sa'id says, “the third son will inherit the Walaa; and if he dies in his turn, the Walla of the freedmen will be granted both to the children of the one who has just died, and to the children of his brother, in an equitable and legitimate manner”. Chapter XIII Of the inheritance of the slave known as "Saiba" and of the Walaa of those who emancipate Jews and Christians
(1527) 26 - Malek asked Ibn Chehab, about the "Saiba"? He replied, “He can give the right of his patronage to whomever he wishes; so if he dies, he will not grant it to anyone, his inheritance will therefore go to the Muslims, who are responsible for paying him the legal compensation”. - Malek said: “The best thing I've heard about the 'Saiba' is that it's not owned by anyone; as for his inheritance, it is the right of the Muslims, on condition that they pay him the legal compensation, if he had to do so”. - And Malek to add: "In case the slave of a Jew or a Christian, becomes a partisan of Islam, and that his master frees him before he is sold, the Walaa of this freed slave, reverts to Muslims; and if the Jew or the Christian, in turn, become partisans of Islam, the Walaa of the liberated will not be his. But if a Jew or a Christian releases a slave, while he is of their religion, after which he will have converted to Islam, even before those who released him, namely the Jew or the Christian , have themselves converted to Islam, the Walaa returns to the freer, because this was justified to him from the very day he freed”. “Saiba” (2) This refers to the slave, freed by his master, without his granting him the right of patronage, but rather giving it to the freedman. - Malek finally said: "If a Jew or a Christian had a Muslim child, he inherits the freedmen from his Jewish or Christian father if the freedman showed himself to be a follower of Islam before this was followed by the franking agent; on the other hand, the Muslim child of a Jew or a Christian does not inherit the Walaa of the freed Muslim, as long as this Walaa does not belong to the Jew or to the Christian, but to the Muslim community. . MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 39 The Book of the contractual freedman and said "AI-Moukatab" Chapter 1 The judgment made about the contractual freedman. (1528)1 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar said: "The moukatab says still freed by contract, will always remain held as a slave, as long as he has a certain sum, which has not yet been paid, of the price of his release.
(1529) 2 - It was reported to Malek, that Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar said: "As long as the mukatab has not yet paid the full sum, constituting the price of his emancipation, he is still a slave" . And Malek adds: “And such is my opinion”. - Malek said: "If the mukatab dies, leaving a sum of money, exceeding that which is due to him of the price of his postage which he had already concluded, or that on their subject, he had concluded a similar contract , his children will have the right to inherit what remains of his property, if the price of his postage had already been fully paid.
(1530) 3 - Houmaid Ibn Qais al-Makki reported that Ibn al-Moutawakel had a mukatab, who died in Mecca, leaving in his charge some terms of the price of his postage as well as the debts he owed to the people, and leaving one more daughter. The prefect of Mecca, falling into embarrassment, wanting to judge this affair, he sent to ask in writing on this subject, to Abdul Malek Ibn Marwan, who in turn answered him in writing: "First of all acquit the debts of creditors, then completes what remains of the price of his emancipation, and finally, shares equally what remains of his property, between his daughter and his master". (1) "The moukatab" is said of the slave, who must obtain from his master, a postage, having concluded with him a contract by virtue of which he will pay him a determined sum and which extends according to the terms of this contract. This type of contract has been given the name of “kitaba”. - Malek said: “What is followed (with us) in Medina is that the master of the slave is under no obligation to conclude a contract with his slave, if the latter asks him to do so. And I haven't even heard of any imam forcing a master to make such a contract with his slave. Again, I happened to know that, when asked about this, a man versed in religion replied: “Allah Blessed and Most High said (meaning): “…..Write a postage contract for those of your slaves who desire it, if you recognize in them qualities…..” (Koran XXIV, verse 33), still this man recited the two following verses (meaning): “….hunt when you have returned to the profane state….” (Koran V, 2) and: “….when the prayer is finished, disperse yourselves in the land, and seek the grace of Allah” (Koran LXII, 10). Interpreting this, Malek said, “This, is a tolerance from Allah, granted to people although it is not obligatory. - Malek said: "I heard some men versed in religion, say about the following verse: "...and give them the goods that Allah has granted you..." (Koran XXIV.33), which one implies, that the man can conclude a contract of emancipation with his slave, then can make a handing-over of a determined sum to him at the end of the acquittal. This, moreover, is what I have heard men versed in religion say and which has been followed by people in Medina. I was even told that Abdallah Ibn Omar had concluded a freeing contract with his slave for a sum which is thirty and five thousand dirhams, and as a result, he gave him a discount of five thousand " . - On the other hand Malek added: “What is followed in Medina, regarding the slave with whom his master had concluded a contract of freedom, is that the latter will release the goods of the freedman, this who will not be for his children, unless the master had them, again, included in the contract”. - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say about the "mukatab", who had concluded a contract of emancipation with his master, while having with him a pregnant slave, whose business he did not know, as well as his master, during the contract, that the child once born, will not be part of the contract, and will therefore be a slave of the master; as for the female slave, she is already freed because she was an integral part of the property of the mukatab”. -About a man who, inheriting from his dead wife, as well as her son, a mukatab, Malek said: "If the mukatab dies before he has paid his Kitaba, the man and son will divide his inheritance according to what is prescribed in the Book of Allah; but if the moukatab had paid in full the price of his postage, all his inheritance will revert to the son without anything being given to the husband”. - About the mukatab who concludes with his slave a Kitaba, Malek said: "We check this contract, so if it was done on the part of the Moukattab to be kind to his slave, and to want him to lighten his work, that is not tolerated. But if this contract was made by desire, or by need of money, or even still to have the advantage and the assistance, that is tolerated. -About the man, who concluded with his (female) slave a contract, Malek said: “If, for having had relations with her, she became pregnant, she will have to choose: or that she is the mother of the child, or that she be freed, once her Kitaba was accomplished. If it turns out that she is not pregnant, she is at her kitaba”. - Malek said: “what is followed with us (in Medina) in case a slave is owned by two men is that it is not tolerated that one of them concludes a Kitaba , while his partner wants to allow it or not, as long as the two must consult on the Kitaba, because this constitutes for the slave a complete emancipation. If this Kitaba is made by one of the two partners, the slave will be half freed, and the other partner cannot be made to free the other half; therefore, it will be a contradiction to the words of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) who said: "He who frees the portion he possesses concerning a slave, must free him completely if that is possible for him, after having made the valuation of the slave”. - Malek to continue: "if the partner ignores the Kitaba of the other until the slave has completed the payment of his Kitaba or even before, one must return to him what he had already paid, and the two partners will share the amount already paid between them in proportion to their share; consequently the Kitaba will be annulled, and the slave will remain common to both partners”. - For the contractual freedman who belongs to two men, and it is the case that one of them has granted the slave a period of time to pay, as for the other, he has refused him , the latter is inclined, says Malek, to fix what is his right, especially if the slave dies, leaving a sum that does not allow him to pay it in full”. Still on this subject, Malek said: “both partners will receive what is due to them, in a proportional way, each his share; as for what is of the remainder of the price of the franking which is as a surplus left by the slave, it will be divided between the two partners with equality. If the slave had not fully paid the whole sum, and the one who had refused to grant him a delay had received more than his partner of the sum in question, the price of the slave would be shared equally. between the two partners, and the sum already received by one of the partners is not to be reimbursed, because he only received it after consultation with his partner. On the other hand, if one of the two partners had made a remission of what he owes, and the other had received an additional sum, the latter owes nothing with regard to the first who had no debt. elsewhere received than was due to him; as for the price of the slave, it is to be divided equally between the two. This case is to be compared to that where one has a debt which a single debtor must discharge to two men where one of them had granted him a delay, while the other had already partially recovered what is in his right, and the debtor is made bankrupt; thus the creditor who had already received part of the debt, does not have to repay any sum to the other”. Chapter II Of the guarantee of the price of postage
(1531) 4 - Malek said, "what is unquestionably followed in Medina, when a group of slaves enters into a collective freeing contract, is that each can be surety for the others, and nothing of the price of their freeing is to be postponed on the death of one of them, as long as their contract is collective. Thus, if one of them declares that he is unable to pay, his companions can assign him a job that he can accomplish according to his abilities, while maintaining their solidarity with him, so that he will be freed when they are all freed, or he will remain a slave as long as they are". - Malek to continue: "what is followed with us (in Medina), about a slave concluding with his master, a contract of emancipation, is that this master does not have the right to accept that 'another takes charge in his place, the guarantee about his slave, that he dies or becomes incapable of acquittal. Also, this is not the sunnah of Muslims, because if a third person guarantees the slave, and the latter is still unable to pay, even though the master has already recovered the amount of the contract of the guarantor, he would thus have had illicit money, namely that, on the one hand he did not buy the slave and what he will have paid as price will return to him, and on the other hand the slave will not have been freed against the illicit price of his freedom. If the slave finds himself unable to pay his own price, it remains his master's propriety that the contract of freedom is not taken as a debt guaranteed by a third person, but rather considered an obligation which, once the slave fulfills it, will be set free. On the other hand, if the contractual freedman dies, while having a debt to pay, the creditors will not have to claim what remains of the Kitaba of this slave, of his master, although they have on this subject , their primacy in relation to the master, Finally, if the contractual freedman finds himself unable to pay the debt he owes to people, he will remain a slave belonging to his master, and his debt will remain at his debit, without only insofar as it is the right of the creditors to share its price which is, in fact, an asset due to its master”. - Finally Malek said: "If a group of slaves concludes a collective contract of emancipation, without having between them a family tie which allows them to inherit one from the other, they will be considered in full defense the from each other, and still guaranteeing each other mutually, they will all be freed only after having paid the amount of the contract. In the event that one of them dies, leaving to himself property, the value of which exceeds the sum which they all together owe, the sum which they owe is subtracted, and for what remains, it returns to the master. of the slave without the other slaves having anything to do with it. Also, the master will claim from the slaves, the payment of what they owed, namely the sum which was subtracted from them of the goods left by the dead slave, for the good reason, that this one, had given them the price they had to pay, to be freed, and which was his own property. On the other hand, if the dead slave had a child who will have to be born after the freeing contract has been concluded, this child will inherit nothing from his father because the latter had not been freed before his death. dead". Chapter III Flat-rate contractual postage
(1532) 5 - It was reported to Malek that Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) concluded with her slaves, contracts of emancipation, by collecting in advance, their price and in silver and gold”. - Malek said: "What is indisputably followed about a contractual freedman, common to two masters, is that it is not permitted for one of them, to free this slave, in asking for a fixed price, without having had the consultation of his partner, since the slave in question as well as what he possesses belong to the two partners; therefore it is not tolerated that one of them seizes anything without having had the permit of the other. If one of them was going to act without having had the permission of the other, and it is made that the slave dies leaving his goods, or that he is unable to discharge his own price, the partner who had already freed the slave will have nothing of his goods, consequently he will not have to return anything of what he himself had already had, to his partner, and consequently he will not will have no rights over this slave. But whoever frees his slave for a fixed price, having had his partner's permit, then the slave finds himself unable to complete his contract of liberation, the one who had him freed can, if he wishes , return what he had already taken and will continue to enjoy his right over this slave, moreover, this is permitted to him. If the slave dies leaving property, the partner who had not yet freed him will have what is his right to what remains of the price of the postage, as for the rest of the property, it will be divided between the two partners, according to the share that each has in this slave. In the event that one of the two partners has already received the fixed price of the slave, and that, on the other hand, the other maintains the contract, then that the slave is found incapable, one will say to the first: " If you want, you can return to your partner half of the price you had already received, and the slave is in common to both of you, otherwise, the slave is the possession of the one who still holds the contract on him. . - About the slave owned by two partners, where one of them seeks to free him, for a lump sum while having had the license of the other, who in turn asks for the same sum taken by the other or more, and the slave finds himself incapable, Malek said, “The slave remains common to both, for the second has received what is his right; if he receives less than the sum received by the first and the slave finds himself incapable, which causes the first to pay to the second half of the difference of the sum he had already had provided that the slave is possessed equally between the two, this is permitted to him; in case he refuses it, the slave will remain in the possession of the second. In the event that the mukatab dies leaving property, and the partner who had already freed him, wants to return to the other half of what he had obtained more than him, in such a way that the inheritance property of the slave, in being shared equally between the two, he may do so. If the one who maintained the contract had, on his part, had the same sum as the first or even more, the inheritance will be proportionally distributed, suitably to the shares of possession as long as the second had only received what it came back to him. - Concerning the moukatab, which belongs to two partners, and where one of them frees it by receiving half of what is his right, while having had his partner's permit, as for the If the other who still maintains the contract that he receives less than the sum that the first had already had, and that the moukatab finds himself unable to complete his contract of franking, Malek said: "If the partner, who had already freed the slave, wants to return to the other half of the difference, the slave belongs to them equally, and if he refuses to return it to him, the one who maintains the contract, will have half of his partner's share ". Interpreting this, Malek says, "The slave being owned equally between them, and both of them had entered into a contract of emancipation with him for a certain sum, and then let one set the slave free while having permission on the other, thus receiving half of his share, which is a quarter of the real price of the slave, and that the latter is incapable of acquittal, it will then be said that the first partner: "You can return to your partner half of what you had touched and the slave is possessed equally by you both. If you refuse, the one who maintains the contract will be entitled to a quarter of the price and also his own half of the slave, which means that he will have in all three quarters of the slave, whereas the another will only have had a quarter, which he had refused to return”. - For the moukatab, who to want to be freed, will conclude with his master a contract of emancipation, by prescribing a debt of what remains of the price of his release, and that he dies without having been paid this debt and owed debts to others, Malek said: "the master has no right to claim what is his right before the creditors have already received what is due to them and they will even have primacy to enjoy it. On the other hand, the mukatab does not have the right to carry out such a contract, if he has a debt to pay to the people, thus becoming free while he owns nothing, because the creditors have more than the master of this slave, the right to claim their debt". So this is not tolerated for him. - Malek, finally said: "What we follow at home (in Medina), about a man, who makes with his slave, a contract of emancipation, thus stipulating a sum of gold by making him a discount of the amount of the contract, if he pays him in advance, there is no harm in that. However some have refused this kind of contract, because it is taken in the same way as a debt that a man owes to another, handing it over to him on condition that he pays it before the due date. Now, this fact is not actually a debt, but rather a lump sum, which the master asks in advance for emancipation, consequently the slave will have to enjoy the rights of inheritance, testimony and will even be subject to the prescribed penalties just like a free man. Thus, it is not about the purchase of silver against silver or gold against gold, but his case is similar to that where a man says to his slave: "Bring me such and such dinars , and you will be set free”, and he discounts her in this way. Or even that the man says: “If you bring me less than such, you will be released”, and there again, it is not a question of a well determined debt; for if the debt were such, and the slave dies or makes a deficit, the master would have the right to claim what is his remnant, of the slave's property, just as the creditors will do”. Chapter IV Wounds caused by a mukattab
(1533) 6 - Malek said: “The best I have heard about a mukattab injuring a person is the following: “If the mukattab causes injury to a third person, in such a way that 'it is subject to the payment of compensation, if he is able to do so with his kitaba, let him do so while maintaining his kitaba; but if he is unable to do so, his kitaba is not considered until he has paid the price of his crime. If he still proves unable to do so, it is up to his master to choose: either he pays the compensation and keeps the mukattab still a slave, or he hands him over to the injured man, and he will not have not to act otherwise, namely outside of these two cases". In case a good number of mukattabs have concluded a collective contract, and it happens that one of them causes an injury to a man where he has to pay compensation, Malek said: "we ask all the mukatabs to pay this compensation; thus, if they do so, they will maintain their Kitaba, otherwise, their master is granted the choice of either paying compensation for the injury and thereby keeping the mukatabs as slaves , or that he delivers the slave responsible for the injury, alone, independently of the other slaves he keeps and this, because they fail to pay the price of the crime of their companion”. - Malek said: "What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), in the event that a mukattab receives an injury deserving of compensation, or even that one of the sons of the mukattab has suffered an injury and that he either included in the kittaba, the compensation to be paid must relate to the value of the slaves; thus, the compensation paid, is to be given to the master who keeps it until the end of the kitaba to be reduced by the last term of the kitaba”. - Interpreting this, Malek said: "It is assumed that the value of the kitaba is three thousand dirhams, and that the compensation corresponding to the injury of the mukattab is one thousand dirhams, if the mukattab has returned to his master two thousand dirhams, he would be released, even if he still had his kitaba, a thousand dirhams to pay. Thus, it will be released once this sum is given to the master. If the remaining value of the kitaba is less than one thousand dirhams, the master will receive what is his right and give the surplus to the mukattab. In any case, it is better not to give the mukattab the compensation for his injury that he can either spend or consume, especially since, once he finds himself unable to discharge his kitaba, he will remain a one-eyed slave, or amputated or deformed, since his master had concluded the kitaba with him only to have a share of what he earns and also his property, and not to enslave his son, nor even to have the compensation of his wound that he will have either consumed or spent. So, just as we have shown, that compensation which is to be paid as a result of an injury caused to a mukattab or his children; born during the period of the kitaba and who are part of it, is to be given to the master who in turn will, at the mukattab, reduce it just at the end of the last term of the kitaba”. Chapter V Of the sale of the mukattab
(1534) 7 - Malek said, "What was heard best said about a man buying himself a mukatab from another is that the latter would not sell it to him, if his kitaba was made against silver or gold, namely dirhams or dinars, unless the price was that of goods to be delivered as soon as possible, on the other hand if the price is to be delayed, it will be considered as a debt against debt, but such a transaction had been prohibited”. If, on the other hand, the subject of the kitaba was a commodity which is either camels or cows or sheep or slaves, it is tolerated for the buyer to buy the moukatab against gold, money or even of a different commodity in its nature from that of the kitaba made by the master, on condition of delivering it as soon as possible and without delaying it”. - Malek to continue: "What I have heard best about a moukatab subject to sale is having much more right to his kitaba than another buyer, especially if the moukatab has all the power to be able to pay his master the price that the latter has fixed for him, so that he may be freed; consequently, that the slave proceeds to his own purchase, it is already a certain way of freeing himself. Also, postage takes precedence over any other bequest. If this mukatab belongs to several partners, and it is made that one of them will sell his share of the mukatab, whether it is half or a third or a quarter or even one share among many others , the moukatab in this case does not enjoy the right of withdrawal, because this sale is considered to be a fixed price and he can only conclude it after having had the permit of his partners. Therefore, the share sold does not constitute something sacred to him, although the mukatab will not be able to enjoy his goods. Also, that it is partially sold, this is a risk for the moukatab, because he may find himself incapable as he gradually loses his property, especially since this is not considered as the purchase of a mukatab by himself unless his master, who still has his right over him, does not authorize him to do so, and thus, this mukatab will have more, than any other right, to buy himself his share sold. - Malek again said: “The sale of one of the terms of a mukatab is illicit, because it is considered a random sale, especially in the event that the mukatab finds himself unable to discharge nothing is imposed on him; and if he dies or has a deficit and debts to pay to people, the one who had bought the term in question will have no share like the other creditors, because having thus reacted by buying this term , he is considered as the master of the moukatab who will not have to claim his kitaba like the creditors, and the same is true of the gain acquired by the moukatab which will go to the creditors without his master having the right to touch a cent". “There is no harm, continues Malek, in a mukatab buying his own kitaba either from a flowing fund, or from a commodity quite different in nature to what has been the subject of the kitaba, or even that it is of the same nature if it is cash without any delay”. - Malek also said: "the mukatab who dies leaving a wife, and small children, whether of this wife or another, in such a way that they cannot work, and about whom , there is a risk that they will become unable to pay their kitaba, Malek underlines: "We will sell the woman-slave, mother of the children, if by her price we pay the kitaba of all the children she either their own mother or not, after which they will be freed, as long as their father would not have prevented the sale of the woman-slave, if he had the risk of not being able to pay her kitaba. So therefore, for such children where one fears not being able to discharge their kitaba, one will sell the mother, and one will use her price for the acquittal, but if there is one that her price does not is not enough for the payment of the value of the kitaba, and that it is with the children unable to work, they will all remain enslaved to their master”. - Malek finally said: "what is practiced with us (in Medina) about a man who buys the kitaba of a mukatab, and that the latter dies before his kitaba is completed, the man who has bought the kitaba, has the right to inherit the moukatab; but if the moukatab finds himself incapable of acquittal with regard to the buyer, he will be his slave; on the other hand, if he pays his kitaba, he will be freed by the buyer, without the latter even having any right to the patronage which belongs to the former master with whom he had concluded the kitaba”. Chapter VI The work of the moukatab
(1535) 8 - It was reported to Malek that Urwa Ibn Al-Zoubair and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar were questioned about a man who concluded for himself and his sons, a contract of freedom, then that he dies, if his sons can work, so that they fulfill the value of this kitaba, or must they remain slaves? They replied, "Rather, they will have to work, in order that they discharge it, and nothing will be given to them (from the kitaba) on the death of their father." - “And, if they are so young, continues Malek, not even being able to support the work, one will not wait until they are older, and they will remain slaves with the master of their father, except if the moukatab - who is also their father - has left enough to fulfill the terms of the kitaba for them, until they are able to work. So, if what is left is suitable for the discharge of their kitaba, one will use this, and they will remain such, until they are able to work if they discharge, they will be freed , otherwise they will remain enslaved”. - Malek said again: “The mukatab who dies, leaving not enough money for him to fulfill his kitaba, and still have children with their mother, who are subject to the kitaba , and where the mother intends to work to ensure their life, Malek must be told that she should be given the money if she proves herself able to keep it, and still able to work. But if she is neither, nothing will be given to her, and she remains with her sons, slaves of the master of the mukatab. - Malek finally said: "If several mukatabs conclude together a single contract of franking, without them having between them a place of kinship which unites them, and that some are unable to work, while the others are, until they pay the kitaba and are all freed, those who had worked claim from those who had not worked what they had paid them, because some are the guarantors of the others”. Chapter VII Of the postage of the moukatab in case he has paid what he owed before the fixed term.
(1536) 9 - Malek reported that he heard Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdul Rahman and others, tell about a mukatab that belonged to Al-Fourafissa Ibn Umair al-Hanafi, propose to the latter who is his master , to pay him all he owes him from his kitaba, but Al-Fourafissa refused. Thus, the mukatab went to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam, who was at that time, governor of Medina and told him his business; Marwan summoned al-Fourafissa and asked him to accept, but when the latter refused, Marwan ordered that the mukatab's money be taken and deposited in the public treasury, then told the mukatab: “Go ahead! you are freed, Al-Fourafissa seeing this, agreed to have the money». - Malek said: "What is followed with us (in Medina), about the mukatab is that he is tolerated to pay what he owes of his kitaba before the due date, and his master does not has no right to refuse it; also he will have to free the mukatab from any condition by allowing him to work and travel, since the emancipation of a slave is not complete if he is even partially enslaved by it, and therefore his condition social will not be sacred, its testimony will not be considered nor will it have to inherit; so he will not enjoy any other rights if he still has to pay part of his kitaba. As for his master, he will not have the right to impose work on him, after his emancipation”. - Malek finally said: "About the mukatab who falls seriously ill, and therefore intends to pay all that he owes of his terms to his master, with the aim that his free children inherit him without their being subjects of the kitaba, Malek points out, that this is permissible for him, for thus his social condition will be sacred, his testimony admitted, his declaration of debts to others accepted, and his will tolerated. Therefore, his master will not have to deny him, claiming to say, "he escaped me by paying the terms of his kitaba." Chapter VIII The succession of the moukatab in the event that he is freed
(1537) 10 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab, was questioned about a mukatab common to two masters where one of them had freed his share, following which the mukatab died leaving a good sum of money, which Sa'id said, "Whoever maintained the kitaba will be given his share, and the rest will be shared equally between the two patrons." - Malek said: "The mukatab, who has completed his kitaba, and then who is freed, will be inherited from by the men who are closest to him and with whom he had concluded the contract of franking, the day the mukatab dies, whether the heirs are his children or close relatives. It is also, continues Malek, the case of any freed man, where his inheritance goes to those he is closest to those who freed him, namely children or close relatives, on the day of the death of the mukatab , after he is freed, and therefore inherited by patronage”. - Malek finally said, "Brothers in the kitaba are taken the same as children, in case they all made one postage contract, and it is done that none of them has a child, a subject included in the contract, or even born during the kitaba, or whether he is a subject of the kitaba and then one of them dies leaving money, this is used money to pay for the discharge of what is still due from the terms of the kitaba, and they are freed. As for the rest of the money, it will go to his children independently of his brothers”. Chapter IX The conditions imposed on the mukatab
(1538) 11 - About a man who concluded with his slave a kitaba, to be exchanged for gold or silver, by advancing him as a condition in the kitaba, to make a trip, or to to perform a service or even to offer him an animal for sacrifice, seeking thereby to cite everything clearly in the contract, since it is the fact that the mukatab was able to pay everything, from his terms even before the due date , Malek said, “If he has paid all of his terms, and submitted to the condition in question, he will be released and his social condition will be created. Then, we will discuss the condition which subjects him to a service to be rendered or to a journey to be made, or another action which is similar to them, which he can, if need be, accomplish himself, and we rid of this burden, without his master having the right to oblige him to discharge it. As for the sacrifice or clothing or something similar, it will be taken in the same way as the dinars or the dirhams, where one seeks to evaluate it, so that the moukatab pays it with the terms of the contract; therefore, he will not be freed until he has paid everything”. - Malek said: “What is followed here (in Medina), and what is also indisputable is that the mukatab is considered as a slave that the master frees after having enslaved him for ten years. Gold; if the master who freed the slave is dead, before the latter has completed ten years of enslavement at home, which remains of this period, the slave will spend it in the service of the heirs of his master; as for his patronage, it returns to him who had freed him, as well as to his sons and close relatives”. - Concerning the man who submits his mukatab to the condition of not traveling, nor marrying, nor leaving the country without having had his permission, and consequently if the mukatab does one or the other before he has permission, and his kitaba is within reach of the man threatening to cancel it, Malek said, "this man has no right to cancel the kitaba, even if the mukatab had done what is against the condition in question; rather, this man will bring his accusation to the Sultan; thus, the mukatab will not have to marry, nor to travel, nor to leave the country without the permission of his master, whether this is an imposed condition or not, as long as the latter has to conclude a contract of franking with his slave for the value of one hundred dinars, while the moukatab has a nest egg of one thousand dinars or more; therefore, the slave will go and marry a woman, giving her a dowry whose value exceeds the whole sum in question, which will cause the incapacity of the mukatab; consequently, he will return to his master a penniless slave, or that he will travel, neglecting the terms of his kitaba, by his absence, which, in fact, he is not tolerated. For this reason, and according to the kitaba, the master has the full right either to authorize it or to refuse it”. Chapter X Patronage of the mukattab in case he is freed
(1539) 12 - Malek said: “If the mukatab frees his slave, without having had the permission of his master, it is not permitted for him. But if the master of the mukatab allows it, the right of patronage of the freedman reverts to the mukatab (if he had paid his kitaba). On the other hand if the mukatab dies, before he is freed, the right of the patronage of the slave goes to the master of the mukatab, and if the freed slave dies before the mukatab is freed, his master will have to 'to inherit". - Malek to continue: “It is the same, if the mukatab concludes a kitaba with his slave who will be freed before the mukatab is freed by his master; thus patronage is the right of the master of the moukatab as long as he is not completely freed. But if he is freed, the patronage returns to him, namely, that he is under the right of the moukatab. If the first mukatab dies before he has paid what is due to him, or even if he is unable to do so, and he has free children, these will not inherit the right of the patronage of their father's mukatab, for the good reason that their father does not yet have the patronage in a sure and certain way, and then he will only have it if he is completely emancipated”. - Malek also said: "The mukatab which belongs to two masters and where one of them neglects his share, as for the other he maintains it, then the mukatab dies leaving money, Malek points out: "Whoever has maintained the contract of postage will be given what is still his right to the kitaba, then the two masters will share the money, as if the mukatab died as a slave, for the first, by neglecting his share which he has in the slave, had not yet completely freed him, but he had quite simply left him, what he owes him”. - And Malek to say again: "What justifies the above is that it is supposed that a man dies leaving a moukatab, and male and female children, then that one of them freed his share he has of the mukatab, this does not give him the right of patronage. But if it were a freeing, the patronage will be the right of those who have been freed, of his male and female children”. - Consider again, continues Malek, the case where one of the partners frees his share of the slave, then the slave becomes unable to pay the kitaba, we do not ask this partner what remains of the kitaba ; however, if it was a postage, he should have been asked for it in order to assess the remaining part, and thus recover it from the property of this man, and this is in accordance with the words of the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): "Whoever frees a slave for his share, if he does not have the means to free him completely, thus estimating the price of the slave at his fair value, he will be partially freed". - A third case, presented by Malek, where it is said that: "The Sunna unquestionably followed, is that, whoever frees his share of the slave, this freedom will not take into account his goods, because if he were such , he would have to enjoy, alone, the right of patronage, independently of the other partners. Also it is the sunnah of Muslims, that the right of patronage belongs to the one who concluded the kitaba, and not to those who inherit the master, from the women who had freed their shares from the slave, but rather they are the heirs males and close relatives among the males entitled to patronage”. Chapter XI Cases in which the franking of mukatabs is not permitted.
(1540) 13 - Malek said: "If several mukatabs conclude together a single contract of franking, their master does not have the right to free one of them, without his having had the agreement and the approval of others, even if they are young, although this agreement and this approval are not compulsory”. Interpreting this, Malek said, "It may be that one of them works in order to free his companions by paying them what they owe from the kitaba, the master will have to free him, which will cause for the others the inability to be able to act just like their companion. He releases the mukata for his own benefit, by causing others harm to them. And the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said: "Not to answer evil with evil", and this, is the hardest of evil ." - Finally Malek said: "In case the slaves conclude together a single kitaba, their master has to free among them the old and the small who can neither discharge, nor that one of them has, l help and power to do so. The master then has permission to do so”. Chapter XII Emancipation from the mukatab of the female slave known as “oum walad”.
(1541) 14 - Concerning the man who with his slave, concludes a kitaba, then that this slave dies leaving the woman slave, mother of his child, while he still owes part of his kitaba, and of the enough money to pay for it, Malek said: "This woman, mother of his child, always remains a slave when the mukatab is not completely freed until just upon his death, without even leaving children who would be freed once that the kitaba had been paid, so the mother of their father's child would be freed, thanks to their freedom”. - About the mukatab who frees his slave or gives alms of his money, without telling his master that once he has been freed, and Malek to emphasize on this subject: "the mukatab must accomplish his deed without going back. However, if the master of the mukatab learns what is the actions of the latter, he can prevent the mukatab from doing so, because the master, enjoying the power of emancipation, may not free his slave as he can. prevent him from giving alms, unless he allows him to give it voluntarily". Chapter XIII The Moukatab's Testament
(1542) 15 - Malek said: "The best I have heard about the mukatab from which the master frees him, on his death, is the following: the mukatab is valued, on that day, as if they wanted to sell it, and that would be its real price. Thus, if it is made that the value is less compared to what is left of his kitaba, one subtracts this from the third of his inheritance, without considering the amount of money he owes. This is explained, by the fact, that if he were killed, one would impose on his assassin only the payment of the price, valuing him, the day of his murder. On the other hand, if he had been injured, the person who had caused the injury to him will only pay as indemnity the compensation as it had been assessed on the day of the injury; and we will not consider anything of the value of the kitaba, whether in dinars or dirhams, because as long as he remains to pay of his kitaba, he is taken as a slave, even if the remaining sum is d 'a value which is less than its own value, and this is not to be subtracted from the third of the deceased's inheritance. Thus, he only has for sum what remains to him of his kitaba, as long as the dead man has made this remainder a simple legacy. - Interpreting this, Malek said: “if the value of the mukatab was one thousand dirhams, and he only had to pay from his kitaba one hundred dirhams, about which the master was going to make a bequest, this sum would be subtracted from him one-third of the inheritance and therefore he would be freed". - Concerning a man who at his death, concluded with his slave, a kitaba, Malek said: “one will evaluate his price as a slave, and in case the third of the inheritance is suitable to cover a slave, this is tolerated”. - Explaining this, Malek said: "Supposing that the value of a slave is one thousand dinars, and that his master concludes, at his death, a kitaba of two hundred dinars, thus, the third of the silver possessed by the master is a thousand dinars, so this is tolerated for him, because in fact it is a legacy he had made to him. If a master had made a legacy for other people, where it is shown that the third is only suitable for the value of the kitaba, the initiative is taken to free the moukatab, who has the privilege of doing so. legacy, which in turn will be part of the kitaba of the moukatab, so that the moukatab depends on the people to whom the legacy has been given, then the heirs of the testator are given to choose: if they want to give to these people, their entire inheritance according to the bequest, and that they have their own the kitaba of the mukatab, they can do so, and if they refuse by delivering, by the same token, the mukatab and what it owes , to people entitled to inheritance, they can also act as such, as long as the moukatab constitutes one third of the inheritance. And because everyone has the right to make a bequest, and where the heirs say: "our testator made a bequest which is beyond one third, so he got what does not belong to him", the heirs will have to choose, and they will be told: “your testator has made the legacy that you already know; so if you want to put into execution, what is of the testator, do it, otherwise give to the legatees a third of the inheritance of the deceased”. - Malek to continue: "Thus, if the successors deliver the mukatab to the legatees, the latter will have from the moukatab what is due from his kitaba, and if this moukatab performs his kitaba for good, the legatees will have, according to their shares, the value of this kitaba, but if the moukatab is unable to pay, he will be a slave of the legatees and not of the heirs, because they have handed him over to others asking them to opt. Given that the legatees have shown themselves to be guarantors with regard to the mukatab as soon as it has been delivered to them, thus, if he dies, they will have nothing to claim from the heirs. Consequently, if the mukatab dies, before he pays his kitaba, thus leaving a sum of money which is worth more than that which he owed from his kitaba, this sum will revert to the legatees; and if the mukatab had been perfectly acquitted, he would be freed, and his patronage would go to the close relatives of the man with whom the kitaba had been concluded”. - Concerning the mukatab, owing his master the sum of ten thousand dirhams, and that on his death, he gives him a discount of a thousand dirhams, Malek said: “We evaluate the mukatab, in order to fix its price; thus if it is one thousand dirhams, what is already given is only the tenth of the kitaba which is one hundred dirhams, namely a value which corresponds to one tenth of the price; therefore he will be given a rebate of the tenth of the kitaba which will effectively be the tenth of the value, as if he had been given a rebate of all that he owes. If this will be accomplished in this way, the third of the deceased's money will only be considered suitable to the value of the moukatab which is one thousand dirhams. On the other hand, if he had been given a discount equivalent to half the kitaba, this is to be calculated in one third of the money of the deceased taken for half the value; and if the discount made was less or more than half, the same method mentioned above is applied. - But, and Malek continues, if a man, at his death, gives his mukatab a discount of one thousand dirhams out of a total of ten thousand, without him quoting whether it is done just at the beginning or at the end of his kitaba, there will be a discount of one tenth for each term”. Malek said: "When a man at his death makes a rebate of one thousand dirhams to his moukatab without specifying whether it is to be made at the beginning or at the end of the kitaba which is three thousand dirhams, the assessment will be made of the moukatab by correspondence to that of money, then we will distribute this discount over all the terms of the kitaba in the following way: or calculate for each term its percentage of the discount taking into account the period which separates between your date of the man's death and that of the due date; or subtract this percentage from each term until total payment, that is, the price of the moukatab must be taken into consideration as the basis of the kitaba, spread over several terms. Once this operation is completed, one third of the estate of the deceased is calculated, if this discount is equal to or less than it, the case is settled, if it turns out that it is greater than it, then the difference is calculated for recover it according to the method mentioned above”. - About a man who has bequeathed a quarter of a mukatab to another, or even who has freed a quarter of this mukatab; then the man dies, and after him the mukatab, but the latter has left much more money than he should, Malek said: "We give the heirs of the possessor of the mukatab and the legatee what their is still due from the moukatab. As for the remaining sum, it will be shared, namely that the legatee will have a third of the sum once the kitaba has been completed; as for the heirs of the possessor, they will have two-thirds, because the moukatab remained a slave of his possessor as long as he owed the latter the acquittal of his kitaba and as a result, his possessor inherits it, being considered a slave. Concerning the mukatab from which the master freed him just at his death, Malek said: "If the third of the property of the dead is not enough for the kitaba to be paid in full, he will be partially freed from corresponding to the third of the property, making thus a handing over of the kitaba. For example, if the mukatab had to pay five thousand dirhams, and its value was two thousand, as for the third of the property of the deceased, it was only one thousand, half of the mukatab would be released, and the 'we would make a discount of half the kitaba'. - About a man who, in his will quotes: "such a slave of my possession is free, and to conclude a kitaba with another, Malek said: "one begins with the postage, by preference to the kitaba”. MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 40 The Book of "Moudabbar" Chapter 1 Sentences that are applied to the subject of the moudabbar (1) (1) The moudabbar, is the slave who will be freed, after the death of its possessor.
(1543) 1 - Malek said: "What is followed among us (in Medina) concerning the one who frees a slave after her death, who, pregnant, gives birth to children from him after she has been freed, but who dies before his master, Malek underlines, that his children are taken in the same way as her, namely that they are subject to the same condition, without their mother's death causing them any harm. So if the one who freed the mother was dead, they will in turn be freed if the third of the inheritance suffices as a price”. - Malek said: “Thus any female who gives birth to children, these will be treated the same as her, namely, if she is free and gives birth after being freed, her children will be free. In the event that she is subsequently freed, or is a moukataba, or is released after a few years, or is in the service of a man for a specified time, or is partially released, or is subject to 'a pawn, or mother of children, the child of any female will be in the same situation as her mother, namely, freed or enslaved, just as she is'. - Concerning a female slave, who pregnant, will be freed posthumously her child will live the same situation; besides, she is just like the woman slave whose master will free her, unaware that she was pregnant”. Thus, it is Sunnah that the child be of the same condition as its mother, namely, to be freed if she is”. - It is the same, continues Malek, for the man who buys himself a pregnant female slave, of whom he will be the possessor, whether he has asked the seller for it or not» «Besides, continues Malek, he The seller is not tolerated to sell the female slave, except for what is in his bosom, because this is a random sale which will devalue the price of the slave, without knowing if the fetus is alive or dead. This case is similar to that of a man who sells what is in the bosom of his mother (a slave), and there again, this is not tolerated for him, because it is a random sale. -Regarding a moukatab or a moudabbar who buys a slave, and having had relations with her, becomes pregnant and then gives birth, Malek said: "the child of each of them, will be in the same condition as his father at whether he is freed or a slave. Thus, if the slave is freed, the mother of his child will be part of the property he owns (moudabbar or moukattab), and therefore, he will be delivered to him, in case he is freed”. Chapter II General chapter of posthumous emancipation.
(1544) 2 - About a mudabbar who said to his master: “Hurry up and free me, and I will give you fifty dinars, paid on time, to which the master replied: “Yes, you are freed, on condition that you give me fifty dinars where you will pay me ten dinars every year", and that the moudabbar accepts, after which the master dies, two or three days after this agreement", Malek said: "His freedom is proven , the fifty dinars are a debt, his testimony is accepted, his sacred person, his inheritance is a right, he is subject to the prescribed penalties (just like a free man), however the death of his master will not cause him a remission of the debt”. - Concerning a man who posthumously frees a slave, after which this man dies, while having left some money which is available to him, and other which is not, without what is available being able to suffice at the freeing of the mudabbar slave, Malek said, "The mudabbar is made to keep his money within reach, and what he can earn from it pending determination of the amount of the master's money that will not was not available to him. Thus if the third of the total of the money is sufficient for the freeing of the slave, this one will be freed and will even have his money, in case the third was not enough, and of this fact, it will be partially franked suitably to the third, by making him keep his own money- Chapter III Of the will made during a posthumous franking.
(1545) 3 - Malek said, "What is followed with us (in Medina) in any emancipation performed by a man, which he cites in a will which he himself has made in state of health or illness is that this man can retain you, or even change it, as long as this does not consist of a posthumous emancipation, because if it is such, he has no right to retain it. - Malek to add: "And all the children born of a slave, fit to be freed by a will, without her having been a posthumous freedwoman, these children will not be freed, once she is , from the moment that her master can, if he wishes, either change his will, or that he retains her, without the emancipation of this slave being certain, moreover her situation is similar to that of a man saying to his (female) slave: if such will remain with me, until my death, she will be free”. Thus, if this slave lives in the expected condition, she will be freed, although her master, if he wishes, he can sell her with his children, because these have not had the same favor that was granted to their mother." - Malek to continue: “And freeing in a will is quite different from posthumous freeing, which the Sunnah has clearly distinguished. Moreover, if the two were the same, any testator will no longer have the right to vary his will and what is quoted therein from the emancipation, thus retaining the property of the slave without the latter being able to benefit from it. . - About a man, who, in full health, had freed all his slaves posthumously, without being the possessor of other property, Malek said: "If he had freed some of them , one before the other, we begin with the freeing of the first, then so on until we reach a third of these slaves. And if he had them, while being ill, all freed, saying: "Such will be free, then such, then such another, at the same time, in case my illness hastens my death" or even that he had them all freed posthumously, once and for all, they will enjoy a third of his inheritance, without one having priority over the other, for the good reason that it is a will, and that they have the third of the heritage to distribute between them equitably, the third of these slaves will be freed whatever the number; and none of them will have priority, if the man had freed them, while being sick”. - Concerning a man who had released a mudabbar, after which the man dies, without his having any other property than the slave-mudabbar, who has money for him, Malek said: "one will free a third of the slave, by making him keep his money within his reach”. - About a moudabbar whose master had concluded a kitaba for him, after which the latter dies, leaving only the moudabbar in question as his property, Malek said: one-third of his kitaba, and will have to pay the last two-thirds of the sum foreseen". - Finally Malek said: "For a man, who while being sick, had freed his slave, at his half or even had completely freed him, and had done the same, posthumously for another slave, before falling sick, Malek underlines: one takes care of the mudabbar first before the one who has been freed in the state of his illness, because the man can neither go back on his postage, nor retain his slave for any reason. cause. Thus, if the moudabbar is freed, the rest of the third of the property left by the dead is calculated, for the benefit of the other slave, who has already been half freed, until he is completely freed. But if the remainder of the third is not sufficient for such emancipation, the slave will be proportionally emancipated according to this remainder, after having emancipated the first mudabbar”. Chapter IV Of the cohabitation of a man with his slave whom he had freed posthumously.
(1546) 4 - Nafe' reported that Abdallah Ibn Omar had made two of his female slaves mudabara (released posthumously) and he lived with them”.
(1547) 5 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al-Mussaiab said: "In case the man posthumously frees his female slave, he can cohabit with her, without him having the right neither to sell it nor to donate it; her child also enjoys the same situation as her mother”. Chapter V On the subject of the sale of the mudabbar
(1548) 6 - Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina) about the mudabbar is that its owner can neither sell it nor change its condition. If the possessor owes a debt which he cannot pay, his creditors cannot sell him his mudabbar, as long as his possessor is still alive. But if the owner dies, without having a debt to pay, his mudabbar will profit from the third of the inheritance, being made that his possessor had enslaved him, as long as he was alive, and that the mudabbar did not had only to serve his master during his lifetime. Thus, this slave would be freed, without it being on behalf of the heirs, but rather of the entire inheritance, namely that he alone will have one-third, and the heirs two-thirds. Now, if the possessor of the moudabbar dies, while leaving other property than the moudabbar, his third is to be freed, and his two-thirds will revert to the heirs. If the owner dies, having for debt what is worth the price of the mudabbar, one sells it to pay the debt, and the third of the mudabbar will be freed. On the other hand, if the debt is only suitable for half the price of the mudabbar, or sells this half to discharge the debt, then one frees the remaining third of the mudabbar, of the remaining value of the debt, namely, of the sixth”. - Malek also said: “It is not permissible, neither to sell the mudabbar nor that someone buys it, before this mudabbar has bought itself from its possessor, and this is permissible for him. It is the same with its possessor, and this is permitted to him. It is also tolerated that one gives money to the owner of the mudabbar, so that he is freed from it. And the right of patronage will always be granted to the master of the mudabbar”. - Malek to continue: "It is not allowed to sell the service of the mudabbar, because this is random, as long as he does not even know, until when his master will remain alive". - As for the question of the slave, who, common to two men and where one of them freed his rightful share, posthumously, Malek said: “they must esteem the slave; thus if the one who had freed him bought him, the slave will be completely freed, otherwise, his liberation is invalid, except if the one who maintains his share of slavery, delivers him to his partner against a price, and then the one who had taken the initiative to free the slave, will totally free him posthumously. - Finally, about a Christian man, who had freed his slave, posthumously, after which the latter adopted Islam, Malek underlines: "It is forbidden for the Christian to enslave the slave, and the he will be given a certain income in exchange; therefore the slave will not be sold until the decision is taken by him in person. If the Christian dies, having a debt to pay, this will be subtracted from him from the price of the mudabbar, except if he had left property, which can cover the debt; thus, the mudabbar will be freed”. Chapter XI Injuries that the mudabbar causes to others.
(1549) 7 - It was reported to Malek that Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz judging about a mudabbar which caused an injury, said: "It is for its possessor to deliver it to the injured person who will make it work, or put it to his service, imposing on him compensation for his wounds. Thus, if the mudabbar manages to discharge, before his possessor dies, he returns to his home." - Malek said: "What is followed with us (at Medina) about the moudabbar which caused an injury, after which his master dies without his having any other property than the moudabbar in question, it is that he will be freed from the third, then we will divide the compensation in three parts, and will be discharged as follows: the first third will be calculated from the freed third of the slave, as for the other two thirds, they will return to the heirs who, if they wish, will deliver to the wounded their share against what the slave is entitled to them, namely two-thirds, or else, they will give him two-thirds of the compensation, thus retaining their share of the slave, inasmuch as the compensation for this injury belonged to the slave, and is not a debt due to the master. Thus, what had been committed by the slave will not invalidate what the master had already done, such as liberation and posthumous emancipation. If the master of the slave had a debt owed to people, and the slave has committed an offence, a part of the mudabbar will be sold corresponding to the compensation for the injury, and to the value of the debt; then one will debit by the payment of the compensation subtracting it from the price of the moudabbar, to which will follow the payment of the debt of the master; finally we will calculate what remains of the price in order to free the third of the slave, leaving the other two thirds, a share to the heirs. Moreover, we will act like this, because the offense committed by the slave has priority over the debt of the master, given that if the latter had died, leaving a moudabbar slave whose value is one hundred and fifty dinars , and that the latter had caused a serious injury to a man, worth compensation valued at fifty dinars, Malek explains thus: "We will pay, first of all, the fifty dinars, as compensation, which are at subtract from the price of the slave, then we will discharge the debt of the master, and we will finally calculate what remains of the price of the slave so that his third is freed, as for the other two thirds, they will be the share of the successors . Thus, the compensation of the slave is much more indebted than the debt of his master, and the debt is in turn in relation to the posthumous emancipation which in fact is only a will put in relation with one third of the property left by the deceased. Therefore, we do not tolerate anything from pothumous postage, as long as the master who intends to execute it, has a debt which he has not discharged, especially since the postage is a legacy, about which Allah Blessed and Most High has said (meaning): “...After his legacies or debts have been paid…” (Koran IV, 11). - And Malek to continue: "If it is that the third of the goods that left the death is enough for the complete emancipation of the moudabbar, it will be freed, and the compensation which it owes, will be a debt to him of which he will acquit himself after he has been freed, even if it is the price of the blood of a victim and his master will owe no debt”. About the moudabbar who injures a man which leads his master to hand him over to the injured, following which, the master dies with a debt to pay, and he leaves only the moudabbar as his property; and the heirs say, "We deliver it to the injured," and he to whom the debt is owed protests, saying, "What is owed to me is higher," Malek said, "If the creditor is owed a sum which is more than the value of the slave, he will have the precedence to enslave the slave, and there will then be a remission of the debt which is suitable to what has been added to the sum. But if the creditor has advanced no addition, he will not possess the slave”. - Finally concerning the mudabbar who owns property and causes a man an injury, and the master refuses to pay the compensation, the injured person, said Malek, will take money as compensation for his injury, if the amount suitable to cover it; once he has had his right to compensation for his injury, he must return the slave to his master. If the amount is not suitable, the injured person will recover it from the money possessed by the slave, and he will make him work until he has a complete acquittal of his compensation”. Chapter VII The oumm walad (mother (slave) of the child) who injures another.
(1550) 8 - Malek said: "In case an oumm walad injures someone it is his master who has the duty to pay compensation, unless what he will have to pay exceeds the price of his slave; in this case, he will only pay his price, as long as the master of the male or female slave, delivering one of them so that he pays the compensation, nothing more is imposed on him, if the compensation has a value greater than the price of the slave. If the master of the umm walad cannot deliver it, in accordance with the sunna, if he pays compensation corresponding to its value, it is as if he delivered it, and nothing more is imposed on him. . And, said Malek, that is the best I have heard, and the master will not have to take responsibility for the crime of his slave, if his value exceeds his price». MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Merciful The Merciful Book 41 The Book of Prescribed Punishments Chapter 1 Stoning
(1551) 1 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported: "Some Jews went to the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and told him that a Jew and a Jewess have committed adultery". The Apostle of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) asked them: "What do you find about stoning in your Torah"? And they answer: "To stigmatize them and flagellate them". Abdallah Ibn Salam answered them: “You are lying; for your Torah mentions stoning”. They brought the Torah, and opening it, one of them hid with his hand the verse where stoning is mentioned, then he read what precedes it and what follows it. Abdallah then said to him, "Push your hand", and the other doing so, the verse of stoning was found. So the Jews said: “It is true, O Muhammad, this verse exists there”. Then the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) ordered the stoning of the accused”. - And Abdallah Ibn Omar continues: "I saw the man bend over the woman in order to protect her against the stones". - And Malek explains: “The man leaned over the woman so that he alone received the stones”.
(1552) 2 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported: "A man from the Aslam tribe came to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and said to him: "The evil man (implying his own person) has committed adultery ; Abu Bakr asked him: “did you teach it to someone else”? “No, replied the other”, then Abu Bakr said to him: “Make your repentance to Allah, and do not reveal what Allah has hidden from you, for Allah accepts repentance from his servants”. But as the soul of this man was not appeased, he came to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab and took back from him what he had previously said to Abu Bakr; Omar speaking just like Abu Bakr, and because the man has not yet been appeased, he went to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and said to him: "The evil man has committed adultery"; And he did this three times Sa'id continued: "The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the mercy and peace of 'Allah) inquired of the parents of this man, inquired about him and asked: "Is he sick or insane"? They replied, “O Messenger of Allah! By Allah, he is safe and sound." The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) again asked: "Is he single or married"? - "Married, they answered him". Then the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered that he be stoned”.
(1553) 3 - Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab reported that he was told that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said to a man of the Aslam tribe, known as Hazzai: "O Hazzai, if you had covered him with your garment, it would be better for you" (namely, it was better if the man had not told the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah), what he had committed as an offence). Yahia Ibn Sa'id who reported this hadith, also said: "This hadith was told in an assembly where Yazid Ibn Nu'aim Ibn Hazzai Al-Aslami was, he said: "Hazai is my grandfather, and this hadith is right".
(1554) 4 - Ibn Chehab narrated that a man confessed to having committed adultery, at the time of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the mercy and peace of 'Allah) by giving his own testimony four times. The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered that this man be stoned”. Ibn Chehab said: "Such is the cause for which the prescribed penalty is applied to a man who has confessed to his crime".
(1555) 5 - Abdallah Ibn Abi Moulaika reported that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) telling him that she had committed the adultery while she was pregnant. Then, the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: “Go away, until you give birth”; once she gave birth she returned to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said to her: “Go home and nurse your little one”; the breastfeeding period being over, the woman returned to the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who said to her: "return home, and entrust your little one to a third person", the reporter says that the woman having done so, returned again to the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) who ordered her to be stoned ".
(1556) 6 - Abu Huraira and Zaid Ibn Khaled Al-Jouhani reported that two men took their disputes to the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) and the one of them said: “O Messenger of Allah, judge between us according to the Book of Allah”, and the other, who did not lack eloquence, said in turn: “Certainly yes, O Messenger of Allah. 'Allah, judge between us according to the Book of Allah, but first allow me to speak'. He says to him: “speak”. And the man continued: “My son was employed by this man, and committed adultery with his wife. So he told me that my son is to be stoned; I ransomed him for a hundred sheep and a slave girl that I owned, then I asked about it men versed in religion, who taught me that my son should be flogged a hundred times and exiled for a year, and it was the woman alone who was to be stoned". The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: “By him who holds my soul in His hand, I will judge your case according to the Book of Allah; as for your sheep and your slave, you will take them back", then he ordered that the son be whipped for a hundred times, and exiled for one year, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and the peace of Allah) ordered Ounais Al-Aslami, to go to the wife of the other, who confessed that she had committed adultery, and she was stoned.
(1557) 7 - Abu Huraira reported that Sa'id Ibn Ubada said to the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be the grace and peace of Allah): "What shall I do case where I find a man with my wife; should I leave it, so that I can find four witnesses”? “Yes, replied the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah)”.

Returning to Medina, he preached to the people saying: “Men! You have been given a Sunnah, and prescribed obligations, and everything is clarified to you, so don't mislead people”. Then clapping one hand over the other, he said: "Take care that you do not lose yourselves by neglecting the verse concerning stoning, and that one says: "There is not found in the Book of Allah a crime which is subject to two penalties. And the Apostle of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered the stoning and we did the same. By him who holds my soul in his hand, if I was not afraid that people would say: "Umar added a verse to the Book of Allah", I would have dictated it, namely: "Stone the man to death. and the middle-aged woman", because this verse, we had recited it". - Sa'id Ibn Al-Musaiab reported: and Zul-Hijja did not end that Omar was killed may Allah be merciful to him”. - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: “It was meant by the woman and the middle-aged man, those who are married. Having committed adultery, they are to be stoned”. - Note: to emphasize that the above verse is not quoted in The Book of Allah; but according to men versed in religion, it was revealed and then abrogated”.

A suitable whip was brought to him, he ordered the man to be whipped, then he said, “Men! It is already time for you to observe the punishments prescribed by Allah.

Thus, adds Malek: "If she has no proof, she is to submit to the prescribed sentence and we do not accept to take into account her statements". Malek said: “And the raped woman cannot marry until she has had three periods (thereby ensuring that she is not pregnant). And if during her period, she suspects that she is pregnant, she cannot marry until she has freed herself from this doubt”. Chapter V Libel, accusation of bastardy, and insinuations thereon.

Since the latter arrived late, his father said to him: “O fornicator!” Zuraiq continued: “The son asked that I support him, and wanted to whip the father, then the son cried: “By Allah! If you are going to whip him, I will confess to having committed adultery”; Now, when I said this to myself, I was embarrassed, and I wrote to Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz, who at that time was governor, telling him about this subject. Omar answered me: “To forgive the father”. “I wrote, Zouraiq continues, again to Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz, saying to him: “What do you say about a man who has been defamed or whose father and mother have been defamed when both are dead or one of them is alive” Omar answered me in writing: “If the one who is defamed forgives the other for his defamation, may his forgiveness be accepted; but for his parents, dead, or whether one of them is alive, and who have been defamed, apply the penalty prescribed according to the Book of Allah (namely eighty lashes), except if the defamed does not want to conceal himself”. - Malek said: “It is due to the fact that the defamed person risks being as he has been accused, and that obvious proofs are put forward about him. But if his case is such, he is forgiven, and even his forgiveness is acceptable”.
(1569) 20 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father said: "If a man defames a crowd of people, only one punishment is applied to him".

Asking Omar, to advise her, on this subject, a man exclaimed: "He only gave praise to his father and mother". Others replied, "He could return them in another way, so we find that he must be scourged." So Omar applied the prescribed sentence to him, namely eighty lashes. - And Malek adds: “The penalty prescribed is to be applied only for an accusation of bastardy, or a defamation or an insinuation of which the author wants by the latter only an accusation of bastardy or a defamation; thus the prescribed penalty must certainly be applied to him”. - Finally Malek said: "What is followed with us (in Medina), about a man accusing another of being a bastard, is to have to apply the penalty to him even if the mother of the defamed was a slave". Chapter VI The Cases Where Penalty Is Not Enforced (1570) - Malek said, "The best I have heard of a slave whom a man had cohabited, when he is partially owner of it, that he shall not be subject to the prescribed penalty; however the child will be assigned to her, and the slave will be valued the day she became pregnant; thus, one will give his partners their share, and the slave will be his belonging. This is what is followed with us (in Medina)”. - Regarding the man who allows another to live with his slave, Malek said: "If he had sex with her, we will assess the price of this slave, the same day he touched her, pregnant either it or not, and so he escapes the prescribed penalty. However, if she is pregnant, the child will be attributed to the man”. - Malek finally said about the man who had cohabited with the slave of his son or daughter, that he will not have to undergo the prescribed punishment; but the slave will be valued, pregnant or not, so that he pays his price”.
(1571) 22 - Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman reported that a man traveled in the company of a slave (female) of his wife and had sexual intercourse with her.

She sent with the two freedwomen a coat, on which was sewn a piece of green cloth. Amra continued and said, “Then the servant took the cloak, unstitched it and put in place of the green piece, wool and hair and then sewed it again. Once the two freedwomen arrived in Medina, they returned the coat to its owner, who unstitching it, found wool and hair instead of green fabric. The two freedwomen were questioned about this, and they reported it in writing to Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (upon him be Allah's grace and peace) and accused the servant. The latter questioned, confessed his crime, Aicha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered to cut off his hand and said: "We cut the hand of the thief, in case the price of the stolen object is a quarter of a dinar or more. - Malek said: "What is preferred to me is that the hand is cut off, in case the stolen object is of the price of three dirhams, even if the exchange price undergoes an increase or a decrease in it, therefore, the Apostle of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had ordered that the hand be cut off in case the shield is of a price of three dirhams. As for Osman Ibn Affan, he also demanded it for a citron whose price is three dirhams”. That's the best I've heard about it." Chapter VIII The Cutting of the Hand of the Maroon Slave and the Thief
(1577) 28 - Nafe' reported that a maroon slave belonging to Abdul-lah Ibn Umar, had stolen. Abdallah sent him to Sa'id ibn Al'As, who was then governor of Medina, to cut off his hand. Sa'id refused to do so and said, "The maroon slave's hand should not be cut off if he steals"; Abdallah Ibn Umar asked him: "In which passage of the Book of Allah, did you find this decision"? Thus, Abdallah Ibn Omar, ordered to bring the slave and cut off his hand”.
(1578) 29 - Malek reported that Zuraiq Ibn Hakim told him that he retained a maroon slave, while stealing. He continues: "Being embarrassed about him, I write to Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz, to get his opinion, even if he was governor at that time, telling him that I have heard that we do not have to cut the hand of a maroon slave, if he steals. Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz, replied to me in writing, where he quotes his completely opposite opinion, saying: "You made me learn in writing, that you heard it said, not to have to cut off the hand of a maroon slave s 'he steals. However Allah Blessed and Most High has said in His Book (meaning): “Cut off the hand of the thief and the thief: it will be a retribution for what they have committed and a punishment from Allah. Allah is mighty and just" (Qur'an Surah V, verse 38). Thus, if what is stolen by the maroon slave is of a price of a quarter of a dinar and more, to cut off his hand”. (...) 30 - It was reported to Malek that al-Kassem Ibn Muhammad, Salem Ibn Abdallah and Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair said: "If a maroon slave steals what deserves to have his hand cut off, cut him the him”. - And Malek to add: "this is what is indisputably followed among us (in Medina), namely that, if what a maroon slave steals, is of a price requiring that his hand be cut off, it is cut off for him ". Chapter IX No intercession about a thief if the matter is already with the Sultan
(1579) 31 - Safwan Ibn Abdallah Ibn Safwan reported that Safwan Ibn Umayya was told: “He who has not made the hijra is in trouble”.

He replied with a yes, the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) ordered to cut off his hand. So Safwan said to the Apostle of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah): “I did not want the matter to be such; this garment is an alms to him”.

(1581) 33 - Abdul Rahman Ibn Al Kassem reported from his father that a man from Yemen arrived, having his hand and foot amputated, and went down to Abu Bakr Al Siddiq, and accused the governor of Yemen who unfairly judged. This man spent the night praying when Abu Bakr said to himself: “By (the Lord) of your father, I find that a man who spends the night like this is not a thief”. Later, realizing that a necklace belonging to Asma Bint Oumaiss, wife of Abu Bakr Al Siddiq, was lost, the man with Abu Bakr's family set out to search for it, saying, "Great Allah ! It is up to You to punish the one who came to rob this virtuous house (implying that of Abu Bakr)”. The necklace was found at a jeweler who admitted that the amputee had sold it to him. The amputated man confessed his theft, or even testimony was brought against him. So Abu Bakr ordered his left hand to be cut off, saying, “By Allah! his invocation against himself was more painful to me than his theft”. - Malek said: "What is followed in Medina about the one who keeps stealing and against whom one asks for help, what one has only to cut off his hand, for all that he had stolen, if the prescribed punishment had not yet been applied to him. Now, if this penalty has been applied, and then he steals what requires that his hand be cut off, we must do it again for another member”.
(1582) 34 - Malek reported that Abu Al Zinad told him that a prefect of Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz had retained men, without them killing anyone (but for stealing). He wanted either to cut off their hands or to kill them; so he learned this in writing from Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz who answered him: "You will have to choose the lightest sentence to punish them". - Malek said: "What is followed in our country (in Medina) about the one who steals what people have displayed in the market, and whose owners have kept and collected objects well, we must cut off his hand if the stolen object is of a price which requires that the cut be made and that this be done day or night, although the owner is present with his objects or not”. - About the one who steals what requires the cutting of the hand, then that one finds on him the stolen object, and that one returns it to its owner, one always cuts his hand to him says Malek and continuing , he said: “If one challenges this by saying: 'How to cut off his hand, and that the stolen object has already been returned to its owner? “In fact, his case is like that of a drunkard who smells of wine without being drunk with it; thus one subjects it to the prescribed sorrow, answered Malek”. Thus, therefore, the drunkard is subject to the prescribed penalty who even if he drinks without becoming drunk, because he drank it only to be drunk. Likewise, the thief's hand is cut off for the object he has stolen even if he has not used it, and that it be returned to its owner; thus, the steering wheel, he intended to keep it». - Concerning the group of people who enter a house and rob it and then all come out, carrying together what they have found, namely, or a crate, or a stretcher or a basket or the like, which they bring out from their place where they are kept, and that the price of the stolen object requires that there be submission to the prescribed penalty, because it is three dirhams, their hands must be cut off". If each of them comes out with an object on him whose price is three dirhams or more, his hand will be cut off. As for the one, who steals an object of less than three dirhams, he will not have his hand cut off”. - And Malek to continue: "What is followed with us (in Medina) in the event that a man has a house where he lives alone, and that it is closed, is that we do not cut off the hand of the thief if he steals something from this house until after he has taken it out. But in case the house has several inhabitants, and each one closes his own door, the thief who steals something from this house, by taking it out, will have his hand cut off, because he has caused it to be moved from a guarded place. to another who is also guarded; so we have to cut off his hand”. - Malek to continue: "What is followed with us (in Medina), when a slave steals the effects of his master, and he is neither one of his servants, nor of those to whom one entrusts to keep the remains, but who, in secret, stole what requires, that one cuts off his hand, or does not cut it to him. It is the same for a slave, who steals the effects of her master: "As for the slave, who is neither servants, nor of those to whom one has entrusted to keep the house, and who steals the effects of his master's wife, which requires cutting off his hand, cutting off his hand". Likewise if it is a question of the slave of a woman, in case she is neither one of her servants, nor one of her husband, nor even of those to whom the house has been entrusted. , and she enters clandestinely, stealing the effects of her master's wife, her hand is not cut off if the thing stolen is of a value requiring it to be done". Such is also the case of the slave of a woman who is not one of her servants nor of those to whom the residence is entrusted, who enters clandestinely and steals her mistress's belongings, the value of which requires cutting, one does not don't cut off his hand." - Malek to add: the same for the man who steals his wife's belongings, or that the wife steals her husband's belongings, which requires that their hands be cut off, in case each of them has stolen the belongings of another, of a house which is other than that in which they live, their hand is cut off if the object stolen is of a value which requires it to be done”. - Malek to say again: “In case one steals, from a small child and from the mute, their effects, or what is in their houses, one cuts off the hand of the one who committed the theft. But if the child and the mute are outside their house, and they are stolen, one does not cut off the hand of the one who stole them. Besides, their case is similar to that of the fruits which are still on the tree or even of the herds lost in the mountains”. - Malek finally said: "What is followed in Medina, about the one who digs up the corpses, is to cut off his hand in case the object stolen is of a value requiring this penalty". Because, explains Malek: "The tomb is a sacred place just like the house, and where the penalty is only applied once the digger has brought out stolen objects from the tomb". Chapter XI What does not require the cutting of the hand.
(1583) 35 - Muhammad Ibn Yahia Ibn Habban reported that a slave stole a small palm tree from a garden belonging to a man, and planted it in his master's garden. The owner of this palm went out looking for his palm; finding it, he accused the slave to Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam who put him in prison, also wanting to cut off his hand. Immediately the master of the slave went in search of Rafé Ibn Khadij; asked him about it, he said that he heard the Apostle of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say: "One does not cut off the hand of the one who steals fruit from the tree, nor plans for a palm tree". Then the man said to Rafé: “Marwan Ibn Al Hakkam has retained one of my slaves and intends to cut off his hand; I would like you to come with me to tell him what you have heard from the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah). Rafé accompanies him to Marwan and asks him "Have you retained a slave who belongs to this man"? - "Yes, answered Marwan"; Rafé went on: "What do you want to do with him"? “Cut off his hand”; Rafé exclaimed: "I heard the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say: "One does not cut off the hand of the one who steals fruit on the tree, neither plans nor plans of palm tree". Marwan thus ordered that one releases the slave".
(1584) 36 - Al-Saib Ibn Yazid reported that Abdallah Ibn Amr Al-Hadrami, brought to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, his slave, and said, "Cut off my slave's hand, for he has stolen." Omar asks him: what did he steal”? The other replied: “A mirror of my wife, the price of which is sixty dirhams”. Omar then said, “Leave him; you must not apply the cut to it, because your slave has stolen an object from your effects”.
(1585) 37 - Ibn Chehab reported that Marwan Ibn Al Hakkam received a man who had stolen effects. Wanting to cut off his hand, he sent someone to Zaid Ibn Thabet to question him about it. Zaid Ibn Thabet replied, "A stolen object does not require the hand to be severed."
(1586) 38 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id related that Abu Bakr Ibn Muhammad Ibn amr Ibn Hazm reported to him that he arrested a Nabataean who stole iron rings. He held him back, so he could cut off his hand. Amra Bint Abdul Rahman sent him his slave called Umayya. Abu Bakr continued: “She came to my house, while I was among the men, and said to me: “Your maternal aunt Amra reports to you the following: “son of my sister! I was informed that you detained a Nabataean for having stolen a thing of little value, and you intended to cut off his hand”? - "Yes, I answered". «Amra, continues the slave - says to you: «The hand of the thief is not cut off except for having stolen an object whose price is a quarter of a dinar and more». Abu Bakr then said, "I have freed the Nabataean." - Malek said: "What is followed with us in Medina regarding the confession of slaves, in case one of them confesses his crime, it is that he is to submit to the prescribed penalty and to corporal punishment. Because his confession is tolerated, and he is not accused of having personally compromised himself to this penalty. “But, continues Malek, if one of them confesses his offense in such a way that the indemnity goes to his master, we cannot tolerate that his confession harms his master”. - Malek said again: “If an employee or another put in the service of people steals, one does not apply the penalty to them, because their case is not that of a thief, but rather of a treacherous and the treacherous is not subject to the cutting of the hand”. - Also Malek said: “Whoever borrows an aria (i.e. an object that is used and then returned) and denies it, will not have his hand cut off. For his case is like one who owes a debt to another and he denies it; but the denial does not require the cut”. - Malek to add: "What is followed in Medina, about a thief who, is in a house, where he has assembled the effects, but from where he has not yet left, it is that he is not subject to the penalty of the cut. For his case is like that of a man who had wine to drink in his hand; but not having drunk it, he is not subject to the prescribed penalty. Also, his case is similar to that of a man who finds himself seated with a woman, and who wants to cohabit her in an illicit way; however, having failed to do so, he is not subject to the prescribed penalty. - Finally Malek said: "what is followed in Medina is that stealth done stealthily does not require the cutting of the hand, whether or not the object stolen is of a value that requires it" . MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 42 The Book of Beverages Chapter 1 The penalty prescribed for drinking wine.
(1587) 1 - Ibn Chehab reported that Al-Saib Ibn Yazid told him that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had gone out, saying to them: "As I found that such and such smelled of wine, and he claimed that it was rather the smell of a broth; I ask you what he drank; but if it is a drink that gets drunk, I will whip it”. But being such, Omar whipped him”.
(1588) 2 - Thawr Ibn Zaid al-Daili reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab consulted men about who drinks wine (wanting to know what punishment to prescribe). Ali Ibn Abi Taleb said to him: “I find that he should be whipped eighty times, since if he drinks, he will be drunk; when drunk he will wander; and then he will lie and defame”. Thus Omar applied the penalty of eighty lashes to the wine drinker.
(1589) 3 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab was asked about the prescribed punishment to which a slave, drinking wine, is subjected. He replied, "I have been told that he is subject to the prescribed half sentence, in comparison to the free man who is completely subject to it". Also Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, Osman Ibn Affan and Abdallah Ibn Omar, had flogged their slaves who drank the wine, with forty lashes, namely, half a penalty”.
(1590) 4 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Mous-saiab say: "Allah loves to forgive all sins, except for what is subject to the prescribed penalty". Malek said, "It is Sunnah followed with us (in Medina), about one who drinks an intoxicating drink, whether or not becoming drunk, to be subject to the prescribed punishment."

I asked the men what he had said, and they replied: "He forbade the fermentation of drinks in gourds and skins coated with pitch."

Chapter IV Prohibition of wine
(1595) 9 - Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah ) when asked about the "Bita'" replied: "Any intoxicating drink is prohibited". (1) Bita': liqueur prepared from honey, by the Yemenis.
(1596) 10 - Ata Ibn Yassar reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) when asked about "Al-Ghoubaira", replied: "She is no good", and he forbade it. Malek said: “So I asked: Zaid-Ibn Aslam: “What is the Al Ghoubaira”? He answered me: “It is “Al-Ouskarka” (drink prepared from barley). (1) Ghoubaira: drink made from barley or rice.
(1597) 11 - Abdallah Ibn Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "He who devotes himself, in the life of here below, drinking wine, without repenting, he will not drink it in the life hereafter”. Chapter V The prohibition of intoxicating liquors in general.
(1598) 12 - Ibn Wa'la Al-Misri reported that he asked Ibn Abas about the juice of the grape, he replied: "a man had offered it to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's favor and peace) a skin of wine; the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: “Do you not know that Allah has forbidden it”?. "No," replied the man. Another man sitting next to him whispers to him in secret. The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) asked him: “What did you whisper to him”? To sell it, said the man. Then the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: "He who has forbidden it to be drunk, has also forbidden it for sale". The man thus opened the two skins and poured out their contents”.
(1599) 13 - Anas Ibn Malek reported: "I gave to drink, to Abou Oubaida Ibn Al-Jarrah, to Abou Talha Al-Ansari, and to Oubai Ibn Ka'b, a drink made of green and fresh dates". Anas continued and said, “a man came and told them: wine is forbidden”; Then Abu Talha said, “O Anas! Go smash those jars." Thus, says Anas: “I got up, took a trough and broke the bottom of the jars”.
(1600) 14 - Mahmoud Ibn Labib al-Ansari reported: “Once Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had arrived in Cham (Damascus), the inhabitants lamented the serious illness that had befallen the city, and said: “Nothing can restore us in good condition only this drink”; Omar said to them, "Drink honey"; they replied, “Honey does not suit us”; immediately one of them said to him: "Would you like this drink to be prepared for you, which does not intoxicate"? “Yes, answered Omar”. So they put it to boil, until two-thirds had evaporated, leaving only one-third, which they brought to Omar. He dipped a finger in it, then withdrew his hand, the liquid expanded. Omar said, "It's like the preparation with which camels are coated", and he ordered them to drink it. Then Oubada Ibn Al-Samett said to him: “By Allah! You have made it lawful”! And Omar continued: “No, by Allah! God is great! I will never make lawful for them what You have forbidden, nor will I forbid them what You have made lawful. (...) 15 - Abdallah Ibn Omar reported that men from Iraq said to him: "O Abu Abdul-Rahman, we bought ourselves dates and grapes, then we made wine from them and we were selling”. Then Abdallah Ibn Omar said to them: "I take as witnesses against you, Allah, His angels and all those who listen to geniuses and men, that I do not order you to sell it, nor to buy it, neither to squeeze it, nor to drink it, nor finally to give it to drink, because it is an abomination invented by Satan”. MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Merciful The Merciful Book 43 The Book of Blood Money Chapter I Blood Money
(1601) 1 - Muhammad Ibn Amr Ibn Hazm reported from his father that in the letter written by the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace), and sent to Amr, the following is emphasized: “For a stunned man, the price of blood is one hundred camels, and so is a completely amputated nose; for a head injury influencing the brain, one-third of the dyia, and likewise for an attacked stomach; for the eye, the hand, and the foot, each is fifty camels; for every amputated finger, ten camels; as for the pulled tooth and the wound reaching the bone, each is five camels”. Chapter II The Practice of Blood Money
(1602) 2 - It was reported to Malek that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab evaluated for the inhabitants of the villages, the price of blood at one thousand dinars in gold, or at twelve thousand dirhams in silver, and that, according to the current fund" . - Malek, explaining this says: “The current fund in Syria and Egypt is gold; and in Iraq, it's the money”. (...) 3 - Malek has heard that the blood money is to be paid over the course of three or four years. - And Malek to continue: “And it is preferable to me, that it is paid during three years”. - Finally Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina) is not to admit inhabitants of the villages, as blood money, camels; nor Bedouins, gold or silver; nor of those who possess gold, silver and vice versa”. (1) Note that this expression will, throughout this chapter, be taken to designate “murder”; as for the term "dyia", a word of Arabic origin, it will be taken in the sense of "legal compensation" paid as compensation for an offense committed. Chapter III The price of blood paid for a voluntary crime and of the crime committed by a madman.
(1603) 4 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab said: "In case the price of blood paid for a premeditated crime is admitted, it is twenty-five camels of one year old, twenty-five camels of two years of age, twenty-five camels of three years of age, and twenty-five camels of four years of age”.
(1604) 5 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Marwan Ibn Al-Hakkam wrote to Mu'awia Ibn Abi Sufian, asking his opinion about a mad man who killed another. Mou'awia answered him in writing: "impose the price of blood on him without killing him, because one does not subject a madman to the prescribed penalty". - Malek said: "About two men, one of whom is an adult and the other a youngster, and who kill together, in a premeditated way a man, it is up to the adult to be killed, and the youngest to pay half the blood money. - Finally Malek said: “The same applies to the case where two men, one free and the other a slave, together kill a slave; it is the slave who will be killed, as for the free man, he will have to pay half the price of blood». Chapter IV The price of blood paid for an involuntary crime.
(1605) 6 - 'Iraq Ibn Malek and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that a man from Bani Sa'd Ibn Laith, was running a horse, which crushed the finger of a man from Juhaina, who had a bleeding, and eventually die. Omar Ibn Al-Khattab said to the defendants: "Do you swear for fifty times in the name of Allah, that the man did not die because of this injury"? They refused and refrained from doing this, and on his part Omar addressing the others, asking them also, to swear, and they refused, he demanded that the first, namely the followers of Sa'd, pay half of the blood money to the victim”. - Malek said: “this was not followed at home (in Medina)”. (...) 7 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab, Suleiman Ibn Yassar and Rabi'a Ibn Abi Abdul Rahman, said: "The price of blood for a crime unintentionally committed is twenty camels of one year old , twenty camels two years old, twenty camels two years old, twenty camels three years old, and twenty camels four years old”. - Malek also said: “What is followed in our (in Medina) is not to subject young teenagers to the prescribed punishment, even if they willfully committed a crime, unless they are pubescent. Thus, a homicide committed by a boy is not considered intentional, since, if a boy and an adult man both unintentionally knocked out a free man, it falls to the "a'quila" of each of them. , to pay half the blood money”. (1) "the a'qila" constitutes all the males united by the legitimate bond of kinship, namely "agnate", inheriting the dead who can be either the father, or the uncle, or the brother, or the elder -father.... - Malek finally said: "Whoever knocks unintentionally, he will pay the price of blood without being subject to corporal punishment, because the price in question paid for the victim is just like what he has property from which he can discharge a debt or even make a bequest. Thus, if he has property, the blood money to be paid will be a third of it, and thus he is exempt from the diya, although this is tolerated for him. And if he has no assets, except what is blood money, also this is tolerated for him to take the third to make a legacy and an exemption if the parents of the victim forgive him. Chapter V Blood money suitable for wounds caused unintentionally;
(1606) 8 - Malek said: "What is followed with us (in Medina), concerning wounds caused involuntarily, is that blood money is not to be paid until the injured person has healed . Again, if it is a fracture in the hand or in the foot, or other member of the body of the man, involuntarily caused, then that it is healed, returning to its initial state, there is no a price to pay, but if this wound has caused a deformation or an ugliness, the price of the blood which is to be paid must be proportional to what has been deformed and ugly”. - And Malek to continue: "If it is a question of a fracture of the bones, of which the Prophet r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) had specified the price of the blood which is suitable for him, it must be in conformity with the prescriptions of the Prophet; but if it is that the Prophet (on him the grace and the peace of Allah) did not specify the price of blood, and that there is on this subject neither a sunnah nor a fixed price , we are trying to give a suitable sentence”. - Malek also said: “scars caused by mistake, to the body unintentionally, do not require blood money, if the scar becomes healthy, returning to its original state. But, if the citratress leaves a deformation or a disfigurement, we consider what is suitable for her as a diya, except if it is a "jaifa", which requires that the dyia be a third of that of a murder. Nor is there, continues Malek, a dyia for the case of a "mounakkila"^ which is just like "the moudiha"^. - Malek finally said: “What is followed with us (in Medina), in case a doctor in circumcising has the glans of the penis cut off, is that this imposes a dyia on him. And this is one of the errors that la'aqila must assume in his responsibilities. It is the same for any error committed by a doctor, or that he goes beyond his duties, without his wanting it; if so, the dyia is payable'. Chapter VI The Price of Woman's Blood.
(1607) 9 - Yahia ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: "The price of a woman's blood is one third of that of a man, but the dyia is the same if he acts of an amputated finger or a broken tooth, or even of the same wounds known as moudiha and mounakkila”. (...) 10 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab and Ourwa Ibn al Zoubair said similarly to Sa'id Ibn Al Musaiab about the price of a woman's blood, namely that it is one third of that of man. And if this price already reaches a third, the dyia will be half that of the man”. Interpreting this, Malek said, “So for the wounds called the 'moudiha' and the 'mounakkila', the dyia is the same as that of man; but as regards the “jaifa” and the “ma'mouma”, and other similar wounds, subject to a third of the price of blood, the dyia of the woman will be half that of the man”. (...) 11 - Malek reported that he heard Ibn Chehab say: "It is Sunnah that a man causing an injury to his wife, that he pay her the dyia suitable for this injury , without being subject to the prescribed penalty”. - Malek also said: "But it is such in case this wound is involuntarily caused by the man, by hitting his wife with a whip and by gouging out her eye for example". (1) “jaifa”: it is a wound reaching inside the body. (2) “mounakkila”: an injury with dislocation. (3) “moudiha”: an injury without a fracture. (4) “la m'amouma”: this is a fracture of the head reaching the skull. - Malek finally said: “Regarding the woman who has a husband and children who are neither of her acebs nor of her people, her husband, especially if he is from another tribe, will not have to pay blood money in the event of an offence, neither with regard to this woman, nor with regard to his children who are not of his own tribe, nor even with regard to his uterine brothers who do not are neither of her "acebs" nor of her people, for they have a right to the inheritance of this woman. As for the relatives, they had, and from the time of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah), to pay the price of blood, until our days. It is the same for the freedmen of the woman whose inheritance goes to the children of the woman even if they are not of her tribe. And the price of the blood of a crime unwittingly committed by the freedmen, will have to be paid by the tribe of the woman”. (2) “the aceb”: is the male who inherits from a dead, the remainder of the inheritance, after the reserveees have had their share; or who inherits everything if there are no reservers. Chapter VII The price of the blood of the fetus.
(1608) 12 - Abu Huraira reported that two women from the Hazil tribe, quarreled, during which one caused the other who was pregnant, to lose her child. Thus, the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) demanded, “the ghourra” (as compensation) which is either a slave or a slave”.
(1609) 13 - Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: "The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) demanded, concerning the child killed in the bosom of his mother, "the ghourra" as lawful compensation and who is a slave. The man who owed this compensation, a Protestant, said: “How shall I pay the price of a being who has not yet drunk, eaten, spoken, or spoken; thus such a requirement is invalid”. However, the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) replied: “This man is a colleague of magicians”. (....) 14- Malek reported that Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman said: “The ghourra is valued at fifty dinars or six hundred dirhams; and the dyia of a free Muslim woman is five hundred dinars or even six thousand dirhams”. - Malek said: “The licit compensation of a child killed in the bosom of his mother, a free woman, is equivalent to one tenth of his dyia; and the tenth is fifty dinars or six hundred dirhams”. - And Malek to continue: "I have not heard anyone say that for a child killed in the bosom of its mother, one should only pay a ghourra until the moment when its mother has aborted it or even that 'he falls dead'. - “And always, on this subject, Malek said: “I heard that if the child leaves the bosom of its mother alive, then that it dies, there still one requires a complete compensation”. - “Also Malek adds: “A child is only considered alive when he comes out of his mother's lap. Thus, if he leaves there and dies afterwards, the compensation is due. I also believe that the compensation of a child of a slave is a tenth of the price of his mother”. - Finally Malek said: “If a pregnant woman kills a man or a woman involuntarily, she will not be subjected to the prescribed penalty, until she has given birth to her fetus. If a pregnant woman is voluntarily or involuntarily killed, the one who killed her will have nothing to pay to kill her fetus. But if she is voluntarily killed, the one who killed her is killed, without his having to pay any compensation with regard to her fetus. Finally, if the woman is killed involuntarily, it is up to the aquila of the murderer to pay the price of the blood of the mother, independently of her fetus”. (...) 15 - Malek was asked about the child of a Jewish or Christian woman, if it is aborted, he replied: "I think we have to pay him the tenth of the price of the his mother's blood. Chapter VIII What is subject to full dyia.
(1610) 16 - Ibn Chehab reported that Sa'id Al Moussaiab said: “For the two cut lips, one owes a full dyia; but if it is only the lower lip, the dyia is two-thirds”. (...) 17 - Malek reported that he asked Ibn Chehab about the one-eyed man putting out the eye of a healthy man? Ibn Chehab answered: “If the healthy desires that the punishment be applied to the one-eyed, this is his right; or he may have a dyia of one thousand dinars or twelve thousand dirhams”. (...) 18 - It was reported to Malek that for every lost pair of a man's limbs, there must be a complete dyia; so is the tongue, both ears with deafness, whether even cut off or not; also one needs a complete dyia for the penis of the man and the two testicles» (...) 19 - It was still reported to Malek, that the dyia must be complete for the two breasts cut off from a woman» . - Malek, on the other hand, said, “I think there is no dyia about cropped eyebrows, nor about the man's chest either.” - Finally Malek said, “What is followed with us (in Medina) is to give the man a full dyia in case he has lost much more than a limb. Also, if it is his hands, his feet and his eyes which are affected, to know that he is broken and punctured, he is entitled to three dyia”. “As for the healthy eye of a one-eyed man, who by mistake is punctured, he will be entitled to a complete dyia”. Chapter IX The dyia poured out about the eye losing sight
(1611) 20 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that Zaid Ibn Thabet said: “For the healthy eye that has lost sight, it takes a dyia of one hundred dinars”. - Malek was asked about the loss of the lower lid of the eye, and the fracture of its socket; he answered: "one does not fail to find a suitable sentence, except if this harms the sight of the eye, then one considers what is harmful". - Eventually Malek said, "What is followed with us (in Medina), about a blind eye, if it is torn out, and the same for a paralyzed hand which is cut off. It is that he does not There is only a suitable sentence to put forward, without there being a precise dyia about it. Chapter X The dyia corresponding to wounds
(1612) 21 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id heard Sulaiman Ibn Yassar say: "the moudiha" on the face is treated similarly to that which is made on the head, except if it disfigures the face; then thus, one adds his dyia, taking into account the difference between this one, and half of the dyia corresponding to the head and it will be seventy-five dinars. - Malek said: “What is followed in Medina regarding the “mounakkila” is to give fifteen camels as a dyia. "The mounakkila", continues Malek, is the wound which causes the fine bones of the head to be lost without reaching the brain; it can be in the head as well as in the face”. - Malek to also say: "what is followed in Medina, about the "maamouma" and the "Jaifa", is that they do not impose the prescribed sentence on me". And Ibn Chehab said: "the maamouma does not require pain". - And Malek interpreting said: “the maamouma is a fracture penetrating the bones of the skull; and it is only considered as such”. - Finally Malek said: “What is followed in Medina is that there is no need to pay a dyia for a wound which is less than the moudiha; in fact the dyia is with regard to the mudiha and a greater wound, because the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had underlined it in his letter sent to Amr Ibn Hazm, where he matched it with five camels. Moreover, the imams of the past and of today have not demanded anything like dyia about the moudiha”. (...) 22 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: "Any deep wound practiced in one of the limbs, requires a dyia equivalent to one third of that of this limb ". (...) 23 - Malek said: “Ibn Chehab was not of the opinion (quoted above); as for me, I did not find that we agreed on the subject of the deep wound practiced in one of the members, but rather it is up to the imam to find a suitable sentence”. - Also Malek said: “What is applied in Medina is to consider an injury as a maamouma or mounakkila or even moudiha, only if it is in the face or in the head. But any other injury made in any part of the body, calls only for a sentence”. - Finally Malek said: "I do not conceive, as regards the lower jaw and the nose, to consider them as part of the head, as long as they are separated from it, and that the head is him, a single bone”. (...) 24 - Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman reported that Abdallah Ibn Al Zoubair had applied the law of retaliation to a man who caused munakkila”. Chapter XI The dyia corresponding to the fingers.
(1613) 25 - Rabi'a Ibn Abdul Rahman reported: “I asked Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab about the dyia for the cut finger of a woman? He answered me: “It is ten camels” “And for two fingers, I resumed”? “Twenty camels, he replied” “And for three”? - “Thirty camels”; “and for four”? - “twenty camels”. So I asked him: “How is it that the more serious the injury, the more the dyia decreases”? Sa'id replied, “Are you Iraqi? - "Actually a scholar with a fine mind, or an ignoramus to learn, I replied". Sa'id to reply, "Rather, he is of the Sunnah, O son of my brother." (1) Iraqi: designates the one who applies the reasoning by Syllogism. - Malek also said: “What is followed in Medina is to demand dyia in case the finger of a hand is cut off. If it is the five cut off, their dyia will be that of a complete hand, namely fifty camels, starting with ten camels for each finger”. - Finally Malek said: “for the phalanxes of the hand, the required dyia is thirty-three dinars, and a third for each of them, corresponding thus, to three camels and to a third of the camel”. Chapter XII The dyia relating to the teeth.
(1614) 26 - Aslam, the freedman of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab reported that Omar demanded that the dyia of a tooth, be a camel, as well as for the collarbone and the rib». l (...) 27 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that he heard Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab say: “Omar Ibn Khattab demanded that the dyia be, for every tooth pulled out, a camel ; and Mu'awia (for his part, let the dyia be five camels for every tooth pulled out." - Sa'id, continued, and said: "So then the dyia is decreasing according to Omar, and increasing according to Mu'awia As for me, if I had to make up my mind, I would have imposed two camels for each tooth pulled out, finding that such a dyia is so suitable, and every jurist will be rewarded for it”.(....) 28 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab said: "in case the tooth is affected and as a result blackens, the dyia is payable. And if, after blackening. it is torn out , the dyia will be paid, in full.” [Chapter XIII The application of the dyia of the teeth.
(1615) 29 - Abu Ghatafan Ibn Tarif Al-Mourri reported that Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam sent him, to ask Abdallah Ibn Al-Abas, about the unintentional pulling out of a tooth”? Abdallah Ibn AI Abbas replied, "The dyia paid is five camels." Marwan instructed me to be again at Abdallah Ibn Abbas asking him “Do you consider the molars as the incisors”?. And Abdallah Ibn Abbas to answer: “don't the fingers of a hand require the same dyia”? (...) 30 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported that his father did not distinguish between the teeth, when it is about the dyia». * Malek said: “What is followed with us (in Medina) is that the dyia is the same for all the teeth at once, is it the inolars or the incisors, because the Envoy of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "for a tooth-involuntarily pulled out - the dyia is five camels, and the molar is none other than one tooth among others, where they cannot be distinguished from each other”. Chapter XIV The dyia paid for the injury caused to a slave.
(1616) 31 - It was reported to Malek that Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar said: "the slave's moudiha requires a dyia worth half of the tenth of its price". (...) 32 - It was also reported to Malek that Marwan Ibn Al Hakkam decided about the slave who was injured, that it is the duty of the one who injured, to give the payment of a dyia equivalent to what is the decrease in the price of the slave”. * Malek said: "What is followed with us (in Medina) is that the dyia paid for the injury caused to a slave, depends on the nature of the latter, just like what follows: * for the moudiha, a dyia worth one tenth of half the price of the slave. * for the mounakkila, it is one tenth and half of a tenth. * for the maamouma and the jaifa: each is a third of its price. As for other wounds, namely anything that can diminish the price of the slave, it is estimated, after the healing of the slave, how much is the difference, between the value of the price of the slave after his wound, and his value before he suffered it. Then one asks to the author of the wound the payment of a dyia equivalent to the difference of the two prices”. - Also, about the slave whose hand or foot was fractured, after which the limb healed, Malek said: "In fact, whoever caused this fracture, will not have to pay anything, except if this fracture causes the reduction of the price of the slave, or even his dislocation then thus, the dyia to be paid will be equivalent to the reduction of the price”. - And Malek to continue: "what is followed in Medina is that the law of retaliation is applied to both slaves and free men, namely: a slave can be killed for a slave, their wounds are still the same . Also, if a slave voluntarily kills another slave, the master of the latter will have to choose: either that he applies the law of retaliation to the slave, or that he has to recover the dyia, equivalent to the price of his slave kill. On the other hand, if the master of the homicidal slave wants to pay the price of the killed slave, he will be able to do so, or he will deliver his slave to the master of the murderer slave and again the other master having already the murderous slave, will not have to kill him. Such is the rule followed between slaves even in the case where it is a question of a hand or a foot being cut off or of another penalty such as murder which is also subject to the law of retaliation”. - Malek finally said about the Muslim slave, hurting a Jew or a Christian, that the master of this slave can pay him the dyia for his doing, or he can deliver him to be sold. Being such, one gives to the Jew or to the Christian, a dyia coming from the price of the slave, or still all the price so that the dyia is paid; but neither a Jew nor a Christian will be handed over a Muslim slave”. Chapter XV The dyia of the People of the Book.
(1617) 33 - It was reported to Malek that Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz has decided, in case a Jew or a Christian is killed, that Sa dyia of each, be equivalent to half that of a free Muslim man", - Malek said, "What is followed among us (in Medina) is not to kill a Muslim because of a disbeliever, unless the Muslim kills the other out of treason; therefore he will be subject to 'execution". (...) 34 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Soulaiman Ibn Yassar said: «The dyia of a "majous" (one of the Magi) is eight hundred dirhams». And Malek to underline: “This is also what is followed with us (in Medina)”. - Finally Malek said: “The wounds caused to Jews, Christians, and Magi have a relatively small dyia compared to the wounds of Muslims, which is as follows: For the moudiha, it is half of the tenth of the dyia (of the Muslims ); for the maamouma and the jaifa: each is a third party, and so it is with all their wounds”. Chapter XVI What is subject to the dyia of a man's property.
(1618) 35 - Hisham Ibn Ourwa reported from his father, that he said: “The aqila is not subject to the payment of blood money, when it is a crime voluntarily committed; but this price is to be paid, if the crime is involuntary”. (...) 36 - Malek reported that Ibn Chehab said: "It is Sunnah no longer to require the aquila to pay the blood money of a voluntary crime unless she is willing to do so. make". (...) 37 - Malek added, that Yahia Ibn Sa'id was of the same opinion (quoted above). -And Malek to continue that Ibn Chehab said: "It is Sunnah, in case it is a voluntary murder, and where the relatives of the victim have withdrawn, that the dyia be paid from their own property of the murderer, unless the aqila intends to support him to fulfill his will". - Malek also said: “what is followed in Medina is that the dyia is not obligated to pay it, except in the case where the dyia is one third and beyond; being such, it is required of the aqila; if it is less than one-third, the dyia is paid from the author's own money”. - Malek added: “What is unquestionably followed in Medina regarding who, one accepts the payment of a dyia, for committing willful murder or even for willfully causing injury, and where the relatives of the victim accepted the dyia is that nothing is required of the aqila unless it does so willingly; for in fact the price of blood, is to be paid from the own money of the murderer or of the one who caused the wound, if he possesses the money; otherwise, this remains a debt, which he will have to discharge; therefore, the aqila will not have to pay anything unless she wishes”. - Malek said again: “Nothing is required of the aqila, in case a man kills or injures himself voluntarily or involuntarily; moreover, such is the opinion of men versed in religion on this subject. And I have never heard anyone say that the aqila must guarantee the dyia of a voluntary crime. This is known from the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in His Book (meaning): "One should use proper treatment towards the one to whom his brother has forgiven part of the debt, and he himself will indemnify him in the best way” (Koran II, 178). This is interpreted as follows, and Allah is most knowledgeable: "Whoever takes part of his brother's dyia, let him follow him with a suitable deed, and let the doer kindly compensate him." - "Regarding the boy or the woman, committing a crime whose dyia is not beyond one-third of the blood money, and both of them do not possess the money which is necessary for them, Malek said: "In fact , this must be secured from their own property, whence one takes the sum; but if neither of them has the money, the blood money will be a debt they will have to pay, without the aqila having anything to do with it. On the other hand, the father of the boy will not have to pay what is the duty of this boy”. - Finally Malek said: “What is unquestionably followed with us (in Medina), regarding the killed slave, is that his dyia is to be assessed on the very day of his murder. As for the murderer's aqila, it will owe nothing of this dyia of any value, namely less or more. Because it is up to the murderer to compensate with his own money as much as the dyia will be. On the other hand, if the price of the slave is equivalent to the dyia or whether it is higher or lower than it, it will be taken from the money of the murderer, as long as the slave is considered as a commodity among d 'others". Chapter XVII The legacy of the dyia and its execution.
(1619) 38 - Ibn Chehab reported that Umar Ibn Al-Khattab, when he was in Mina, addressed the people saying: "Whoever has knowledge about the dyia, let him tell me 'learn'. Al-Dahhak Ibn Sufian arose and said: "The Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) urged me in writing to inherit the wife of Achiam al- Dibabi her share of her husband's dyia'. Omar said to him: "Enter your tent and await my arrival". As soon as Omar showed up, Al-Dahhak teaches him what is the subject of the dyia; from then on, Omar decided on the business of the dyia. - And Ibn Chehab added: "The murder of Achiam was accomplished involuntarily".
(1620) 39 - Amr Ibn Chou'aib reported that a man from Bani Moudiej known as Katada, throwing his sword at his son, hit him on his leg, after which, the son died due to a hemorrhage. Souraqa Ibn Jou'choum, went to Omar Ibn Al Khattab, told him the incident, Omar, also said to him: "go to "Qadid", count one hundred and twenty camels and wait for me to arrive". Omar Ibn Al-Khattab arrived at the destined place, took camels counted, thirty camels of three years old, thirty camels of four years old and thirty more full, then said: “where is the brother of the knocked down”? "Here I am," he replied. - Take them”, continued Omar, because the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) said: “a homicide has no right to dyia” . (...) 40 - Malek reported that Sa'id Al Moussaiab and Soulaiman Ibn Yassar were asked, if the dyia was to increase, if it falls during a holy month? "No," they replied, but it is added out of consideration to this month." Then Sa'id was asked: "Should the dyia corresponding to wounds be increased, just like that which is increased for murder"? "Yes," he said. - Malek added: “I see that they have, on this subject, acted, just as Omar Ibn Al-Khattab had judged the affair of the dyia of Moudlaji, throwing his sword and wounding his son”.
(1621) 41 - Ourwa Ibn Al-Zoubair reported that a man from the Ansai known as Ouhaiha Ibn Al-Joulah had an uncle who was shorter than him, living with his maternal uncles; Ouhaiha took him and killed him; thus the maternal uncles exclaimed, "we brought him up from his tender age, and once he became a robust man, a paternal nephew took him away from us." Ourwa then said: “it is for such a reason that a murderer does not inherit from his victim”. - Malek said: “What is unquestionably followed among us (in Medina) is that the murderer who kills willfully, inherits nothing from the dyia of the victim, nor from his property. Also, this murderer cannot prevent any reservator from receiving his share of the estate. And the one who, involuntarily, kills, still inherits nothing from the dyia. However, regarding his right to inheritance, this has been subject to discussion, as long as he is not accused of having killed, to inherit the victim, nor to seize his property. Thus, what I find good is that he will have to inherit his property, independently of his dyia”. Chapter XVIII The dyia in general.
(1622) 42 - Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said: "No more dyia to be returned in case of an accident from animal, well and metal. As for what is “rikaz” (it is what is buried treasures in pre-Islamic times) we count the fifth”. - Malek, on this subject, is of the same opinion. - Malek said: "The leader of a caravan, the driver of a beast and the one who rides it, all are responsible for the wounds caused by a mount, except the case where the beast kicks without it being pushed by someone who makes him do that. On the other hand, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, was for the payment of the dyia concerning the one who makes his mount run (ie thereby causing him an injury). - Malek added: “Besides the leader of a caravan, the driver of a beast and the one who rides it owes much more the payment of a dyia than the one who makes his mount run”. - Malek said again: "What is practiced in Medina, is the following: "Whoever digs a well in the middle of the street, or that he attaches a mount or even that he does the like thing on the path traveled by Muslims, and that all these actions are what is not permitted, and what causes harm to Muslims, he will be held to bear the responsibility for what may happen, injury be it or otherwise. If the damage caused does not count even a third of the dyia, it will be taken from that man's own money; but if the sum is one-third or more, it is aqila. However if the man had done what is permitted as an action, and this had caused damage or harm to the Muslims, he will not be responsible for it, such as digging a well to retain rain water. or get off a mount and tie it up beside the road, to satisfy a need”. - Also, about the one who descends into a well, and another follows him, in such a way that the first attracts the second, both ending up in the well, Malek said: "It is at the first of pay the dyia”. - The same for the boy, to whom the man asks to go down in a well, or to climb a palm tree, and who ends up dying (by making a fall or another cause related to this order), Malek said: “C 'is up to the man to take responsibility, thus paying the dyia'. - Malek said again: "What is unquestionably practiced among us (in Medina) is to demand from women and boys the payment of the dyia with raqua, because in fact the dyia is payable only from qm men are already mature”. -About the dyia demanded of freedmen Malek said: “We can charge the aquila with them if she accepts but in case she refuses they will belong to Diwan (1), or be abandoned. Also in the time of the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) and Abu Bakr Al Siddiq, the aqila regime was followed even before the diwan n existed; therefore this diwan was instituted in the time of Umar. Therefore, it is not permissible for someone to be paid the dyia if they are not people of his tribe or his relatives, because the wala cannot be transmitted, although the Messenger of Allah r (salallahou alayhi wa salam) On him the grace and peace of Allah said: "the right of patronage (in other words the wala) belongs to the one who frees". (1) The Diwan is designed as the register. But during the time of Omar Ibn el Khattab the Diwan was made up of governmental and official institutions such as the public treasury, personal status and others... - And Malek to emphasize the wala is a fixed membership " - - Also, what is followed in us (in Medina) concerning beasts that have suffered harm; Malek said, "Whoever has caused harm to them, must pay for them a sum equivalent to the rate of diminution." - Concerning the man condemned to death, by committing a crime which subjects him to a prescribed sentence, Malek said: "The prescribed sentence is no longer taken into account, as long as death is all-encompassing, except if it is the case of defamation, so we ask the defamed: "Why don't you ask for the application of the penalty to the one who defamed you"? And Malek to underline: “I conceive there, the application of the prescribed penalty to the defamer before killing him. Then we will kill him, I do not understand that we have the right to impose the payment of the dyia on him if it is an injury for example, because the death penalty does not leave room for any other penalty. . - Malek said again: “What is followed with us (in Medina), about a man killed, abandoned among the dwellings or in a village or other place. It is that one does not have the right to accuse the one whose house is close to the killed, nor the one who lives very close to the place where you were abandoned killed, because it is possible that a man is killed and then kicked people out to be charged. Thus such an act is to be rejected”. - Finally, about a group of people who fight among themselves, and end up with one killed or one injured without it being possible to know who is responsible for it, Malek said: "What I have of best heard to say about it is to demand the dyia of those who fought against him; and if the wounded or the killed was neither from one camp nor from another, the dyia will be demanded of both camps at the same time”. Chapter XIX Murder Committed by Treason or by Magic.
(1623) 43 - Sa'id Ibn Al Moussaiab reported that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab ordered to kill five or seven people who treacherously knocked out a man, and he said: "if all the inhabitants of Sana'a ( town in Yaman where the crime took place) had conspired for his murder, I would have ordered them all to be killed at once".
(1624) 44 - It was reported to Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Rahman Ibn Sa'd Ibn Zarara that Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet (Upon him be Allah's Grace and Peace) had ordered to kill one of her slaves whom she had already freed posthumously, for having bewitched her". - Malek said: "The magician practicing sorcery, without being bewitched by another (killing another by his magic) is to be compared to the man about whom Allah said in his Book (the meaning ): "Men know that he who acquires these vanities will have no part in the future life" (Koran 11,102). Therefore, he must be killed if he committed the murder himself”. Chapter XX Voluntary crime
(1625) 45 - Omar Ibn Houssein, the freedman of Aicha Bint Koudama, told that Abdul-Malek Ibn Marwan had delivered a man who had killed another with a stick to the defender of the victim who, him, killed the culprit with a stick”. - Malek said: “The unquestionably followed standard among us (in Medina) is: “In case a man strikes another with a stick or throws a stone at him or even hits him voluntarily, and the man dies, such is the voluntary crime subject to the law of retaliation”. - Malek added: “thus, the crime considered voluntary among us (in Medina), is that a man strikes another until he dies; on the other hand, it is still a voluntary crime, the fact that a man strikes another because of animosity or even as a result of a quarrel, and then leaves him still alive. However, if the latter dies following a haemorrhage, one will have recourse to the “Kaça-ma” (cf following Chapter). - Malek finally said, "What we follow at home (in Medina) is that in the course of willful murder, guilty free men are killed by a single free man, women by a single woman, and slaves by one slave”. Chapter XXI The law of retaliation applied to a murder
(1626) 46 - It was reported to Malek that Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam had sent in writing to Mu'awia Ibn Abi Sufian that a drunken man had been brought to him, who killed a man. On this subject, Moua'wia answered him "Make him killed". - Malek said: “The best I heard about the explanation of this verse (the meaning): “The free man for the free man, the slave for the slave“, (Quran II, 178), such are the males, and “the free woman for the free woman”, it is that the application of the law of retaliation is the same, as much to women as to men. Thus, one kills a free woman for a free woman, just as one kills the free man for a free man, still one kills the male or female slave, for a male or female slave. So the law of retaliation is applied in the same way to women as well as to men, in accordance with the words of Allah Blessed and Most High in his book (meaning): "We have prescribed for them, in the Torah: life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth. Wounds fall under the law of retaliation” (Koran V,45). Thus, Allah Blessed and Most High had mentioned that life is for life, meaning that a free woman can be killed by a free man, and her wounds are like his, subject to the law of retaliation”. - Concerning the man who holds for another, a man so that the second strikes the third and kills him on the spot, Malek said: “If the first holds the third, so that the second can kill the latter, it is necessary that both are killed. But if he holds him believing that the second wishes to strike the third, thereby wishing to reform him, without his seeking to kill him, the murderer must be killed; as for the one who held the victim, he will be severely judged and imprisoned for one year without being condemned to death”. - Concerning the man who voluntarily kills another or gouges out his eye, after which the murderer will be killed, or his eye will be gouged out, before the law of retaliation is applied to him, Malek said: "He will not will neither pay a dyia nor be subject to the law of retaliation, because he who has been killed or whose eye has been gouged out, had the right to apply a similar sanction to one who has voluntarily killed. Because in fact he is in the same situation as that of a man who voluntarily kills, then dies. Thus, given that the murderer is dead, the relatives of the victim will not be entitled to a dyia, nor to any other legal compensation, and this by reference to what Allah Blessed and Most High has said in His Book: " the law of retaliation is prescribed for you in case of murder: the free man for the free man, the slave for the slave” (Koran 11,178). - Explaining this, Malek said: “Thus then, the victim has the full right to apply to the murderer the law of retaliation; but if the murderer dies, the victim will have neither blood money nor an application of the law of retaliation”. - Finally Malek said: “the law of retaliation is not to be applied to a free man wounding a slave; but if a slave voluntarily kills a free man, he will be killed; as for the free man killing a slave, he will not be killed even if the crime is voluntary. And that's the best I've heard." Chapter XXII Pardon for a Voluntary Crime
(1627) 47 - Yahia reported that Malek had come across men versed in religion and approved of him, saying, "If a murdered man recommends (before he dies), to pardon his murderer who killed him willfully, that he is allowed, because he had more right than the others, to dispose of the person of the murderer (namely either to condemn him to death or to pardon him). - Concerning a murdered man, who forgives, before dying to his murderer who killed him voluntarily, once sentenced to death, Malek said: “The victim no longer has the right to blood money, except that he asks him for it, granting him forgiveness". - And Malek to continue: If the willful killer is pardoned, he will be flogged for a hundred lashes, and will be imprisoned for a year. - When a man voluntarily kills another, and this is already in evidence, while the victim has sons and daughters, if the sons forgive the killer and the daughters refuse him, this forgiveness is valid as long as it is more considered than that of girls; therefore the girls will have no right to claim either forgiveness or blood money”. Chapter XXIII The application of the law of retaliation, about wounds. (1628) - Malek said: "What is unquestionably followed among us (in Mcdine), in regard to one who willfully causes a fracture in the hand or foot of a man, is to apply to him the law of retaliation-without claiming dyia". - Also Malek said: "The law of retaliation will only be applied to the culprit if the wounds are healed- If the wound caused to the culprit is similar to that of the attacked once cured, such will be worth it; in case the wound is more grawc, or else the culprit is dead, the assailed owes nothing to the culprit-If the assailed becomes paralyzed or his wounds have healed leaving a bodily defect or deformity or dislocation , while the aggressor is completely healed, he will not have the right to have the culprit broken, the other hand, or to have a penalty applied to him. However one pays, by compensation the dyia which must be equivalent to that dislocation; and wounds will be treated the same as broken bones”. -Malek said if a man voluntarily gouges his wife's eye, or breaks her hand or cuts off her finger, or does a similar wrong to her, he will be subject to the law of retaliation. As for the man who hits his wife with a rope or a whip, thus causing her any harm whatsoever involuntarily, he will pay the dyia without being subject to the law of retaliation”. (...)"-Malek finally said it was reported to me that Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Amer ibn Hazm had decided to apply the retaliation far for a broken thigh"- Chapter XXIV What is suitable like dyia to 'Al Sa'iba' and the crime he commits
(1629) 49 - Soulaiman Ibn Yassar reported that a pilgrim had freed his esdave as Sa'iba, this one killed a man of Bani 'Aez. The father of the victim comes to find Omar Ibn AI-Khattab, claiming the blood money of his son-Omar tells him: “He has no right to a dyia”; then the father answered: What will be your decision if my son had killed him”? Omar answered him: "in this case, you have to pay him the dyia" - The father then said: "So he is like a viper who left, she eats everything, killed, another viper will take revenge". (1) Al Sa'iba is a slave freed by his master without the latter retaining the right to patronize him. (2) It was said in pre-Islamic times when a viper was killed another viper took revenge on him. MOUATTAA In the name of Allah The Beneficent The Merciful Book 44 The Book of the "Kaçama" (1) Chapter one: On the primacy given to those entitled to do "the Kaçama" (1) The Kaçama: comes from the word "Kaçama" meaning: "to swear"; thus one asks the having rights to swear, in the event of a crime, in order to claim the price of the blood of their victim or the application of the talion. According to other scholars, it it is a matter of asking the heirs to make the oath fifty times, provided that they are males, and this according to their shares of inheritance. There, then, the term "Kaçama" means to distribute "the serme nt».
(1630) 1 - Sahl Ibn Abi Hathma reported that notables of his tribe told him the following: “Abdallah Ibn Sahl and Muhayssa, having suffered a total failure, went to Khaibar. They came to tell Muhayssa that Abdallah Ibn Sahl had been knocked unconscious and abandoned near a well or a palm tree. Of the Jews arriving at the place, Muhayssa said to them: “It is you, by Allah, who killed him”, and the Jews replied: “By Allah!, we did not kill him”. Mouhayssa, returned to his tribe, to inform them of the event, then came with his brother Houayssa, who was taller than him, and Abdul Rahman. Thus, Muhayssa, who was in Khaibar, wanting to speak, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) remarked to him: "May the greatest have the word »; Huayssa spoke, then his brother Muhayssa spoke in his turn, after which the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) answered them: "Or that the Jews pay the price of blood, or that the war is declared”. Then the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) informed the Jews of his decision in writing, who answered him: “By Allah! we did not kill him”. Then, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said to Huayssa, Muhayssa and Abdul Rahman: "Would you take an oath, which will make you deserve the price of blood of your brother”? When they refused, he continued: “Would you like the Jews to swear to it”? - "No, they answered him, they are not Muslims". Thus, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) paid them from his wealth (namely from the public treasury) the price of blood, sending them one hundred camels, which were returned to their abode, where Sahl said, "the camels being received by us, one of them, red-haired, kicked me".
(1631) 2 - Yahia Ibn Sa'id reported that Bouchair Ibn Yassar told him the following: "Abdallah Ibn Sahl al Ansari and Muhayssa Ibn Massou'd having gone to Khaibar where they separated for business, Abdallah Ibn Sahl was stunned. So Muhayssa came to the Prophet (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) accompanied by his elder brother-Houyassa and Abdul rahman Ibn Sahl. Abdul Rahman, being the brother of the victim, wanting to speak, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) said to him: “may the greatest have the word” ; thus Houayssa took the floor then Muhayssa, and learned from the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (On him the grace and the peace of Allah) does it. The Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) (Be upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said to them: "Would you, fifty times, swear and you would deserve the blood money of your brother or the culprit ”? They replied, “O Messenger of Allah! We were neither present nor witnesses to this fact”. Then the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the mercy and peace of Allah) said to them: “Do you want the Jews to swear to you their innocence, fifty times”? They replied, “No! Messenger of Allah! How could we accept the oath of unbelieving people? - Yahia Ibn Sa'id added: "Bouchair Ibn yassar claimed that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) paid with his goods, the price of blood" . - Malek said: "What is unquestionably followed at home (in Medina) and which I heard being practiced by those who accepted the Kaçama, and which, on the other hand had been concerted by the ulema in the past and nowadays, it is that one must proceed to make "the Kaçama", by asking the accused to take an oath. As a result, this Kaçama is only obligatory in two cases: either that the victim, before dying, says: "so-and-so killed me", or that the parents, again say, the beneficiaries present a evidence, however weak, and not conclusive against the culprit. In this case, the Kaçama is required for the accusers against the accused, and the Kaçama will never be admitted in any other case”. - Malek to add: “Such is the sunnah which is indisputable, and which moreover does not cease to be put into practice by people, namely, to ask the beneficiaries to start doing “the kaçama”, that it is a voluntary crime or not”. - Malek to continue: "and the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah) had first asked the men of the Haritha tribe - who are subject of the two hadiths precedents - to make the Kaçama with regard to their victim killed in Khaibar". - Malek said again: “If the accusers proceed to the “Kaçama”, they will be entitled to the price of the blood of their victim, and even to kill the culprit. However, "the Kaçama", being done, only one culprit will be killed, and never two. Thus, for "the Kaçama" to be executed, fifty men among the beneficiaries will make fifty oaths; but if their number is less or even if some abstain, their oath is no longer to be considered, and the others must thus complete the fifty oaths. But if among those who abstained, there is one of the heirs who has the right and the price of blood and the right to forgive, there will no longer be an application of the death penalty to the accused. - And Malek to continue: “Thus, if one of the fifty, not enjoying the right of pardon, abstains, the others will have to complete the fifty oaths; but if it is one of the heirs who is entitled to forgiveness, abstains, even if he were a single individual, the other heirs are not asked to complete the fifty oaths, for the good reason, that it comes back to the accused to take the oath for fifty times, so that each will do it for once; if the number is less than fifty, they will complete them; if there is only one accused, it is up to him alone to make the fifty oaths, if he is innocent”. - Malek to add: "Besides, one must make the distinction between the "Kaçama" concerning the price of blood, and the oaths suitable for rights (namely that the Kaçama requires fifty oaths, as for the other, it does not is only one oath). And Malek explains it: if a man owes a debt to another and he manages to prove it effectively, and the man intends to kill another, he will not kill him in the midst of people, but he tries to do it far from them, and without there being witnesses. Because if the Kaçama were to be considered, only in the case where there is clear evidence, and if we proceeded to put it into practice in the same way that is appropriate for the affirmation of other rights, blood would be shed. everywhere (meaning, that the killing will be increasing); therefore, people, taking part in it, would not stop practicing murder. However, the "Kaçama" was held as a norm to the heirs of the victim, starting with taking an oath, only with the aim of bringing people to reject the practice of killing; also, so that the murderer is only condemned according to what is decided by the victim before his death. - On the other hand, concerning the people, who are fifty in number being accused of a murder, while the number of heirs is less than that, Malek said: “Each of these heirs will make for fifty times an oath, emphasizing that their oaths will only be considered if each has sworn for fifty times”. And, that's the best I've heard about it. -Finally Malek said: "The Kaçama goes to the close relatives of the killed who are in fact his heirs; and who if they take an oath the accused will be killed. Chapter II The heirs from whom the Kaçama is accepted. (1632) - Malek said: "What is a norm unquestionably followed in (in Medina) is that one does not accept 'the Kacama' from women, when it is a voluntary crime- In case the victim does not only women are heirs, neither their Kaçama^ nor their forgiveness are accepted." - Malek added: a.- In case a man is voluntarily killed, and his relatives or his freedmen say: "We will oath and we will have the price of the blood of our victim" this is tolerated. b- - If the women want to forgive the culprit this is not allowed to them because the close male relatives and the freedmen have more rights than them by taking an oath to have blood money". c. - In case the near relatives and the freedmen pardon the culprit, after having had blood money, and that the women refuse saying: "We do not want to leave the murderer of our victim, there, they will have the right and the primacy to do it, because the one who is for the application of the law of retaliation has more right than the relatives and the women who left him, once this judgment was legally possible”. d. - For a crime made of any will, we do not accept less than two of the accusers who are asked to take an oath fifty times in order to have the right to condemn the culprit. And this is what is standard with us (in Medina)”. e. - If a group of people beat a man until he dies on the spot, all are punishable by death. So if he dies after this attack, we proceed to the Kaçama. This Kaçama is only held for a single man who is the victim and it is only to be applied in the case of a single man”. Chapter III The Kaçama relating to an involuntary crime (1633) - Yahia reported that he heard Malek say: "If it is an involuntary crime, the entitled persons are asked to take an oath for fifty times, according to the inheritance divided between them. If, the Kaçama done, fractions show themselves present, the one who has the largest share is asked to swear much more than the others (so that the fifty oaths are completed." - Malek said: "if the victim has only women to inherit it, they will take an oath and will have the dyia, if the victim has only one male heir, he will take an oath for fifty times and will have the dyia. case where it is an involuntary crime and not the contrary". Chapter IV Inheritance, in case the Kaçama is pronounced. (1634) - Malek said: "If the heirs entitled, accept the dyia, it will be divided between them, as prescribed in the Book of Allah, that the daughters of the victim, his sisters, as well as other females shall inherit this blood-money. , this comes down to the closest to the man killed." - And Malek added: "If any of the heirs of the man who was voluntarily killed expects to have his share of the dyia, which is of his right, while the others are not present, he can take nothing, and will not collect anything less or more from the dyia, before he has completed the Kaçama, namely , that the fifty oaths be made. So if these oaths are made, he will collect his share of the dyia, because in fact the blood money is only due if the fifty oaths have already been fulfilled, and the dyia is only due after the conviction of the culprit. . Now, if soon after one of the heirs arrives, and he swears as much as his share of the inheritance, he may have his share of the dyia until all the heirs have had it, at their turn. If a uterine brother presents himself, he will have the sixth of the dyia and will make 6/50 of the oaths; thus, every heir who has sworn an oath, will receive his portion; on the other hand, the one who prevents himself from doing it, he will receive nothing. On the other hand, if some heirs are absent, or even if there are prepubescent boys, those who are already present, each will make an oath proportional to his share of the dyia, as well as to his share of the l 'heritage. - Malek finally said, "and that's, what I help heard best about it." Chapter V The Kaçama of the Slaves (1635) - Malek said, "What is followed with us (in Medina), regarding the slaves in case one of them is voluntarily or involuntarily killed, and then his master present with a witness, swear only once, he is entitled to the price of his slave. Thus, on the subject of the voluntary or involuntary murder of slaves, the norm of the Kaçama is not applied, and I have not heard that a man versed in religion has acted otherwise”. Thus, continues Malek, if the slave is voluntarily or involuntarily killed, the master of this slave has neither to take account of a Kaçama, nor to sow; although this master is not entitled to the price of the slave, unless he presents clear evidence or a witness swearing with him”. - And Malek said, "That's the best I've heard about it." MOUATTAA In the Name of Allah The Clement The Merciful Book 45 The Book of Miscellaneous Subjects Chapter One: Prayers made for Medina and its inhabitants
(1636) 1 - Anas Ibn Malek reported that the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: “Great Allah! Bless them (the Medinese are implied) in their measure, bless them in their sa'as and mudds”.
(1637) 2 - Abu Houraira said: "When picking the first fruits, people brought them to the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him the grace and peace of Allah)". On taking it, the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Upon him be Allah's grace and peace) said: “Great Allah! Give us Your blessing in our fruits, bless us in our mudd. Great Allah! Abraham, your servant, your confidant friend, and your envoy, and I am your servant, your prophet. He invoked You for Mecca, and I invoke You for Medina, and I invoke You with the same intentions for Medina, just as he had done for Mecca, and once as much. . Then the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) called the smallest boy he had seen, and he gave him these first fruits”. Chapter II The subject of dwelling in Medina and leaving it.
(1638) 3 - Katan Ibn Wahb Ibn Oumair Ibn Al-Ajda' reported that Youhanness, the freedman of Al-Zoubair Ibn Al-Awwam taught him, that being seated at Abdallah Ibn Omar, when it was the he incursion (against Yazid Ibn Mu'awia), a slave came to greet him saying: "I want, O Abu Abdul-Rahman, to leave Medina, because life there is so difficult". Abdallah Ibn Omar replied: “Stay there, ignorant; I heard the Messenger of Allah (salallahou alayhi wa salam) r (Be upon him the grace and peace of Allah) say: "Anyone who endures the hard life in Medina, and the arduous conditions, I I will be an intercessor or a witness on the day of resurrection".
