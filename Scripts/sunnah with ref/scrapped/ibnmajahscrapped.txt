By Allah, I saw the same (dream) as him."

So he informed me that. Abu Mahdhurah said: 'I went out with a group of people, and we were somewhere on the road, when the Mu'adh-dhin of the Messenger of Allah gave the call to prayer in the presence of the Messenger of Allah. We heard the voice of the Mu'adh-dhin, and we were shunning it (the Adhan), so we started yelling, imitating it and mocking it. The Messenger of Allah heard us, so he sent some people who brought us to sit in front of him. He said: 'Who is the one whose voice I heard so loud?' The people all pointed to me, and they were telling the truth. He sent them all away, but kept me there and said to me: 'Stand up and give the call to prayer.' I stood up and there was nothing more hateful to me than the Messenger of Allah and what he was telling me to do. I stood up in front of the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger of Allah himself taught me the call. He said: "Say: 'Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar; Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah, Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah; Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah, Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah (Allah is the Most great, Allah is the most Great, Allah is the most Great, Allah is the most Great; I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah).'" Then he said: "Raise your voice (and say). Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah, Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah; Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah, Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah; Hayya 'alal-salah, Hayya 'alal-salah; Hayya 'alal-falah, Hayya 'alal-falah; Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar; La ilaha illallah (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; Come to the Prayer, Come to the Prayer; Come to the prosperity, Come to the prosperity; Allah is the Most great, Allah is the Most Great; None has the right to be worshipped but Allah).'" Then he called me when I had finished saying the Adhan, and gave me a small bag in which there was some silver. Then he put his hand on the forelock of Abu Mahdhurah, then passed it over his face, then over his chest, and over his heart, until the hand of the Messenger of Allah reached his navel. Then the Messenger of Allah said: 'May Allah bless you and send blessings upon you.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, do you command me to give the call to prayer in Makkah?' He said: 'Yes, I command you (to do so).' Then all the hatred I had felt towards the Messenger of Allah disappeared, and was replaced with love for the Messenger of Allah. I came to 'Attab bin Asid, the governor of the Messenger of Allah in Makkah, and gave the call to prayer with him by command of the Messenger of Allah." (Sahih)He ('Abdul-'Aziz) said: "Someone who met Abu Mahdhurah told me the same as 'Abdullah bin Muhairiz told me."

Do you think you could come and perform prayer in my house in a place which I can then take as a place of prayer?' He said: 'I will do that.'

777 | It was narrated that 'Abdullah said:"Whoever would like to meet Allah tomorrow (i.e. on the Day of Judgment) as a Muslim, let him preserve these five (daily) prayer when the call for them is given, for they are part of the ways of guidance, and Allah prescribed the ways of guidance to your Prophet. By Allah, if each of you prays in his house, you will have abandoned the Sunnah of your Prophet, and if you abandon the Sunnah of your Prophet you will go astray. I remember when no one stayed behind from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy. I have a man coming supported by two others, until he joined the row (of worshippers). There is no man who purifies himself and does it well, and comes to the mosque and prays there, but for every step that he takes, Allah raises him in status one degree thereby, and takes away one of his sins."
778 | It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever leaves his house for the prayer and says: 'Allahumma inni asa'luka bi-haqqis-sa'ilina 'alaika, wa as'aluka bi-haqqi mamshaya hadha, fa inni lam akhruj asharan wa la batran, wa la riya'an, wa la sum'atan, wa kharajtu-ttiqa'a sukhtika wabtigha'a mardatika, fa as'aluka an tu'idhani minan-nari wa an taghfira li dhunubi, Innahu la yaghfirudh-dhunuba illa Anta. (O Allah, I ask You by the right that those who ask of You have over You, and I ask by virtue of this walking of mine, for I am not going out because of pride or vanity, or to show off or make a reputation, rather I am going out because I fear Your wrath and seek Your pleasure. So I ask You to protect me from the Fire and to forgive me my sins, for no one can forgive sins except You),' Allah will turn His Face towards him and seventy thousand angels will pray for his forgiveness."

I felt sorry for him and said: 'O so-and-so, why do you not buy a donkey to spare yourself the heat of the scorching sand, to carry over the stony ground, and to keep you away from the vermin on the ground?' He said: 'By Allah! I do not want to live so close to Muhammed.' This troubled me until I came to the house of the Prophet and mentioned that to him. He called (the man) and asked him, and he said something similar, and said that he was hoping for the reward for his steps. The Messenger of Allah said, 'You will have that (reward) that you sought.'"
784 | It was narrated that Anas said:"Banu Salimah wanted to move from their homes to somewhere near the mosque, but the Prophet did not want the outskirts of Al-madinah to be left vacant, so he said: 'O Banu Salimah, do you not hope for the reward of your footsteps?' So they stayed (where they were)."
785 | It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"The houses of the Ansar were far from the mosque and they wanted to move closer. Then the following Verse was revealed: 'We record that which they send before (them), and their traces.'" [Ya-Sin: 12] He said: So they remained (where they were)."
786 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'A man's prayer in congregation is twenty-some levels higher than his prayer in his house or in the marketplace.'"

792 | It was narrated that Ibn Umm Maktum said:"I said to the Prophet: 'I am an old man and blind; my house is far away, and I have no one to lead me. Is there any concession (for me not to have to attend the prayer in the mosque)?' He said: 'Can you hear the call?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Then I do not find any concession for you.'"
793 | It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that:The Prophet said: "Whoever hears the call and does not come, his prayer is not valid, except for those who have an excuse."

They used to like (for the Imam) when he had finished reciting to remain silent until he had caught his breath.'"
845 | Samurah said:“I memorized two pauses in the prayer, a pause before reciting and a pause when bowing. ‘Imran bin Husain denied that, so they wrote to Al-Madinah, to Ubayy bin Ka’b, and he said that Samurah was speaking the truth.”

(Then say:) “Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa Rasuluhu (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).”    (Another chain) with similar wording.

And when he goes to his bed, let him glorify Allah and praise Him and extol Him one hundred times. That will be one hundred on the tongue and one thousand on the Scale. Who among you does two thousand and five hundred evil actions in one day?’ They said: ‘Who would not be keen to do that?’ He said: ‘But the Shaitan comes to anyone of you while he is performing prayer and says: ‘Remember such and such, remember such and such,” until the person becomes distracted and does not understand (what he is saying).

Praise Allah (by saying Al- Hamdu Lillah) after every prayer, and glorify Him (by saying Subhan- Allah) and extol Him (by saying Allahu Akbar), thirty-three, thirty- three, and thirty-four times.’” Sufyan said: “I do not know which of them was to be recited thirty-four times.”

The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Do you want to be a cause of Fitnah (trial, tribulation), O Mu’adh? When you lead the people in prayer, recite “By the sun and its brightness,”[Ash-Shams 91] and “Glorify the Name of your Lord the Most High,” [Al-A’la 87] and “By the night as it envelopes,” [Al-Lail 92] and “Recite in the Name of your Lord.’”[Al-‘Alaq]

1009 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik told that ‘Umar said:“I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why do you not take the Maqam of Ibrahim as a place of prayer?’ Then the following was revealed: ‘And take you (people) the Maqam of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.’” [2:125]
1010 | It was narrated that Bara’ said:“We prayed with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) facing towards Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for eighteen months, then the Qiblah was changed to the Ka’bah two months after the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Al-Madinah. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed towards Baitul-Maqdis, he would often lift his face towards the heavens, and Allah knew what was in the heart of His Prophet and how he longed to face the Ka’bah (during prayer). Jibril appeared (in the sky), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) started watching him as he was descending between the heavens and the earth, waiting to see what he would bring. Then Allah revealed the words: ‘Verily, We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah). And wherever you people are, turn your faces (during prayer) in that direction.’ [2:144] Then someone came to us and said: ‘The Qiblah has been changed to the Ka’bah.’ We had performed two Rak’ah facing towards Jerusalem. And we were bowing. So we turned around, and we continued our prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘O Jibril! What about our prayer facing towards Baitul- Maqdis?’ Then Allah revealed the words: “And Allah would never make your faith to be lost.” [2:143]
1011 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘What is between the east and the west is the Qiblah (prayer direction).’”*  *This refers to the Qiblah for the the inhabitants of Al-Madinah. (Makkah is to the exact south of Al-Madinah.)
1012 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When anyone of you enters the mosque, let him not sit down until he performs two Rak’ah.”

1014 | It was narrated from Ma’dan bin Abu Talhah Al-Ya’muri that ‘Umar bin Khattab stood up one Friday to deliver a sermon, or, he delivered a sermon one Friday. He praised Allah, then he said:“O people, you eat two plants that I find are nothing but obnoxious; this garlic and this onion. At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), if a foul odour was detected from a man, I would see him seized by the arm and taken out to Al-Baqi’. Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.”

I asked Suhaib, who was with him: ‘How did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) respond to them?’ He said: ‘He gestured with his hand.’”
1018 | It was narrated that Jabir said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) sent me on an errand, then I caught up with him while he was performing prayer, and I greeted him. He gestured to me, then when he finished, he called me and said: ‘You greeted me before, but I was performing prayer.’”
1019 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah said:“We would greet others during the prayer, and it was said to us: ‘During the prayer one is preoccupied.’”
1020 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amir bin Rabi’ah that his father said:“We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey, and the sky was overcast so it was difficult for us to determine the Qiblah. So we performed prayer, and we marked the location.* Later, when the sun reappeared, we realized that we had prayed facing a direction other than the Qiblah. We mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ), then the Words were revealed: ‘So wherever you turn there is the Face of Allah.’” [2:115]
1021 | It was narrated that Tariq bin ‘Abdullah Al-Muharibi said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘When you perform prayer, do not spit in front of you or to your right, but spit to your left or beneath your feet.’”
1022 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw some sputum in the direction of the Qiblah of the mosque. He turned to the people and said:“What is wrong with one of you that he stands facing Him (meaning his Lord) and spits in front of Him? Would anyone like to be faced by someone who spits in his face? If anyone of you needs to spit, then let him spit to his left, or let him do like this in his garment.”  Then Ismail (Abu Bakr bin Abu Shuaibah) showed me how he spat in his garment then rubbed it.
1023 | It was narrated from Hudhaifah that he saw Shabath bin Rib’i spitting in front of him. He said:“O Shabath! Do not spit in front of you, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to forbid that, and he said: ‘When a man stands up to perform prayer, Allah turns His Face towards him until he turns away or he commits an evil Hadath.’”*  * In Injah Al-Hajah, 'Abdul-Ghani Dehlawi said: "Meaning he does a matter that negates the Khushu'(submissiveness) and attentiveness of his prayer. Or, the meaning of Hadath is invalidating the ablution. The only reason that he described it as 'evil' is because in most cases, its occurrence during prayer is from Shaitan."
1024 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spat on his garment while he was performing prayer, then he rubbed it.
1025 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever smoothes the pebbles, then he has engaged in Laghw.”*  *Meaning he has done what is not suitable.

Then Allah revealed: “And indeed, We know the first generations of you who had passed away, and indeed, We know the present generations of you (mankind), and also those who will some afterwards.” [15:24] concerning her matter.

Go back and repeat your prayer, for you have not prayed.” So he went back and repeated his prayer, then he came and greeted the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: “And also upon you. Go back and repeat your prayer, for you have not prayed.” On the third occasion, the man said: “Teach me, O Messenger of Allah!” He said: “When you stand up to offer the prayer, perform ablution properly, then stand to face the prayer direction and say Allahu Akbar. Then recite whatever you can of Qur’an, and then bow until you can feel at ease bowing. Then stand up until you feel at ease standing, then prostrate until you feel at ease prostrating. Then raise your head until you are sitting up straight. Do that throughout your prayer.”
1061 | Muhammad bin ‘Amr bin ‘Ata’ said:‘While he was among ten of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) including Abu Qatadah: “I heard Abu Humaid As-Sa’idi say: ‘I am the most knowledgeable of you concerning the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ They said: ‘Why? By Allah, you did not follow him more than we did, and you did not accompany him for longer.’ He said: ‘Yes I am.’ They said: ‘Show us.’ He said: ‘When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up for prayer, he would say the Takbir, then he would raise his hands parallel to his shoulders, and every part of his body would settle in place. Then he would recite, then he would raise his hands parallel to his shoulders and bow, placing his palms on his knees and supporting his weight on them. He neither lowered his head, nor raised it up, it was evenly balanced (between either extreme). Then he would say: “Sami’ Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears those who praise Him); and he would raise his hands parallel with his shoulders, until every bone returned to its place. Then he would prostrate himself on the ground, keeping his arms away from his sides. Then he would raise his head and tuck his left foot under him and sit on it, and he would spread his toes when he prostrated.* Then he would prostrate, then say the Takbir and sit on his left foot, until every bone returned to its place. Then he would stand up and do the same in the next Rak’ah. Then when he stood up after two Rak’ah, he would raise his hands level with his shoulders as he did at the beginning of the prayer. Then he would offer the rest of his prayer in like manner until, when he did the prostration after which the Taslim comes, he would push one of his feet back and sit with his weight on his left side, Mutawarrikan.’** They said: ‘You have spoken the truth; this is how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to perform the prayer.’”  * Meaning that he would plant them in such a way that they were facing the Qiblah.  ** Mutawarrikan: i.e., sitting with the left foot brought forward so that one's buttocks are in direct contact with the ground.
1062 | It was narrated that ‘Amrah said:“I asked ‘Aishah: ‘How did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) perform prayer?’ She said: ‘When the Prophet (ﷺ) performed ablution, he would put his hand in the vessel and say Bismillah, and he would perform ablution properly. Then he would stand and face the Qiblah. He would say the Takbir raising his hands parallel to his shoulders. Then he would bow, putting his hands on his knees and keeping his arms away from his sides. Then he would raise his head and straighten his back, and he would stand a little longer than your standing. Then he would prostrate, pointing his hands towards the Qiblah, keeping his arms away (from his sides) as much as possible, according to what I have seen. Then he would raise his head and sit on his left foot with his right foot held upright, and he disliked leaning towards his left side.’”

1066 | It was narrated from Umayyah bin ‘Abdullah bin Khalid that he said to ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar:“We find (mention of) the prayer of the resident and the prayer in a state of fear in the Qur’an, but we do not find any mention of the prayer of the traveler. ‘Abdullah said to him: “Allah sent Muhammad (ﷺ) to us, and we did not know anything, rather we do what we saw Muhammad (ﷺ) doing.”

He said: ‘What are these people doing?’ I said: ‘Glorifying Allah.’* He said: ‘If I wanted to glorify Allah (perform voluntary prayer) I would have completed my prayer. O son of my brother! I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he never prayed more than two Rak’ah when he was traveling, until Allah took his soul. Then I accompanied Abu Bakr and he never prayed more than two Rak’ah (when he was traveling), until Allah took his soul. Then I accompanied ‘Umar and he never prayed more than two Rak’ah, until Allah took his soul. Then I accompanied ‘Uthman and he never prayed more than two Rak’ah, until Allah took his soul. Allah says: ‘Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad (ﷺ)) you have a good example to follow.’” [33:21]  * Meaning, they were offering voluntary prayer.
1072 | Usamah bin Zaid said:“I asked Tawus about performing voluntary prayer while traveling. Al-Hasan bin Muslim bin Yannaq was sitting with him and he said: ‘Tawus told me that he heard Ibn ‘Abbas say: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) enjoined prayer while a resident and prayer when one is traveling. We used to pray when we were residents both before and after (the obligatory prayer), and we used to pray both before and after (the obligatory prayer) when we were traveling.’”

Hasten to do good deeds before you become preoccupied (because of sickness and old age). Uphold the relationship that exists between you and your Lord by remembering Him a great deal and by giving a great deal of charity in secret and openly. (Then) you will be granted provision and Divine support, and your condition will improve. Know that Allah has enjoined Friday upon you in this place of mine, on this day, in this month, in this year, until the Day of Resurrection. Whoever abandons it, whether during my lifetime or after I am gone, whether he has a just or an unjust ruler, whether he takes it lightly or denies (that it is obligatory), may Allah cause him to lose all sense of tranquility and contentment, and may He not bless him in his affairs. Indeed, his prayer will not be valid, his Zakat will not be valid, his Hajj will not be valid, his fasting will not be valid, and his righteous deeds will not be accepted, until he repents. Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance. No woman should be appointed as Imam over a man, no Bedouin should be appointed as Imam over a Muhajir, no immoral person should be appointed as Imam over a (true) believer, unless that is forced upon him and he fears his sword or whip.’”
1082 | It was narrated that ‘Abdur-Rahman bin Ka’b bin Malik said:“I used to guide my father after he lost his sight, and when I took him out for the Friday (prayer), when he heard the Adhan he would pray for forgiveness for Abu Umamah As’ad bin Zurarah, and supplicate for him. I heard that from him for a while, then I said to myself: ‘By Allah! What is this weakness? Every time he heard the Adhan for Friday (prayer) I hear him praying for forgiveness for Abu Umamah and supplicate for him, and I do not ask him about why he does that.’ Then I took him out for Friday (prayer), as I used to take him out, and when he heard the Adhan he prayed for forgiveness as he used to do. I said to him: ‘O my father! I see you supplicating for As’ad bin Zurarah every time you hear the call for Friday; why is that?’ He said: ‘O my son, he was the first one who led us for the Friday prayer before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came from Makkah, in Naqi’ Al- Khadamat (a place near Al-Madinah), in the plain of Harrah Banu Bayadah.’ I asked: ‘How many of you were there at that time?’ He said: ‘Forty men.’”
1083 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Allah led those who came before us astray from Friday. Saturday was for the Jews and Sunday was for the Christians. And they will lag behind us until the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of the people of this world but we will be the first to be judged among all of creation.’”
1084 | It was narrated that Abu Lubabah bin ‘Abdul-Mundhir said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Friday is the chief of days, the greatest day before Allah. It is greater before Allah then the Day of Adha and the Day of Fitr. It has five characteristics: On it Allah created Adam; on it Allah sent down Adam to this earth; on it there is a time during which a person does not ask Allah for anything but He will give it to him, so long as he does not ask for anything that is forbidden; on it the Hour will begin. There is no angel who is close to Allah, no heaven, no earth, no wind, no mountain, and no sea that does not fear Friday.’”
1085 | It was narrated that Shaddad bin Aws said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘The best of your days is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it the Trumpet will be blown, on it all creatures will swoon. So send a great deal of peace and blessings upon me on that day, for your peace and blessings will be presented to me.’ A man said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, how will our peace and blessings be shown to you when you will have disintegrated?’ He said: ‘Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets.’”
1086 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“From one Friday to the next is an expiation for whatever was committed in between, so long as one does not commit any major sin.”

1092 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When Friday comes, angels stand at every door of the mosque and record the names of the people who come, in order of arrival. When the Imam comes out, they close their records and listen to the sermon. The first one who comes to the prayer is like one who sacrifices a camel; the one who comes after him is like one who sacrifices a cow; the one who comes after him is like one who sacrifices a ram,” (and so on) until he made mention of a hen and an egg. Sahl added in his Hadith: “And whoever comes after that comes only to do his duty with regard to the prayer.”
1093 | It was narrated from Samurah bin Jundab that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) described the likeness of Friday, saying that those who come earliest are like the one who sacrifices a camel, then like one who sacrifices a cow, then like one who sacrifices a sheep, until he made mention of a chicken.

Abu Darda’ or Abu Dharr raised an eyebrow at me and said: ‘When was this Surah revealed? For I have not heard it before now.’ He (Ubayy) gestured to him that he should remain silent. When they finished, he said: ‘I asked you when this Surah was revealed and you did not answer me.” Ubayy said: ‘You have gained nothing from your prayer today except the idle talk that you engaged in.’ He went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and told him about that, and what Ubayy had said to him.

(i.e., don’t think about it at all).’ I raised my head and saw As- Simak.* He repeated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ‘Night prayers are to be offered two by two, and Witr is one Rak’ah, before dawn.’”  * Here, As-Simak refers to a star or stars, either Arcturus (As-Simak Ar-Ramih) or Spica, also called Alpha Virginis (As-Simak Al-A'zal).
1176 | A man asked Ibn ‘Umar:“How should I perform Witr?” He said: “Pray Witr with one Rak’ah.” He said: “I am afraid that the people will say that I am cutting the prayer short.” He said: “The Sunnah of Allah and His Messenger.” Meaning “This is the Sunnah of Allah and His Messenger.”
1177 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say Taslim after every two Rak’ah, and he would perform Witr with one Rak’ah.”
1178 | It was narrated that Al-Hasan bin ‘Ali said:“My grandfather, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), taught me some words to say in Qunut of Witr: Allahumma ‘afini fiman ‘afait, wa tawallani fiman tawallait, wahdini fiman hadait, wa qini sharra ma qadait, wa barik li fima a’tait. Innaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alaik, innahu la yudhillu man walait. Subhanaka rabbana tabarakta wa ta’alait (O Allah, pardon me along with those whom You have pardoned, be an ally to me along with those whom You are an ally to, guide me along with those whom You have guided, protect me from the evil that You have decreed, and bless for me that which You have bestowed. For verily You decree and none can decree over You. He whom You support can never be humiliated. Glory is to You, our Lord, You are Blessed and Exalted).”
1179 | It was narrated from ‘Ali bin Abi Talib that the Prophet (ﷺ) used to say at the end of Witr:“Allahumma inni a’udhu biridaka min sakhatika, wa a’udhu bimu’afatika min ‘uqubatika, wa a’udhu bika minka, la uhsi thana’an ‘alaika, Anta kama athnaita ‘ala nafsika (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, and I seek refuge in Your forgiveness from your punishment, and I seek refuge in You from You. I cannot enumerate Your praise, You are as You have praised Yourself).”

1191 | It was narrated that Sa’d bin Hisham said:“I asked ‘Aishah: ‘O Mother of the Believers! Tell me about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ She said: ‘We used to keep his tooth stick and water for ablution ready for him. Allah would wake him as He willed to during the night, and he would use the tooth stick and perform ablution, then he would pray nine Rak’ah, during which he would not sit until the eighth Rak’ah. Then he would call upon his Lord and remember Allah and praise Him and supplicate to Him. Then he would get up without saying the Salam. Then he would stand up and pray the ninth Rak’ah. Then he would sit and remember Allah and praise Him, and supplicate to his Lord and send blessing upon His Prophet. Then he would say Salam that we could hear. Then he would pray two Rak’ah after the Salam, while he was sitting down. That was eleven Rak’ah. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) grew older and had gained weight, he would pray Witr with seven Rak’ah and then pray two more Rak’ah after he had said the Salam.’”

1200 | It was narrated that Sa’eed bin Yasar said:“I was with Ibn ‘Umar and I lagged behind and prayed Witr. He said: ‘What kept you?’ I said: ‘I was praying Witr.’ He said: ‘Do you not have the best of examples in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?’ I said: ‘Of course.’ He said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray Witr while riding his camel.’”

1203 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed, and he added or omitted something.” (One of the narrators) Ibrahim said: “The confusion stems from me (i.e., he was not sure which it was).” “It was said to him: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Has something been added to the prayer?’ He said: ‘I am only human, I forget just as you forget. If anyone forgets, let him perform two prostrations when he is sitting (at the end).’ Then the Prophet (ﷺ) turned and prostrated twice.”
1204 | ‘Iyad narrated that he asked Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri:“One of us prays and he does not know how many (Rak’ah) he has prayed.” He said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘When anyone of you prays and does not know how many he has prayed, let him perform two prostrations while he is sitting.’”
1205 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah said:“(Once) the Prophet (ﷺ) prayed Zuhr with five Rak’ah, and it was said to him: ‘Has something been added to the prayer?’ He said: ‘What is that?’ They told him, and he turned back towards the Qiblah and performed two prostrations.”
1206 | It was narrated from Ibn Buhainah:“The Prophet (ﷺ) offered prayer, I think it was the ‘Asr, and in the second Rak’ah he stood up before he sat. Before he said the Salam, he prostrated twice.”
1207 | It was narrated from ‘Abdur-Rahman Al-A’raj that Ibn Buhainah told him that the Prophet (ﷺ) stood up in the second Rak’ah of Zuhr and forgot to sit. When he had finished his prayer, and before he said the Salam, he performed the two prostrations for forgetfulness (Sahw) and said the Salam.
1208 | It was narrated that Mughirah bin Shu’bah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘If anyone of you stands after two Rak’ah, if he has not yet stood up fully, let him sit down again, but if he has stood up fully, then let him not sit down, and let him perform two prostrations for forgetfulness (Sahw).’”
1209 | It was narrated that ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘If anyone of you is uncertain as to whether he has prayed one or two Rak’ah, let him assume it is one. If he is uncertain as to whether he has prayed two or three, let him assume it is two. If he is uncertain as to whether he has prayed three or four, let him assume it is three. Then let him complete what is left of his prayer, so that the doubt will be about what is more. Then let him prostrate twice while he is sitting, before the Taslim (saying the Salam).’”
1210 | It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘If anyone of you is uncertain about his prayer, let him put aside uncertainty and act upon that which is certain. When he has made sure his prayer is complete, then let him prostrate twice. Then if his prayer was complete, that (extra) Rak’ah will be counted as voluntary, and if his prayer was lacking, that Rak’ah will complete his prayer, and the two prostrations will rub the Satan’s nose in the dust.’”
1211 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered prayer, and I am not sure whether he did something extra or omitted something. He asked, and we told him, so he turned to face the Qiblah and prostrated twice, then he said the Salam. Then he turned to face us and said: ‘If any new command has been revealed concerning the prayer, I would certainly have told you. But I am only human and I forget and you forget. If I forget, then remind me. And if anyone of you is uncertain about the prayer, let him do what is closest to what is correct, then complete the prayer, say the Salam and prostrate twice.”
1212 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘If anyone of you is uncertain about his prayer, let him try to do what is correct then let him prostrate twice.’”  Tanafisi said: "This is the basic rule, and no one is able to reject it."
1213 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forgot and said the Taslim after two Rak’ah. A man who was called Dhul-Yadain said to him:‘O Messenger of Allah, has the prayer been shortened or did you forget?’ He said: ‘It has not been shortened and I did not forget.’ He said: ‘But you prayed two Rak’ah.’ He said: ‘Is what Dhul-Yadain says true?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ So he went forward and performed two Rak’ah and said the Salam, then he prostrated twice for prostrations of forgetfulness.
1214 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in one of the afternoon prayers, and he prayed two Rak’ah, then he said the Salam. Then he stood up and went to a piece of wood in the mosque, and leaned against it. Those who were in a hurry left the mosque, saying that the prayer had been shortened. Among the people were Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, but they dared not say anything. Among the people there was also a man with long hands who was called Dhul- Yadain. He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, has the prayer been shortened or did you forget?’ He said: ‘It has not been shortened and I did not forget.’ He said: ‘But you prayed two Rak’ah.’ He said: ‘Is what Dhul- Yadain says true?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ So he went forward and performed two Rak’ah and said the Salam, then he prostrated twice, and then he said the Salam again.”
1215 | It was narrated that ‘Imran bin Husain said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said the Salam after three Rak’ah for ‘Asr, then he stood up and went into the apartment. Khirbaq, a man with big hands, stood up and called out: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Has the prayer been shortened?’ He came out angrily, dragging his lower garment, and asked about it, and was told (what had happened). So he performed the Rak’ah that he had omitted, then he said the Salam, then he prostrated twice and said the Salam again.”
1216 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The Satan comes to any one of you while he is praying and comes between him and his soul, until he does not know whether he as added something or omitted something. If that happens, then he should prostrate twice before the Salam, then he should say the Salam.”
1217 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The Satan comes between the son of Adam and his soul, and he does not know how many Rak’ah he has prayed. If a person notices that, then let him prostrate twice before he says the Salam.”

1221 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever vomits, has a nosebleed, belches, or emits prostatic fluid, should stop praying; perform ablution, then resume his prayer, and while he is in that state he should not speak.”
1222 | It was narrated from ‘Aishah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“When anyone of you performs prayer and commits Hadath, (passing wind) let him take hold of his nose, then leave.”  Another chain with similar wording.

1224 | It was narrated that Wa’il bin Hujr said:“I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) performing prayer while sitting on his right side when he was sick.”
1225 | It was narrated that Umm Salamah said:‘By the One Who took his soul (i.e., the soul of the Prophet (ﷺ)), he did not die until he offered most of his prayers sitting down. And the dearest of the actions to him was the righteous action that the person does regularly, even if it were a little.”
1226 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) used to recite Qur’an sitting down, then when he wanted to bow he would stand up for as long as it takes a person to recite forty Verses.”
1227 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“I did not see the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offer any of the night prayers in any way other than standing, until he became old. Then he started to pray sitting down until, when there were thirty or forty Verses left of his recitation, he would stand up and recite them, and prostrate.”
1228 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Shaqiq Al-‘Uqaili said:“I asked ‘Aishah about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at night. She said: ‘He used to pray for a long time at night standing up, and for a long time at night sitting down. If he prayed standing, he would bow standing, and if he prayed sitting, he would bow sitting.’”

1230 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out and saw some people praying while sitting down. He said:“The prayer of one who sits down is equivalent to half of the prayer of one who stands.”
1231 | It was narrated from ‘Imran bin Husain that he asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about a man who prays sitting down. He said, “Whoever performs prayer standing up, that is better. Whoever performs prayer sitting down will have half the reward of one who prays standing. And whoever performs prayer lying down will have half the reward of one who prays sitting.”
1232 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fell ill with the sickness that would be his last” – (One of the narrators) Abu Mu’awiyah said: “When he was overcome by sickness” – “Bilal came to tell him that it was time for prayer. He said, ‘Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’ We said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Abu Bakr is a tender-hearted man, and when he takes your place he will weep and not be able to do it. Why do you not tell ‘Umar to lead the people in prayer?’ He said: ‘Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer; you are (like) the female companions of Yusuf.’” She said: “So we sent word to Abu Bakr, and he led the people in prayer. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to feel a little better, so he came out to the prayer, supported by two men with his feet making lines along the ground. When Abu Bakr realized that he was there, he wanted to step back, but the Prophet (ﷺ) gestured to him to stay where he was. Then (the two men) brought him to sit beside Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr was following the lead of the Prophet (ﷺ) and the people were following Abu Bakr.”
1233 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer when he was sick, and Abu Bakr used to lead them in prayer. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to feel a little better, so he came out, and saw Abu Bakr leading the people in prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him, he stepped back, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gestured to him to stay where he was. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat beside Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr was following the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the people were following the prayer of Abu Bakr.”
1234 | It was narrated that Salim bin ‘Ubaid said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fainted when he was sick, then he woke up and said: ‘Has the time for prayer come?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Tell Bilal to call the Adhan, and tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’ Then he fainted, then he woke up and said: ‘Has the time for prayer come?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Tell Bilal to call the Adhan, and tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’ Then he fainted, then he woke up and said: ‘Has the time for prayer come?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Tell Bilal to call the Adhan, and tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’ ‘Aishah said: ‘My father is a tender-hearted man, and if he stands in that place he will weep and will not be able to do it. If you told someone else to do it (that would be better).’ Then he fainted, then woke up and said: ‘Tell Bilal to call the Adhan, and tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer. You are (like) the female companions of Yusuf.’ So Bilal was told to call the Adhan and he did so, and Abu Bakr was told to lead the people in prayer, and he did so.  Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt a little better, and he said: ‘Find me someone I can lean on.’ Barirah and another man came, and he leaned on them. When Abu Bakr saw him, he started to step back, but (the Prophet (ﷺ)) gestured him to stay where he was. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and sat beside Abu Bakr, until Abu Bakr finished praying. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed away.”
1235 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fell ill with what would be his final illness, he was in the house of ‘Aishah. He said: ‘Call ‘Ali for me.’ ‘Aishah said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, should we call Abu Bakr for you?’ He said: ‘Call him.’ Hafsah said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, should we call ‘Umar for you?’ He said: ‘Call him.’ Ummul-Fadl said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, should we call Al-‘Abbas for you?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ When they had gathered, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lifted his head, looked and fell silent. ‘Umar said: ‘Get up and leave the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ Then Bilal came to tell him that the time for prayer had come, and he said: ‘Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’ ‘Aishah said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr is a soft and tender-hearted man, and if he does not see you, he will weep and the people will weep with him. If you tell ‘Umar to lead the people in prayer (that would be better).’ Abu Bakr went out and led the people in prayer, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt a little better, so he came out, supported by two men, with his feet making lines along the ground. When the people saw him, they said: ‘Subhan-Allah,’ to alert Abu Bakr. He wanted to step back, but the Prophet (ﷺ) gestured him to stay where he was. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and sat on his right. Abu Bakr stood up and he was following the lead of the Prophet (ﷺ), and the people were following the lead of Abu Bakr. Ibn ‘Abbas said; ‘And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) started to recite from where Abu Bakr had reached.’”
1236 | Hamzah bin Mughirah bin Shu’bah narrated that his father said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lagged behind (on a journey) and we reached the people when ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf had already led them in one Rak’ah of the prayer. When he realized that the Prophet (ﷺ) was there, he wanted to step back, but the Prophet (ﷺ) gestured to him that he should complete the prayer. He said: ‘You have done well, do the same in the future.’”
1237 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fell ill and some of his Companions came to visit him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed prayer while sitting down, and they prayed behind him standing up. He gestured them to sit down, and when he finished he said: ‘The Imam is appointed to be followed. When he bows, then bow; when he stands up again, then stand up, and if he prays sitting down then pray sitting down.’”
1238 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Prophet (ﷺ) fell from his horse and he suffered some lacerations on his right side. We went to visit him and the time for prayer came. He led us in prayer sitting down, and we prayed behind him sitting down. When he finished the prayer he said:“The Imam is appointed to be followed. When he says Allahu Akbar, then say Allahu Akbar; when he bows, then bow; when he says Sami’ Allahu liman hamidah, then say Rabbana wa lakal-hamd; when he prostrates then prostrate; and if he prays sitting down then pray sitting down.”
1239 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘The Imam is appointed to be followed. When he says Allahu Akbar, then say Allahu Akbar; when he bows, then bow; when he says Sami’ Allahu liman hamidah, then say Rabbana wa lakal-hamd; when he prostrates then prostrate; if he prays standing, then pray standing, and if he prays sitting down then pray sitting down.”
1240 | It was narrated that Jabir said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fell ill, and we prayed behind him while he was sitting down, and Abu Bakr was saying the Takbir so that the people could hear them. He turned to us and saw us standing, so he gestured to us to sit down. When he had said the Salam, he said: ‘You were about to do the action of the Persians and Romans, who remain standing while their kings are seated. Do not do that. Follow the lead of your Imam; if he prays standing, then pray standing, and if he prays sitting down, then pray sitting down.’”
1241 | Sa’d bin Tariq said:“I said to my father: ‘O my father! You prayed behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and behind Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthman, and behind ‘Ali here in Kufah for about five years. Did they recite Qunut in Fajr?’ He said: ‘O my son! That is an innovation.’”
1242 | It was narrated that Umm Salamah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was forbidden to recite Qunut in Fajr.”
1243 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite Qunut in the Subh prayer, and he used to supplicate in it against one of the Arab tribes for a month, then he stopped doing so.
1244 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his head from Ruku’ in the Subh prayer, he said: ‘O Allah, save Al-Walid bin Walid, Salamah bin Hisham and ‘Ayyash bin Abu Rabi’ah, and the oppressed in Makkah. O Allah, tighten Your grip on Mudar, and send them years of famine like the famine of Yusuf.”
1245 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) commanded killing the two black ones during prayer; the scorpion and the snake.
1246 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) was stung by a scorpion while he was performing prayer, and he said: ‘May Allah curse the scorpion, for it does not spare anyone, whether he is praying or not. Kill them whether you are in Ihram or not.’” In Al-Hill (outside the sacred precincts of Makkah) or Al-Haram (the sacred precincts or Makkah).
1247 | It was narrated from Ibn Abu Rafi’, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Prophet (ﷺ) killed a scorpion while he was praying.
1248 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade two prayers:prayer after the Fajr until the sun has risen, and prayer after ‘Asr until the sun has set.
1249 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“There is no prayer after the ‘Asr until the sun has set, and there is no prayer after the Fajr until the sun has risen.”
1250 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“Good men among whom was ‘Umar bin Khattab, and the best of them in my view is ‘Umar, testified before me that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘There is no prayer after Fajr until the sun has risen, and there is no prayer after the ‘Asr until the sun has set.’”
1251 | It was narrated that ‘Amr bin ‘Abasah said:“I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: ‘Is there any time that is more beloved to Allah than another?’ He said: ‘Yes, the middle of the night, so pray as much as you want until dawn comes. Then refrain from praying until the sun has risen, and as long as it looks like a shield until it becomes apparent. Then pray as much as you want until a pole stands on its shadow (i.e., noon), then refrain from praying until it has crossed the zenith, for Hell is heated up at midday. Then pray as much as you want until you pray ‘Asr, then refrain from praying until the sun has set, for it sets between the two horns of Satan and it rises between the two horns of Satan.’”
1252 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“Safwan bin Mu’attal asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): ‘O Messenger of Allah, I want to ask you about something of which you have knowledge and I know nothing.’ He said: ‘What is it?’ He said: ‘Is there any time of the night or day when it is disliked to perform prayer? He said: ‘Yes, when you have prayed the Subh, then do not pray until the sun has risen, for it rises between the two horns of Satan. Then pray, for the prayer is attended (by the angels) and is acceptable (to Allah) until the sun is right overhead like a spear. For at that time Hell is heated up and its gates are opened. (Then refrain from prayer) until the sun passes the zenith. Then when it has passed the zenith, the prayer is attended (by the angels) and is acceptable (to Allah) until you pray the ‘Asr. Then stop praying until the sun has set.’”
1253 | It was narrated from Abu ‘Abdullah As-Sunabihi that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The sun rises between the two horns of Satan” or he said “The two horns of Satan rise with it, and when it has risen, Satan parts from it. When it is in the middle of the sky he accompanies it, then when it has crossed the zenith he parts from it. When it is about to set, he accompanies it, and when it has set he parts from it. So do no pray at these three times.”

1256 | It was narrated from Abu Dharr that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Offer prayer on time, and if you reached the Imam leading them in prayers (on time), then perform it with them, and you will be safe with your prayer, otherwise it will be voluntary for you.”
1257 | It was narrated from ‘Ubadah bin Samit that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“There will be leaders who will be distracted by matters and they will delay the prayer until after its proper time. So make your prayer with them voluntary.”
1258 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said concerning the fear prayer: “The Imam should lead one group in prayer, and they should perform one prostration, and there should be another group between them and the enemy (guarding them). Then those who did the prostration with their leader should move away, and take the place of those who have not yet prayed. Then those who have not yet prayed should come forward and perform one prostration with their leader. Then their leader should move away, and his prayer will be complete. Then each group should perform one prostration by itself. If the fear is too great, then (they should pray) on foot or riding.’” He said: What is meant by prostration here is a Rak’ah.
1259 | It was narrated from Sahl bin Abu Hathmah that he said concerning the fear prayer:“The Imam should stand facing the Qiblah, and a group of them should stand with him, and another group should stand in the direction of the enemy, facing towards the row (of worshippers). He should lead them in one Rak’ah, then they should bow and do two prostrations by themselves where they are. Then they should go and take the place of the others, and the others should come and pray one Rak’ah, bowing and prostrating with the leader. Then he will have prayed two Rak’ah and they will have prayed one; then they should perform another Rak’ah, bowing and performing two prostrations.”
1260 | It was narrated from Jabir bin ‘Abdullah that the Prophet (ﷺ) led his Companions in the fear prayer. He led them all in bowing, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the row nearest him prostrated, and the others stood up, then when he stood up, they prostrated twice by themselves. Then the front row moved back and took their place, and they moved forward until they formed the front row. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) led them all in bowing, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the row nearest to him prostrated, and when they raised their heads, the others prostrated twice. So all of them bowed with the Prophet (ﷺ) and some of them prostrated by themselves, and the enemy was in the direction of the Qiblah.
1261 | It was narrated that Abu Mas’ud said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “The sun and the moon do not become eclipsed for the death of anyone among mankind. If you see that, then stand and perform prayer.”
1262 | It was narrated that Nu’man bin Bashir said:“The sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he came out alarmed, dragging his lower garment, until he reached the mosque. He continued to perform prayer until the eclipse was over, then he said: ‘Some people claim that the sun and moon only become eclipsed because of the death of a great leader. That is not so. The sun and the moon do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. When Allah manifests Himself to anything in His creation, it humbles itself before Him.’”
1263 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The sun was eclipsed during the life of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to the mosque and stood and said the Takbir, and the people formed rows behind him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited for a long time, then he said the Takbir and bowed for a long time. Then he raised his head and said: ‘Sami’ Allahu liman hamidah, Rabban was lakal-hamd.’ Then he stood and recited for a long time, but shorter than the first recitation. Then he said the Takbir and bowed for a long time, but less than the first bowing. Then he said: ‘Sami’ Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal-hamd.’ Then he did the same in the next Rak’ah, and he completed four Rak’ah and four sets of prostration, and the eclipse ended before he finished. Then he stood and addressed the people. He praised Allah as He deserves to be praised, then he said: ‘The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see that then seek help in prayer.’”
1264 | It was narrated that Samurah bin Jundab said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in the eclipse prayer, and we did not hear his voice.”
1265 | It was narrated that Asma’ bint Abu Bakr said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed the eclipse prayer. He stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up, then he prostrated for a long time, then he sat up, then he prostrated for a long time. He stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up, then he prostrated for a long time, then he sat up, then he prostrated for a long time. Then he finished and said: ‘Paradise was brought close to me, so that if I had dared, I could have brought you some of its fruits. And Hell was brought near to me, until I said: “O Lord, am I one of them?” Nafi’ said: “I think that he said: ‘And I saw a woman being scratched by a cat that belonged to her. I said: “What is wrong with this woman?” They said: “She detained it until it died of hunger; she did not feed it and she did not let it loose to eat of the vermin of the earth.”
1266 | It was narrated from Hisham bin Ishaq bin ‘Abdullah bin Kinanah that his father said:“One of the chiefs* sent me to Ibn ‘Abbas to ask him about the prayer for rain.

1267 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Abu Bakr said:“I heard ‘Abbad bin Tamim narrating to my father that his paternal uncle had seen the Prophet (ﷺ) going out to the prayer place to pray for rain. He faced the Qiblah and turned his cloak around, and prayed two Rak’ah.”  (One of the narrators) Muhammad bin Sabbah said: “Sufyan told us something similar, narrating from Yahya bin Sa`eed, from Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin `Amr bin Hazm. from `Abbad bin Tamim, from his paternal uncle, from the Prophet (ﷺ).”  Sufyan narrated that Al-Mas`udi said: “I asked Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin `Amr: 'Did he turn it upside down or right to left?' He said: 'No, it was right to left.'”
1268 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out one day to pray for rain. He led us in praying two Rak’ah without any Adhan or Iqamah, then he addressed us and supplicated to Allah.

1269 | It was narrated from Shurahbil bin Simt that he said to Ka’b:“O Ka’b bin Murrah, narrate to us a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but be careful.” He said: “A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, ask Allah for rain!’ So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his hands and said: ‘O Allah! Send wholesome, productive rain upon all of us, sooner rather than later, beneficial and not harmful.’ No sooner had they finished performing Friday (prayer) but they were revived. Then they came to him and complained to him about the rain, saying: ‘O Allah, around us and not upon us.’ Then the clouds began to disperse right and left.”
1270 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“A Bedouin came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have come to you from people who have no place to graze their flocks and even their male camels have become weak.

1272 | Salim narrated that his father said:“Sometimes I remember the words of the poet when I was looking at the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the pulpit. He did not come down until all the waterspouts in Al-Madinah were filled with rain. And I remember what the poet said:   ‘He has a white complexion and rain is sought by virtue of his countenance,  He cares for the orphans, and protects the widows,  These are the words of Abu Talib.”
1273 | It was narrated that ‘Ata’ said:“I heard Ibn ‘Abbas say: ‘I bear witness that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed before the sermon, then he delivered the sermon.

You have brought the pulpit out on the day of ‘Eid and it was not brought out before, and you started with the sermon before the prayer, when this was not done before.’ Abu Sa’eed said: ‘As for this man, he has done his duty. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, and he is able to change it with his hand, then change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, (do so) with his tongue then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot then with his heart (by hating it and feeling that it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.”

He used to come to us every night after the ‘Isha’ and speak to us standing on his two feet, until he started to shift his weight from one foot to the other. Most of what he told us was what he had suffered from his people, the Quraish. He said: ‘(The two sides) were not equal. We were weak and oppressed and humiliated, and when we went out to Al-Madinah, the outcome of the battles between us varied; sometimes we would defeat them and sometimes they would defeat us.’ One night he was later than he usually was, and I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, you have come to us late tonight.’ He said: ‘It occurred to me that I had not read my daily portion of Qur’an and I did not want to come out until I had completed it.’” Aws said: “I asked the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): ‘How did you used to divide up the Qur’an?’ They said: ‘A third, a fifth, a seventh, a ninth, an eleventh, a thirteenth, and Hizbul-Mufassal.’”
1346 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr said:“I memorized the Qur’an and recited it all in one night. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘I am afraid that you may live a long life and that you may get bored. Recite it over the period of a month.’ I said: ‘Let me benefit from my strength in my youth.’ He said: ‘Recite it in ten days.’ I said: ‘Let me benefit from my strength and my youth.’ He said: ‘Recite it in seven days.’ I said: ‘Let me benefit from my strength and my youth,’ but he refused (to alter it any further).”
1347 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“No one properly understands who reads the Qur’an in less than three days.”
1348 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“I did not know of the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) reciting the entire Qur’an until morning.”

1350 | It was narrated that Jasrah bint Dijajah said:“I heard Abu Dharr say: ‘The Prophet (ﷺ) stood reciting a Verse and repeating it until morning came. That Verse was: “If you punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily You, only You, are the All- Mighty, the All-Wise.’”” [5:118]
1351 | It was narrated from Hudhaifah that the Prophet (ﷺ) prayed, and when he recited a Verse which mentioned mercy, he would ask for mercy; when he recited a Verse that mentioned punishment he would pray for deliverance from it; and when he recited a Verse that mentioned the Tanzih of Allah, he would glorify Him.
1352 | It was narrated that Abu Laila said:“I prayed beside the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was praying voluntary prayers at night. He recited a Verse which mentioned punishment and said: ‘I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire, woe to the people of the Fire.’”
1353 | It was narrated that Qatadah said; “I asked Anas bin Malik about the recitation of the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said:‘He used to elongate his voice.’”
1354 | It was narrated that Ghudaif bin Harith said:“I came to ‘Aishah and asked: ‘Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recite Qur’an loudly or softly?’ She said: ‘Sometimes he would recite loud and sometimes softly.’ I said, ‘Allahu Akbar! Praise is to Allah Who has made this matter one of broad scope.’”
1355 | It was narrated that Ibn `Abbas said:“When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed Tahajjud at night, he would say: “Allahumma lakal-hamd, Anta nurus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Wa lakal-hamd, Anta qayyamus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Wa lakal-hamd, Anta malikus- samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Wa lakal-hamd, Antal-haqq, wa wa`duka haqq, wa liqa’uka haqq, wa qawluka haqq, wal-jannatu haqq, wan-naru haqq, was-sa`atu haqq, wan-nabiyyuna haqq, wa Muhammadun haqq.

Antal-muqaddimu wa Antal-muakhkhiru. La ilaha illa anta wa la ilaha ghairuka, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa bika (O Allah, to you is praise, You are the Light of the heavens and the earth, and everyone therein. To You is praise, You are the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth, and everyone therein. To You is praise, You are the Sovereign of the heavens and the earth, and everyone therein. To You is praise, You are the Truth; Your promise is true, the meeting with You is true, Your saying is true, Paradise is true, the Fire is true, the Hour is true, the Prophets are true, and Muhammad (ﷺ) is true. O Allah, to You have I submitted, in You I believe, in You have I put my trust, to You I turn in repentance, by Your help I argue, to You I refer my case, so forgive me for my past and future sins, what I have done in secret and what I have done openly. You are the One Who brings forward and puts back. None has the right to be worshipped but You, and there is none who has the right to be worshipped other than You. And there is no power and no strength except with You.”  Another chain that Ibn `Abbas narrated: “When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood during the night for Tahajjud,” and he mentioned something similar.
1356 | It was narrated that ‘Asim bin Humaid said:“I asked ‘Aishah: ‘With what did the Prophet (ﷺ) start voluntary prayers?’ She said: ‘You have asked me about something which no one has asked before. He used to say Allahu Akbar ten times, and Al-Hamdu Lillah ten times and Subhan Allah ten times, and he would say Allahumma aghfirli wahdini, warzuqni, wa ‘afini (O Allah, forgive me, guide me, grant me provision and give me good health),” and he would seek refuge from the difficulty of the standing on the Day of Resurrection.”
1357 | It was narrated that Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman said:“I asked `Aishah: ‘With what did the Prophet (ﷺ) start his voluntary prayers?’ She said: ‘He would say: “Allahumma Rabba Jibra’il wa Mika’il wa Israfil, Fatiras-samawati wal-ard, `alimal-ghaybi wash- shahadah, Anta tahkumu baina `ibadika fima kanu fihi yakhtalifun, ihdini lima-khtulifa fihi minal-haqqi bi idhnika, innaka latahdi ila siratin mustaqim (O Allah, Lord of Jibra’il, Mika’il and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You judge between Your slaves concerning that wherein they differ. Guide me to the disputed matters of truth by Your Leave, for You are the One Who guides to the straight Path).”  (One of the narrators) `Abdur-Rahman bin `Umar said: “Bear in mind the word Jibra’il with a Hamzah - this is how it was narrated from the Prophet (ﷺ).”
1358 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said, and this is the Hadith of Abu Bakr. “During the period after he finished the ‘Isha’ prayer until the Fajr, the Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray eleven Rak’ah, saying the Salam after each two Rak’ah and praying Witr with one Rak’ah. He would prostrate for as long as it takes anyone of you to recite fifty Verses before he would raise his head. When the Mu’adh-dhin fell silent after the first Adhan for the Subh prayer, he would get up and pray two brief Rak’ah.”
1359 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray thirteen Rak’ah at night.”

1361 | It was narrated that ‘Amir Ash-Sha’bi said:“I asked ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas and ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar about the Prophet’s prayer at night. They said: ‘(He prayed) thirteen Rak’ah, including eight, and three for Witr, and two Rak’ah after the Fajr.’”
1362 | It was narrated that Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani said:“I said, I must observe how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prays tonight. So I lay down at his door. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up and prayed two brief Rak’ah, then two long ones, which were very, very long, then two Rak’ah which were shorter than the ones preceding them, then two Rak’ah which were shorter than the ones preceding them, then two Rak’ah which were shorter than the ones preceding them, then two Rak’ah, then Witr. That was thirteen Rak’ah.”
1363 | It was narrated from Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbas, that Ibn ‘Abbas told him that he slept at the house of Maimunah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), who was his maternal aunt. He said:“I lay down across the pillow and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his wife were laying along it. The Prophet (ﷺ) slept until midnight, or a little before, or a little after. The Prophet (ﷺ) woke up and began to rub the sleep from his face with his hand. Then he recited the last ten Verses of Surah Al ‘Imran. Then he got up and went to a water skin that was hanging up and performed ablution from it, and he performed ablution well, then he stood up and prayed.” ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas said: “I stood up and did what he had done, then I went and stood beside him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) put his right hand on my head, took hold of my right ear and tweaked it. Then he prayed two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then he prayed Witr. Then he lay down until the Mu’adh-dhin came to him and he prayed two brief Rak’ah, then he went out to pray.”
1364 | It was narrated that ‘Amr bin ‘Abasah said:“I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, who became a Muslim with you?’ He said: ‘A free man and a slave.’ I said: ‘Is there any hour of the night that is closer to Allah than another?’ He said: ‘Yes, the last half of the night.’”

Who will call upon Me, that I may answer him? Who will ask My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’ until dawn comes.” Hence they used to prefer voluntary prayers at the end of the night rather than at the beginning.
1367 | It was narrated that Rifa’ah Al-Juhani said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Allah provides respite until, when half or two thirds of the night had passed, He says: “My slave does not ask of anyone other than Me. Whoever calls upon Me, I will answer him; whoever asks of Me, I will give him; whoever asks My forgiveness, I will forgive him,” until dawn comes.’”
1368 | It was narrated that Abu Mas`ud said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever recites the last two Verses of Surat Al-Baqarah at night, that will be sufficient for him.”  In his narration (one of the narrators) Hafs said: “`Abdur-Rahman said: ‘I met Abu Mas`ud when he was performing Tawaf, and he narrated this to me.’”

1370 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘If anyone of you becomes drowsy, let him sleep until he feels refreshed, for he does not know, if he prays when he feels drowsy, he may want to say words seeking forgiveness but (instead) he ends up cursing himself.’”
1371 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered the mosque and saw a rope tied between two pillars. He said, “What is this rope?” They said:“It belongs to Zainab. She prays here and when she gets tired she holds on to it.” He said: “Untie it, untie it; let any one of you pray when he has energy, if he gets tired let him sit down.”
1372 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“When anyone of you gets up to pray at night, and his tongue stumbles over the words of the Qur’an, and he does not know what he is saying, let him lie down.”
1373 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever prays twenty Rak’ah between Maghrib and ‘Isha’, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise.’”
1374 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever prays six Rak’ah after the Maghrib and does not speak evil between them, they will be made equivalent to twelve years’ worship.’”
1375 | It was narrated that ‘Asim bin ‘Amr said:“A group from the people of ‘Iraq came to ‘Umar and when they came to him, he said to them: ‘Where are you from?’ They said: ‘From the inhabitants of ‘Iraq.’ He said: ‘Have you come with permission?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ Then they asked him about a man’s prayer in his house. ‘Umar said: ‘I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: “As for a man’s prayer in his house, it is light, so illuminate your houses.’””  Another chain with similar wording.
1376 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“When anyone of you has finished his prayer, let him give his house a share of that, for Allah will put something good in his house because of that prayer.”
1377 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Do not make your houses into graves.’”
1378 | ‘Abdullah bin Sa’d said:“I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): ‘Which is better prayer in my house or prayer in the mosque?’ He said: ‘Do you not see how close my house is to the mosque?’ But praying in my house is dearer to me than praying in the mosque, apart from the prescribed prayers.’”
1379 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Harith said:“During the caliphate of ‘Uthman, when the people were present in large numbers, I asked about Duha prayer, and I could not find anyone who could tell me that he, meaning the Prophet (ﷺ), had prayed it, apart from Umm Hani’. She told me that he had prayed it with eight Rak’ah.”
1380 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Whoever prays Duha with twelve Rak’ah, Allah will build for him a palace of gold in Paradise.’”
1381 | Mu’adhah Al-‘Adawiyyah said:“I asked ‘Aishah: ‘Did the Prophet (ﷺ) pray Duha?’ She said: ‘Yes; four (Rak’ah) and he would add whatever Allah willed.’”
1382 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever regularly prays two Rak’ah of Duha, his sins will be forgiven even if they are like the foam of the sea.’”
1383 | It was narrated that Jabir bin ‘Abdullah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to teach us Istikharah, just as he used to teach us a Surah of the Qur’an. He said: ‘If anyone of you is deliberating about a decision he has to make, then let him pray two Rak’ah of non- obligatory prayer, then say: Allahumma inni astakhiruka bi ‘ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika wa as’aluka min fadlikal-‘azim, fa innaka taqdiru wa la aqdir, wa ta’lamu wa la a’lam, wa Anta ‘allamul-ghuyub. Allahumma in kunta ta’lamu hadhal-amra (then the matter should be mentioned by name) ma kan min shay’in khairan li fi dini wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri, aw khairanli fi ‘ajili amri wa ajilihi, faqdurhu li wa yassirhu li wa barik li fihi. Wa in kunta ta’lamu [O Allah, I seek Your guidance (in making a choice) by virtue of Your knowledge, and I seek ability by virtue of Your power, and I ask You of Your great bounty. You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not. You are the Knower of hidden things. O Allah, if in Your knowledge, this matter (then it should be mentioned by name) is good for me in my religion, my livelihood and my affairs, or both in this world and in the Hereafter then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge]. Then saying similar to what he said the first time, except: Wa in kana sharran li fasrifhu ‘anni wasrifni ‘anhu waqdur li al-khair haithuma kana thumma raddini bihi (If it is bad for me then turn it away from me and turn me away from it, and ordain for me the good wherever it may be and make me pleased with it).’”
1384 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Abi Awfa Al-Aslami said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out to us and said: ‘Whoever has some need from Allah or from any of His creation, let him perform ablution and pray two Rak’ah, then let him say: La ilaha illallahul-Halimul- Karim. Subhan-Allahi Rabbil-‘arshil-‘azim. Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabbil-‘Alamin. Allahumma inni as’aluka mujibat rahmatika, wa ‘aza’ima maghfiratika, wal-ghanimata min kulli birrin, was-salamata min kulli ithmnin. As’aluka alla tada’a li dhanban illa ghafartahu, wa la hamman illa farrajtahu, wa la hajah hiya laka ridan illa qadaitaha li (None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, the Forbearing, the Most Generous. Glory is to Allah, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Praise is to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. O Allah, I ask You for the means of Your mercy and forgiveness, the benefit of every good deed and safety from all sins. I ask You not to leave any sin of mine but You forgive it, or any distress but You relieve it, or any need that is pleasing to You but You meet it). Then he should ask Allah for whatever he wants in this world and in the Hereafter, for it is decreed.”
1385 | It was narrated from ‘Uthman bin Hunaif that a blind man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said:“Pray to Allah to heal me.” He said: “If you wish to store your reward for the Hereafter, that is better, or if you wish, I will supplicate for you.” He said: “Supplicate.” So he told him to perform ablution and do it well, and to pray two Rak’ah, and to say this supplication: “Allahumma inni as’aluka wa atawajjahu ilaika bimuhammadin nabiyyir-rahmah. Ya Muhammadu inni qad tawajjahtu bika ila rabbi fi hajati hadhihi lituqda. Allahumma fashaffi’hu fiya (O Allah, I ask of You and I turn my face towards You by virtue of the intercession of Muhammad the Prophet of mercy. O Muhammad, I have turned to my Lord by virtue of your intercession concerning this need of mine so that it may be met. O Allah, accept his intercession concerning me)”.
1386 | It was narrated that Abu Rafi’ said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to ‘Abbas: ‘O uncle, shall I not give you a gift, shall I not benefit you, shall I not uphold my ties of kinship with you?’ He said: ‘Of course, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘Pray four Rak’ah, and recite in each Rak’ah the Opening of the Book (Al-Fatihah) and a Surah. When you have finished reciting, say: Subhan-Allah wal-hamdu Lillah wa la ilaha illallah wa Allahu Akbar (Glory is to Allah, praise is to Allah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Allah is the Most Great) fifteen times before you bow in Ruku’. Then bow and say it ten times; then raise your head and say it ten times; then prostrate and say it ten times; then raise your head and say it ten times; then prostrate and say it ten times; then raise your head and say it ten times before you stand up. That wil be seventy-five times in each Rak’ah and three hundred times in the four Rak’ah, and even if your sins are like the grains of sand, Allah will forgive you for them.’ He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what if someone cannot say it in one day?’ He said: ‘Then say it once in a week; if you cannot, then say it once in a month’ until he said: ‘Once in a year.’”
1387 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib: ‘O ‘Abbas, O my uncle, shall I not give you a gift, shall I not give you something, shall I not tell you of something which, if you do it, will expiate for ten types of sins? If you do them, Allah will forgive you your sins, the first and the last of them, the old and the new, the unintentional and the deliberate, the minor and the major, the secret and the open, ten types of sin. Pray four Rak’ah, and recite in each Rak’ah the Opening of the Book (Al-Fatihah) and a Surah. When you have finished reciting in the first Rak’ah, while you are standing, say: Subhan-Allah wal- hamdu Lillah wa la ilaha illallah wa Allahu Akbar (Glory if to Allah, praise is to Allah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Allah is the Most Great) fifteen times. Then bow and say it ten times while you are bowing. Then raise your head from Ruku’ and say it ten times. Then go into prostration and say it ten times while you are prostrating. Then raise your head from prostration and say it ten times. Then prostrate and say it ten times. Then raise your head from prostration and say it ten times. That will be seventy-five times in each Rak’ah. Do that in all four Rak’ah. If you can pray it once each day then do so. If you cannot, then once each week; if you cannot, then once each month. If you cannot, then once in your lifetime.’”
1388 | It was narrated that ‘Ali bin Abu Talib said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘When it is the night of the middle of Sha’ban, spend its night in prayer and observe a fast on that day. For Allah descends at sunset on that night to the lowest heaven and says: ‘Is there no one who will ask Me for forgiveness, that I may forgive him? Is there no one who will ask Me for provision, that I may provide for him? Is there no one who is afflicted by trouble, that I may relieve him?’ And so on, until dawn comes.’”
1389 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“I missed the Prophet (ﷺ) one night, so I went out looking for him. I found him at Al-Baqi’, raising his head towards the sky. He said: ‘O ‘Aishah, were you afraid that Allah and His Messenger would wrong you?’” She said: “I said: ‘No, it is not that, but I thought that you had gone to one of your other wives.’ He said: ‘Allah descends on the night of the middle of Sha’ban to the lowest heaven, and He forgives more than the numbers of hairs on the sheep of Banu Kalb.’”
1390 | It was narrated from Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Allah looks down on the night of the middle of Sha’ban and forgives all His creation, apart from the idolater and the Mushahin.”  Another chain from Abu Musa, from the Prophet (ﷺ) with similar wording.

1395 | It was narrated that ‘Ali bin Abu Talib said:“If I heard a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), Allah benefitted me with it as much as He willed, and if I heard it from anyone else, I would ask him to swear me an oath, then if he swore an oath I would believe him. Abu Bakr told me and Abu Bakr spoke the truth that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘There is no man who commits a sin then he performs ablution and does it well, then he prays two Rak’ah,’ (one of the narrators) Mis’ar said: ‘then performs prayer and seeks the forgiveness of Allah, but Allah will forgive him.’
1396 | It was narrated from ‘Asim bin Sufyan Thaqafi that they went on the campaign of Salasil, but no battle took place; they only took up their positions. Then they came back to Mu’awiyah, and Abu Ayyub and ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir were with him. ‘Asim said:“O Abu Ayyub, we have missed out on Jihad this year, and we were told that whoever prays in the four mosques will be forgiven his sins.” He said: “O son of my brother, shall I not tell you of something easier than that? I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Whoever performs ablution as he has been commanded, and prays as he has been commanded, will be forgiven his previous (bad) deeds.’” He said: “(Did he not say it) like that, O ‘Uqbah?” He said: “Yes.”
1397 | ‘Uthman said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Do you think that if there was a river in the courtyard of anyone of you, and he bathed in it five times each day, would there be any dirt left on him?’ They said: ‘(There would be) nothing.’ He said: ‘Prayer takes away sins like water takes away dirt.’”
1398 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud that a man did something with a woman that was less than adultery; I do not know how far it went, but it was less than adultery. He went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and told him about that. Then Allah revealed the words:“And perform the prayer, at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful.” [11:114] He said: “O Messenger of Allah, is this only for me?” He said: “It is for everyone who acts upon it.”
1399 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Allah enjoined fifty prayers upon my nation, and I came back with that until I came to Musa. Musa said: ‘What has your Lord enjoined upon your nation?’ I said: ‘He has enjoined fifty prayers on me.’ He said: ‘Go back to your Lord, for your nation will not be able to do that.’ So I went back to my Lord, and He reduced it by half. I went back to Musa and told him, and he said: ‘Go back to your Lord, for your nation will not be able to do that.’ So I went back to my Lord, and He said: ‘They are five and they are fifty; My Word does not change.’ So I went back to Musa and he said: ‘Go back to your Lord.’ I said: ‘I feel shy before my Lord.’”
1400 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“Your Prophet (ﷺ) was enjoined to do fifty prayers but he returned to your Lord to make (i.e., reduce) them to five prayers.”
1401 | It was narrated that ‘Ubadah bin Samit said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Five prayers that Allah has enjoined upon His slaves, so whoever does them, and does not omit anything out of negligence, on the Day of Resurrection Allah will make a covenant with him that He will admit him to Paradise. But whoever does them but omits something from them out of negligence, will not have such a covenant with Allah; if He wills He will punish him, and if He wills, He will forgive him.’”
1402 | It was narrated from Sharik bin ‘Abdullah bin Abu Namir that he heard Anas bin Malik say:“While we were sitting in the mosque, a man entered riding a camel; he made it kneel in the mosque, then he hobbled it and said to them: ‘Which of you is Muhammad?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was reclining among them, so they said: ‘This fair- skinned man who is reclining.’ The man said to him: ‘O son of ‘Abdul- Muttalib!’ The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘I am listening to you.’ The man said: O Muhammad! I am asking you and will be stern in asking, so do not bear any ill-feelings towards me.’ He said: ‘Ask whatever you think.’ The man said: ‘I adjure you by your Lord and the Lord of those who came before you, has Allah sent you to all of mankind?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘By Allah, yes.; He said: ‘I adjure you by Allah, has Allah commanded you to pray the five prayers each day and night?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘By Allah, yes.’ He said: ‘I adjure you by Allah, has Allah commanded you to fast this month of each year?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘By Allah, yes.’ He said: ‘I adjure you by Allah, has Allah commanded you to take this charity from our rich and distribute it among our poor?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘By Allah, yes.’ The man said: ‘I believe in what you have brought, and I am the envoy of my people who are behind me. I am Dimam bin Tha’labah, the brother of Banu Sa’d bin Bakr.’”
1403 | Sa’eed bin Musayyab said that Abu Qatadah bin Rib’i told him that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Allah said: ‘I have enjoined on your nation five prayers, and I have made a covenant with Myself that whoever maintains them, I will admit them to Paradise, and whoever does not maintain them, has no such covenant with Me.’”
1404 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“One prayer in this mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers anywhere else, except The Sacred Mosque (Al-Masjid Al-Haram).”  (Another chain) from Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ) with similar wording.

1407 | It was narrated that Maimunah the freed (female) slave of the Prophet (ﷺ) said:I said: “O Messenger of Allah, tell us about Baitil- Maqdis.” He said: “It is the land of the Resurrection and the Gathering. Go and pray there, for one prayer there is like one thousand prayers elsewhere.” I said: “What if I cannot travel and go there?” He said: “Then send a gift of oil to light its lamps, for whoever does that is like one who goes there.”

A man from among his Companions said: ‘Would you like us to make you something upon which you can stand on Fridays so that the people will be able to see you and hear your sermon?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ So he made three steps for him, as a pulpit. When they put the pulpit in place, they put it in the place where it stands now. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wanted to stand on the pulpit, he passed by the tree trunk from which he used to deliver the sermon, and when he went beyond the trunk, it moaned and split and cracked. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came down when he heard the voice of the trunk, and rubbed it with his hand until it fell silent. Then he went back to the pulpit and when he prayed, he prayed facing it. When the mosque was knocked down (for renovation) and (the pillars, etc.) were changed, Ubayy bin Ka’b took that trunk and kept it in his house until it became very old and the termites consumed it and it became grains of dust.”

It was made by so-and-so, the freed slave of so- and-so (a woman), (who was) a carpenter. He brought it and he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) stood on it when it was put in position. He faced the Qiblah and the people stood behind him. He recited Qur’an, then bowed and raised his head, then he moved backwards until he prostrated on the ground, then he went back to the pulpit and recited Qur’an, then bowed and raised his head, then he moved backwards until he prostrated on the ground.”

Everything has an appointed time with Him, so be patient and seek reward.’ But she sent for him again, adjuring him to come. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up, and I got up with him, as did Mu’adh bin Jabal, Ubayy bin Ka’b and ‘Ubadah bin Samit. When we entered they handed the child to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and his soul was rattling in his chest.” I think he was that it was like a water skin. “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wept, and ‘Ubadah bin Samit said to him: ‘What is this, O Messenger of Allah?’ He said: ‘It is compassion which Allah has created in the son of Adam.

Were you really like that?’” Asid said: "I said: 'Subhan-Allah! Allah says: "And no bearer of burdens shall another's burden (35:18)."

Allahumma indaka ahtasabtu musibati, fajurni fiha, wa ‘awwidni minha (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. O Allah, with You I seek reward for my calamity, so reward me for it and compensate me),’ but Allah will reward him for that and compensate him with something better than it.” She said: “When Abu Salamah died, I remembered what he had told me from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I said: ‘Inna lillahi, wa inna ilayhi raji’un. Allahumma indaka ahtasabtu musibati, fajurni alaiha (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. O Allah, with You I seek reward for my calamity, so reward me for it).’ But when I wanted to say wa ‘awwidni minha (and compensate me with better), I said to myself: ‘How can I be compensated with something better than Abu Salamah?’ Then I said it, and Allah compensated me with Muhammad (ﷺ) and rewarded me for my calamity.”
1599 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) opened a door that was between him and the people or drew back a curtain and he saw the people praying behind Abu Bakr.

1600 | It was narrated from Fatimah bint Husain that her father said:The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Whoever was stricken with a calamity and when he remembers it he says ‘Inna lillahi, wa inna ilayhi raji’un (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return),’ even though it happened a long time ago, Allah will record for him a reward like that of the day it befell him.”
1601 | Qais, Abu ‘Umarah, the freed slave of the Ansar, said:“I heard ‘Abdullah bin Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin ‘Amr bin Hazm narrating from his father, from his grandfather, that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘There is no believer who consoles for his brother for a calamity, but Allah will clothe him with garments of honor on the Day of Resurrection.’”

It will be said: “O fetus who pleads with your Lord! Admit your parents to Paradise.” So he will drag them out with his umbilical cord until he admits them to Paradise.’”
1609 | It was narrated from Mu’adh bin Jabal that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! The miscarried fetus will drag his mother by his umbilical cord to Paradise, if she (was patient and) sought reward (for her loss).”
1610 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Ja’far said:“When news of the death of Ja’far was brought, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Prepare food for the family of Ja’far, for there has come to them that which is keeping them busy or something which is keeping them busy.”
1611 | Asma’ bint ‘Umais said:“When Ja’far was killed, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went to his family and said: ‘The family of Ja’far are busy with the matter of their deceased, so prepare food for them.’”  (One of the narrators) Abdullah said: "That continued to be the Sunnah, until innovations were introduced, then it was abandoned."

1614 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr said:“A man died in Al- Madinah, and he was one of those who were born in Al-Madinah. The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the funeral prayer for him and said: “Would that he had died somewhere other than his birthplace.” A man among the people said: “Why, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “If a man dies somewhere other than his birthplace, a space will be measured for him in Paradise (as big as the distance) from the place where he was born to the place where he died.”
1615 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever dies from a sickness dies as a martyr. He is protected from the torment of the grave and he is granted provision from Paradise morning and evening.”
1616 | It was narrated from ‘Aishah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Breaking the bones of the deceased is like breaking his bones when he is alive.”
1617 | It was narrated from Umm Salamah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Breaking the bones of the deceased is, in sin, like breaking his bones when he is alive.”
1618 | It was narrated that ‘Ubaidullah bin ‘Abdullah said:“I asked ‘Aishah: ‘O mother! Tell me about the sickness of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ She said: ‘He felt pain and started to spit (over his body), and we began to compare his spittle to the spittle of a person eating raisins. Like a person eating raisins and spitting out the seeds. He used to go around among his wives, but when he became ill, he asked them permission to stay in the house of ‘Aishah and that they should come to him in turns.’ She said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered upon me, (supported) between two men, with his feet making lines along the ground. One of them was ‘Abbas.’ I told Ibn ‘Abbas this Hadith and he said: ‘Do you know who the other man was whom ‘Aishah did not name? He was ‘Ali bin Abu Talib.’”
1619 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) used to seek refuge using the following words: ‘Adhhibil-ba’s, Rabbin-nas, washfi Antash-shafi, la shifa’a illa shifa’uka, shifa’an la yughadiru saqaman (Take away the affliction, O Lord of mankind, and grant healing, for You are the Healer and there is no healing that leaves no sickness).’ When the Prophet (ﷺ) fell sick with the sickness that would be his last, I took his hand and wiped it over his body and recited these words. He withdrew his hand from mine and said: ‘O Allah, forgive me and let me meet the exalted companions (i.e., those who occupy high positions in Paradise).’ Those were the last words of his that I heard.”
1620 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘There is no Prophet who fell sick but he was given the choice between this world and the Hereafter.’ She said: ‘When he became sick with the illness that would be his last, (his voice) became hoarse and I heard him say, “In the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets, the true believers, the martyrs, and the righteous.’” [4:69] Then I knew that he had been given the choice.”
1621 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) gathered together and not one of them lagged behind. Fatimah came, and her gait was like that of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said, ‘Welcome to my daughter.’ Then he made her sit to his left, and he whispered something to her, and she smiled. I said to her: ‘What made you weep?’ She said: ‘I will not disclose the secret of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ I said: ‘I never saw joy so close to grief as I saw today.’ When she wept I said: ‘Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) tell you some special words that were not for us, then you wept?’ And I asked her about what he had said. She said: ‘I will not disclose the secret of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ After he died I asked her what he had said, and she said: ‘He told me that Jibra’il used to review the Qur’an with him once each year, but he had reviewed it with him twice that year, (and he said:) “I do not think but that my time is near. You will be the first of my family to join me, and what a good predecessor I am for you.” So I wept. Then he whispered to me and said: “Will you not be pleased to be the leader of the women of this Ummah?” So I smiled.’”
1622 | ‘Aishah said:“I never saw anyone suffer more pain than the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).”
1623 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he was dying, and there was a bowl of water next to him. He put his hand in the vessel and wiped his face with the water, and said: ‘O Allah, help me to bear the agonies of death.’”
1624 | It was narrated that Zuhri heard Anas bin Malik say:“The last glance that I had of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was when he drew back the curtain on Monday, and I saw his face as if it was a page of the Mushaf (Qur’an), and the people were praying behind Abu Bakr. He (Abu Bakr) wanted to move, but he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) gestured to him to stand firm. Then he let the curtain fall, and he died at the end of that day.”
1625 | It was narrated from Umm Salamah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say, during the illness that would be his last:“The prayer, and those whom your hands possess.”* And he kept on saying it until his tongue could no longer utter any words.
1626 | It was narrated that Aswad said:“They said in ‘Aishah’s presence that ‘Ali was appointed (by the Prophet (ﷺ) before he died), and she said: ‘When was he appointed? He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) was resting against my bosom, or in my lap, and he called for a basin, then he became limp in my lap and died, and I did not realize it. So when did he (ﷺ) appoint him?’”
1627 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed away, Abu Bakr was with his wife, the daughter of Kharijah, in villages surrounding Al-Madinah. They started to say: ‘The Prophet (ﷺ) has not died, rather he has been overcome with what used to overcome him at the time of Revelation.’ Then Abu Bakr came and uncovered his (the Prophet’s (ﷺ)) face, kissed him between the eyes and said: ‘You are too noble before Allah for Him to cause you to die twice. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has indeed died.’ ‘Umar was in a corner of the mosque saying: ‘By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has not died and he will never die until the hands and feet of most of the hypocrites are cut off.’ Then Abu Bakr stood up, ascended the pulpit and said: ‘Whoever used to worship Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Whoever used to worship Muhammad, Muhammad is dead. “Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; and Allah will give reward to those who are grateful.’” [3:144] ‘Umar said: ‘It was as if I had never read (that Verse) before that day.’”
1628 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“When they wanted to dig a grave for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), they sent for Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Jarrah, who used to dig graves in the manner of the people of Makkah, and they sent for Abu Talhah, who used to dig graves for the people of Al-Madinah, and he used to make a niche in the grave. They sent two messengers to both of them, and they said: ‘O Allah, choose what is best for Your Messenger.’ They found Abu Talhah and brought him, but they did not find Abu ‘Ubaidah. So he dug a grave with a niche for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When they had finished preparing him, on Tuesday, he was placed on his bed in his house. Then the people entered upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in groups and offered the funeral prayer for him, and when they finished the women entered, and when they finished the children entered, and no one led the people in offering the funeral prayer for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Muslims differed concerning the place where he should be buried. Some said that he should be buried in his mosque. Others said that he should be buried with his Companions. Then Abu Bakr said: ‘I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “No Prophet ever passed away but he was buried where he died.” So they lifted up the bed of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on which he had died, and dug the grave for him, then he (ﷺ) was buried in the middle of Tuesday night. ‘Ali bin Abu Talib, Fadl bin ‘Abbas and his brother Qutham, and Shuqran the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went down in his grave. Aws bin Khawli, who was Abu Laila, said to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib: ‘I adjure you by Allah! Give us our share of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ So ‘Ali said to him: ‘Come down.’ Shuqran, his freed slave, had taken a Qatifah which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to wear. He buried it in his grave and said, ‘By Allah, no one will ever wear it after you.’ So it was buried with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).”
1629 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:“When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) suffered the agonies of death that he suffered, Fatimah said: ‘O my father, what a severe agony!’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Your father will suffer no more agony after this day. There has come to your father that which no one can avoid, the death that everyone will encounter until the Day of Resurrection.’”
1630 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:“Fatimah said to me: ‘O Anas, how did you manage to scatter dust on the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?’” And Thabit narrated to us from Anas that Fatimah said: “When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed away: ‘O my father! To Jibra’il we announce his death; O my father, how much closer he is now to his Lord; O my father, the Paradise of Firdaws is his abode; O my father, he has answered the call of his Lord.”  (One of the narrators) Hammad said: "I saw Thabit, when he narrated this Hadith, weeping until I could see his ribs moving up and down."
1631 | It was narrated that Anas said:“On the day when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered Al-Madinah, everything was lit up, and on the day when he died, everything went dark, and no sooner had we dusted off our hands (after burying him) but we felt that our hearts had changed.”*
1632 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“We used to be guarded in our speech even with our wives at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), fearing that Qur’an may be revealed amongst us, but when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, we began to speak freely.”
1633 | It was narrated that Ubayy bin Ka’b said:“We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we all had a single focus, but when he passed away we started to look here and there (i.e., have different interests).”
1634 | It was narrated that Umm Salamah bint Abi Umayyah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), said:“At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), if a person stood to pray, his gaze would not go beyond his feet. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, if a person stood to pray, his gaze would not go beyond the place where he put his forehead when prostrating. Then Abu Bakr died and it was ‘Umar (the caliph). So, when any person stood to pray his gaze would not go beyond the Qiblah. Then came the time of ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan, and there was Fitnah (tribulation, turmoil), and the people started to look right and left.”
1635 | It was narrated that Anas said:“After the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had died, Abu Bakr said to ‘Umar: ‘Let us go and visit Umm Ayman as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to visit her.’ He said: ‘When we reached her she wept.’ They said: ‘Why are you weeping? What is with Allah is better for His Messenger.’ She said: ‘I know that what is with Allah is better for His Messenger, but I am weeping because the Revelation from heaven has ceased.’ She moved them to tears and they started to weep with her.”
1636 | It was narrated from Aws bin Aws that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘The best of your days is Friday. On it Adam was created; on it shall be the Nafakhah,* on it all creation will swoon. So send a great deal of blessing upon me on this day, for your blessing will be presented to me.’ A man said: “O Messenger of Allah! How will our blessing be presented to you when you have disintegrated?” He said: “Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets.”
1637 | It was narrated from Abu Darda’ that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Send a great deal of blessing upon me on Fridays, for it is witnessed by the angels. No one sends blessing upon me but his blessing will be presented to me, until he finishes them.” A man said: “Even after death?” He said: “Even after death, for Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets, so the Prophet of Allah is alive and receives provision.’”
1638 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Every good deed of the son of Adam will be multiplied manifold. A good deed will be multiplied ten times up to as many as seven hundred times, or as much as Allah wills. Allah says: ‘Except for fasting, which is for Me and I shall reward for it. He gives up his desire and his food for My sake.’ The fasting person has two joys, one when he breaks his fast and another when he meets his Lord. The smell that comes from the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allah than the fragrance of musk.”
1639 | Mutarrif, from the tribe of Banu ‘Amir bin Sa’sa’ah narrated that ‘Uthman bin Abul-‘As Ath-Thaqafi invited him to drink some milk that he poured for him. Mutarrif said:“I am fasting.” ‘Uthman said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Fasting is a shield against the Fire just like the shield of anyone of you against fighting.’”
1640 | It was narrated from Sahl bin Sa’d that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“In Paradise there is a gate called Rayyan. On the Day of Resurrection the call will go out saying: ‘Where are those who used to fast?’ Whoever is among those who used to fast will enter it, and whoever enters it will never experience thirst again.”
1641 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘Whoever fasts Ramadan out of faith and the hope of reward will be forgiven his previous sins.”
1642 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When the first night of Ramadan comes, the satans and mischievous jinns are chained up, and the gates of the Fire are closed, and none of its gates are opened. The gates of Paradise are opened and none of its gates are closed. And a caller cries out: ‘O seeker of good, proceed, O seeker of evil, stop.’ And Allah has necks (people) whom He frees (from the Fire), and that happens every day.”
1643 | It was narrated from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“At every breaking of the fast Allah has people whom He frees (from the Fire), and that happens every night.”
1644 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:“Ramadan began, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘This month has come to you, and in it there is a night that is better than a thousand months. Whoever is deprived of it is deprived of all goodness, and no one is deprived of its goodness except one who is truly deprived.’”
1645 | It was narrated that Silah bin Zufar said:“We were with ‘Ammar on the day concerning which there was some doubt. A (roasted) sheep was brought and some of the people moved away. ‘Ammar said: ‘Whoever is fasting on this day has disobeyed Abu Qasim (ﷺ).’”
1646 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade anticipating the fast by fasting one day before sighting (of the crescent).”
1647 | It was narrated from Qasim Abu ‘Abdur-Rahman that he heard Mu’awiyah bin Abu Sufyan on the pulpit saying:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say from the pulpit, before the month of Ramadan: ‘Fasting will begin on such and such a day, but we are going to start fasting earlier, so whoever wants to start fasting earlier (i.e., in Sha’ban), let him do so, and whoever wants to wait until Ramadan begins, let him do so.’”
1648 | It was narrated that Umm Salamah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to join Sha’ban to Ramadan.”
1649 | It was narrated that Rabi’ah bin Ghaz asked ‘Aishah about the fasting of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said:“He used to fast all of Sha’ban, until he joined it to Ramadan.”
1650 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before, except for a man who has a habitual pattern of fasting, in which case let him fast.”
1651 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘When it is the middle of Sha’ban, do not fast until Ramadan comes.”
1652 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“A Bedouin came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘I have seen the new crescent tonight.’ He said: ‘Do you bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Get up, O Bilal, and announce to the people that they should fast tomorrow.’”   Abu 'Ali said: "This is how it was narrated from Walid bin Abu Thawr and Hasan bin 'Ali. It was also narrated from Hammad bin Salamah, but he did not mention Ibn 'Abbas. He said: 'And he announced that they should perform the prayer and that they should fast.'"
1653 | It was narrated that ‘Umair bin Anas bin Malik said:“My paternal uncles among the Ansar who were among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told me: ‘The new crescent of Shawwal was covered with clouds, so we fasted the next day. Then some riders came at the end of the day and testified to the Prophet (ﷺ) that they had seen the new crescent the night before. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded them to break their fast and to go out to offer the ‘Eid prayer the following morning.’”
1654 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘When you see the new crescent, fast, and when you see it, stop fasting. If it is cloudy then calculate it (as thirty days).” Ibn ‘Umar used to fast one day before the new crescent was seen.
1655 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When you see the new crescent then fast, and when you see it then stop fasting. If it is cloudy then fast thirty days.”
1656 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘How much of the month has passed?” We said: “Twenty-two (days), and there are eight left.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “The month is like that, and the month is like that, (and the month is like that), three times, and he withheld one finger the last time.”
1657 | It was narrated from Muhammad bin Sa’d bin Abu Waqqas that his father said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘The month is like that and like that and like that,’ and he showed nine fingers on the third time to indicate twenty-nine.”

1666 | It was narrated from ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The one who fasts Ramadan while traveling is like one who breaks his fast when not traveling.”   Abu Ishaq said: "This Hadith is of no significance."
1667 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that a man from the tribe of Banu ‘Abdul-Ashhal, while (one narrator) ‘Ali bin Muhammad said (he was) a man from the tribe of Banu ‘Abdullah bin Ka’b, said:“The cavalry of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) attacked us, so I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while he was eating a meal. He said: ‘Come and eat.’ I said: ‘I am fasting.’ He said: ‘Sit down and I will tell you about fasting. Allah has relieved the traveler of half of the prayer, and He has relieved the traveler, the pregnant, and the nursing mothers of the duty to fast.’ By Allah, the Prophet (ﷺ) said them, both, or one of them, and now I feel so disappointed that I had not eaten of the food of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).”

The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Go and give this in charity.’ He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, by the One Who sent you with the truth, there is no household between its two lava fields (i.e., in Al-Madinah) that is more in need of it than us.’ He said: ‘Then go and feed your family.’”   Another chain from Abu Hurairah with additional words: "Then he (the Prophet SAW) said: "And fast a day in its place."

1696 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The Adhan of Bilal should not prevent anyone of you from eating Suhur, for he gives the Adhan to alert those among you who are asleep, and so that anyone who is praying can prepare himself for fasting. The Fajr does not come in this manner, rather it comes in this manner, and it appears along the horizon.”

1702 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr Al-Qari said:“I heard Abu hurairah say: ‘No, by the Lord of the Ka’bah! I did not say: “Whoever wakes up in a state of sexual impurity (and wants to fast) then he must not fast.” Muhammad (ﷺ) said it.’”
1703 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) used to spend the night in a state of sexual impurity, then Bilal would come to him and inform him that it is time for prayer. So he would get up and have a bath, and I would see the water dripping from his head, then he would go out and I would hear his voice during Fajr prayer.”   (One of the narrators) Mutarrif said: "I said to Amir: 'Was that during Ramadan?' He said: 'In Ramadan and at other times.'"

1708 | It was narrated from Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever fasts three days in every month, that is fasting for a lifetime.” Then, in testimony of that, Allah revealed: “Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten time the like thereof to his credit.” [6:160] So one day is equivalent to ten (in reward).
1709 | It was narrated from Mu’adhah Al-‘Adawiyyah that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to fast three days of each month.” I said: “Which were they?” She said: “He did not care which days they were.”

What about a person who fasts two days and does not fast one day?’ He said: ‘Is anyone able to do that?’ He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! What about a person who fasts one day and not the next?’ He said: ‘That is the fast of Dawud.’ He said: ‘What about a man who fasts one day and does not fast the next two days?’ He said: ‘I wish that I were given the ability to do that.’”

If they obey that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined upon them charity (Zakat) from their wealth, to be taken from the rich and given to their poor.

Every time the of them has passed, the first of them will come back to him, until judgment is passed upon the people.”
1786 | 'Abu Hurairah narrated that:the Messenger of Allah said: “The camels on which the dues (i.e. Zakat) were not paid will come, trampling their owners with their hooves. And cattle and sheep will come and trample at their owners with their hooves and butt them with their horns, And hoarded treasure will come in the form of a bald-headed snale, and will meet its owner on the Day of Resurrection. Its owner will flee from it two time, then it will come to him and he will flee again, and will say: 'What do I have to do with you?' and it will say: 'I am your hoarded treasure, I am your hoarded treasure.' He will try to shield himself with this hand and it will devour it.”

Ibn Umar Said to him: 'The one who hoards it and does not pay Zakat due on it, woe to him. But this was before the (ruling on) Zakat was revealed. When it was revealed, Allah made it a purification of wealth.' Then he turned away and said: 'I do not mind if I have the (the equivalent of) Uhud in gold, provided that I know how much it is and I pay Zakat on it, and I use it in obedience of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime'”

For twenty five, a Bint Makhad(a one year old she-camel), up to thirty-five; if there is no Bint Makhad, then a Bin Labun ( a two-year-old male camel). If there are more than thirty-five even one, then a Bint Labun ( a two-year-old she-camel) must be given up to forty-five.

This is the obligation of Sadaqah which the Messenger of Allah enjoined upon the Muslims, as Allah commanded the Messenger of Allah. The ages of camels to be given (in Zakat) may be made up in sheep. So if a man has camels on which the Sadaqah is a Jadha'ah (a four-year-old she-camel) and he does not have a Jadha'ah but he has a Hiqqah (a three year old she-camel), then the Hiqqah should be accepted from him, and two sheep should be given (in addition), if they are readily available, or twenty Dirham. If a man has camels on which the Sadaqah is a Hiqqah, and he only has a Bin Labun( a two-year-old she-camel), then the Bint Labun should be accepted from him, along with two sheep or twenty Dirhams.If a man has camels on which the sadaqah is a Bint Labun, and he does not have one, but he has a Hiqqah, then it should be accepted from him, and the Zakat collector should give him back twenty Dirham or two sheep. If a man has camels on which Sadaqah is a Bint Labun, and he does not have one, but he has a Bint Makhad(a one-year-old she-camel), then the Bint Makhad should be accepted from him, along with twenty Dirham or two sheep. If a man has camels on which the Sadaqah is a Bint Makhad, and he does not have one, but he has a Bint Labun, then the Bint Labun should be accepted from him, and the Zakat collector should give him back twenty Dirhams or two sheep. Whoever does not have a Bint Makhad, but he has a Bint Labun (a two-year-old male camel), then it should be accepted from him and nothing else should be given along with it.' ”
1801 | It was narrated that:Suwaid bin Ghafalah said: ”The Zakah collector of the Prophet came to us, and I took him by the hand and read in his order: 'Do not gather separate herds and do not separate herd for fear of Sadaqah'.

If there is more than that - even one - then two sheep, up to two hundred, If there is one more than that - even one = then three sheep, up to three hundred. If there are many sheep, then for each hundred, one sheep.' And I read in it: 'Separate flocks should not be combined, and a combined flock should not be separated.' And I read in it: 'And a male goat should not be taken for Sadaqah, nor a decrepit nor defective animal.' ”
1806 | Ibn Umar narrated that:the Messenger of Allah said: “The Sadaqah of Muslims should be taken at their watering places.”
1807 | Ibn Umar narrated that:the Messenger of Allah said: “For forty sheep, one sheep up to one hundred and twenty. If there is one more. Then two sheep, up to two hundred.

Do not separate combined flock and do not combine separate flocks for fear of Sadaqah. Each partner (who has a share in the flock) should pay in proportion to his shares. And the Zakat collector should not accept any decrepit or defective animal, nor any male goat, unless he wishes to.”

We took it from where we used to take it at the time of the Messenger of Allah, and we distributed it where we used to distribute it.' ”

The people of Khaibar said to him: “We know the land better, so give it to us so that we may work the land, and you will have half of its produce and we will have half.” He maintained that, he gave it to them on that basis. When the time for the date harvest came, he sent Ibn Rawahah to them. He assesses the date palms, and he said: “For this tree, such and such (amount).” They said: “You are demanding too much of us, O Ibn Rawahah!” He said: “This is my assessment and I will give you half of what I say.” They said: “This is fair, and fairness is what haven and earth are based on.” They said: “We Agree to take (accept) what you say.”
1821 | It was narrated that:Awf bin Malik Al-Ashja'i said: “The Messenger of Allah went out, and a man had hung up one or more bunches of dates. He (the Prophet) had a stick in his hand and he started hitting that bunch of dates repeatedly, saying: 'If the owner of these dates wanted to give in charity, he should have given something better than these. The owner of this charity will eat rotten and shriveled dates on the Day of Resurrection.' ”

At the time of the new date-palm harvest, they would take a bunch of dates that were beginning to ripen and hang it on a rope between two of the pillars in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the poor emigrants would eat from it.” One of them deliberately mixed a bunch containing rotten and shriveled dates, and thought this was permissible because of the large number of dates that had been put there. So the following was revealed about the one who did that: '… and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it'. Meaning do not seek out the rotten and shriveled dates to give in charity: '…(thought) you would not accept it save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein.' Meaning, if you were given this as a gift you would only accept it because you felt embarrassed, and you would get angry that he had sent something of which you have no need. And know that Allah has no need of your charity.”
1823 | It was narrated that:Abu Sayyarah Al-Muta said: “I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! I have bees.' He said: 'Give one-tenth.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah!' Protect it for me.' And he protected it for me.”

If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.' ”

'Asim asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about that, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) disapproved of the question. Then 'Uwaimir met him ('Asim) and asked him about that, saying: 'What did you do?’ He said: I did that and you have not brought me any good. I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he disapproved of this question.’ Uwaimir said: 'By Allah, I will go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) myself and ask him.' So he went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and found that Qur'an had been revealed concerning them, and the Prophet (ﷺ) told them to go through the procedure of Li'an. 'Uwaimir said: 'O Messenger of Allah, (ﷺ) by Allah if I take her back, I would have been telling lies about her.' So he left her before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told him to do so, and that became the Sunnah for two who engage in the procedure of Li'an. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child who is black in color with widely-spaced dark eyes and large buttocks, then I think that he was telling the truth about her, but if she gives birth to a child with a red complexion like a Wahrah,[1] then I think that he was lying.'

Then the following was revealed: "And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies (i.e., testifies four times) by Allah that he is one of those who speak the truth. And the fifth (testimony should be) the invoking of the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie (against her). But it shall avert the punishment (of stoning to death) from her, it she bears witness four times by Allah, that he (her husband) is telling a lie. And the fifth (testimony) should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth." The Prophet (ﷺ), turned and sent for them, and they came. Hilal bin Umayyah stood up and bore witness, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: "Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will either of you repent?" Then she stood up and affirmed her innocence. On the fifth time, meaning that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth, they said to her: "It will invoke the wrath of Allah." Ibn 'Abbas said: "She hesitated and backed up, until we thought that she was going to recant. Then she said: 'By Allah, I cannot dishonor my people for ever.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child with black eyes, fleshy buttocks and big calves, then he is the son of Sharik bin Sahma'.' And she gave birth to such a child.

2450 | It was narrated that 'Amr bin Dinar said:“I heard Ibn 'Umar say: 'We used to lend land for cultivation in return for a share of the harvest, and we did not see anything wrong with that, until we heard Rafi' bin Khadij say: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade it.” Then we stopped because of what he said.' ”
2451 | 'Ata' said:“I heard Jabir bin 'Abdullah say: Some men among us had extra land which they would rent out for one third or one quarter (of the crop). The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Whoever has extra land, let him cultivate it (himself) or let him give it to his brother (for free, to cultivate it), and if he does not want to do that, let him keep his land.”
2452 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever has land, let him cultivate it (himself) or let him give it to his brother (for free, to cultivate it), and if he does not want to do that, let him keep his land.”
2453 | It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that:he used to lease out some land that belonged to him, for cultivation. Then someone came to him and told him that Rafi' bin Khadij said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had forbidden leasing out land for cultivation. Ibn 'Umar went, and I went with him, until he met him in Balat, and asked him about that, and he told him that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had forbidden leasing out land for cultivation. So 'Abdullah stopped lessening out land.
2454 | It was narrated that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us and said: 'Whoever has land, let him cultivate it or allow someone else to cultivate it, and not rent it out.' ”
2455 | It was narrated from Abu Sufyan, the freed slave of Ibn Abu Ahmad, that he told him that he heard Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri say:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade Muhaqlah.” (Sahih)Muhaqlah means leasing out land
2456 | It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that he heard that people were leasing out land more. He said:“Subhan-Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Why does not one of you lend it to his brother?' But he did not forbid leasing it out.' ”
2457 | It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“If one of you were to lend his brother his land, it would be better for him than taking such and such rent for it.”
2458 | It was narrated that Hazalah bin Qais said:“I asked Rafi' bin Khadij and he said: 'We used to lease out land on the basis that you would have what is produced by this piece of land, and I would have what is produced by this (other) piece of land, and we were forbidden to lease it out on the basis of crop-sharing but he did not forbid us to rent out land for silver.”
2459 | Rafi'bin Khadi'j narrated that his paternal uncle Zuhair said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade us from doing something that was convenient for us.” I said: “What the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said is true.” He said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “What do you with your farms?” We said: “We rent them out for one third or one quarter of their yield, and a certain amount of wheat and barley.” He said: “Do not do that; cultivate them or let others cultivate them.”
2460 | It was narrated  from Usaid bin Zuhair, the paternal nephew of Rafi' bin Khdij, that Rafi' bin Khadij said:“If one of us did not need his land, he would give it (to someone else to cultivate) in return for one third, or one half of the yield , and he would stipulate (that the should receive) the produce grows on the banks of three streams, and the grains that remain in the ear after threshing, and the produce irrigated by a stream. Life at that time was hard, and he would work (the land) with iron and whatever Allah (SWT) willed, and he would benefit from it. Then Rafi bin Khadij came to us and said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade you to do something that may seem beneficial to you, but obedience to Allah and obedience to His Messenger are more beneficial for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade Haq for you, and he said: “Whoever has no need of his land, let him give it to his brother (to cultivate) or let him leave it (uncultivated).”
2461 | Zaid bin Thabit said:“May Allah (SWT) forgive Rafi' bin Khadij. By Allah (SWT)! I have more knowledge of Ahadith than  he does. Two men who had quarreled came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: 'If this is your situation, do not lease farms,' and what Rafi' bin khadij heard was 'Do not lease farms.'  ”
2462 | It was narrated that 'Amr bin Dinar said:I said to Tawus: “O Abu 'Abdur-Rahman, why do you not give up this Mukhabarah because they claim that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade it.” He said: “O 'Amr, I help them by taking their land and cultivating it, and giving them something in return, and Mu`adh bin Jabal  allowed people here to do that. The most knowledgeable of them - meaning Ibn`Abbas - told me that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not forbid it, rather he said: 'For one you to give (land) to his brother is better than if he were to take a set amount in rent for it.'”
2463 | It was narrated from Tawus that :Mu`adh bin Jabl leased some land during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmah, in return for one third or one fourth (of the yield), and he was still doing that until this day of yours.
2464 | It was narrated from Tawus that Ibn`Abbas told that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) merely said:“For one of you to give (land) to his brother is better for him than if he were to take a set amount in rent for it.”
2465 | It was narrated that Rafi` bin khadij said:We used to give land in return for food at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and some of my paternal uncles came to them and said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever has land, he should not rent it out for a set amount of food.”
2466 | It was narrated that Rafi` bin Khadij said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever cultivates people`s land without their permission, he has no right to any produce, but he should be recompensed for his expenditure.' ”
2467 | It was narrated from Ibn `Umar that :the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered into a contract with the people of Khaibar for one half of the fruits or crops yielded.

He said: 'What are these people doing?' They said: 'They are taking something from the male part (of the plant) and putting it in the female part.' He said: 'I do not think that this will do any good.' News of that reached them, so they stopped doing it, and their yield declined. News of that reached the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: 'That was only my thought. If it will do any good, then do it. I am only a human being like you, and what I think may be right or wrong. But When I tell you: “Allah (SWT) says,” I will never tell lies about Allah (SWT).' ”
2471 | It was narrated from 'Aisha that the Prophet (ﷺ) heard some sounds and said:“What is this noise?” They said: “Palm trees that are being pollinated.” He said: “If they did not do that it would be better.” So they did not pollinate them that year, and the dates did not mature properly. they mentioned  that to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: “If it is one of the matters of your religion, then refer to me.”

And whoever gives salt, it is as if he has given in charity all that the salt makes good. And whoever gives a Muslim water to drink when water is available, it is as if he freed a slave; and whoever gives a Muslim water to drink when there is no water available, it is as if he brought him back to life.”
2475 | It was narrated from Abyad bin Hammal:That he asked for a salt flat called the Ma'rib Dam to be given to him, and it was  given to him. Then Aqra bin Habis At-Tamimi came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: “O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I used to come to the salt flat during the Ignorance period and it was in a land in which there was no water, and whoever came to it took from it. It was (plentiful) like flowing water.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked Abyad bin Hammal to give back his share of the salt flat. He said: “I give it to you on the basis that you make it charity given by me.” The Messenger of Allah said:  “It is a charity from you, and it is like flowing water, whoever comes to it may take from it.”(One of the narrators) Faraj said: “That is how it is today, whoever comes to it takes from it.” He said: “The Prophet (ﷺ) gave him land and palm trees in Jurf Murad instead, when he took back the salt flat from him.”

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Irrigate (your trees) O Zubair, then let the water flow to your neighbor.” The Ansari became angry and said: “O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), is it because he is your cousin (son of your paternal aunt)?” The expression of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) changed, then he said: “O Zubair, irrigate (your trees) then retain the water until it reaches the walls.” Zubair said: “I think this Verse was revealed concerning that: “But no, by your Lord, they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission [1].'” (Sahih)  [1] An-Nisa 4.

Those who came before you were only destroyed because when one of their nobles stole, they let him off, but when one of the weak people among them stole, they would carry out the punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand.”  (Sahih)(One of the narrators) Muhammad bin Rumh said: “I heard Laith bin Sa'd say: 'Allah(SWT) protected her (Fatimah) from stealing, and every Muslim should say this.'”

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Purification is better for her.” When we heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) speak so kindly, we went to Usamah and said: 'Speak to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) .' When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that, he stood up to speak and said: 'How much do you intercede with me concerning one of the legal punishments of Allah (SWT) that has befallen one of the female slaves of Allah (SWT)!

He said: 'My son was a servant of this man, and he committed adultery with his wife, and I ransomed him for one hundred sheep and a servant. I asked some men of knowledge and I was told that my son should be given one hundred lashes and exiled for a year, and that the wife of this man should be stoned.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I will judge between you according to the Book of Allah (SWT).

Rather stoning is a must if a man is married (or previously married) and proof is established, or if pregnancy results or if he admits it. I have read it (in the Quran). “And if an old man and an old woman commit adultery, stone them both.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stoned (adulterers) and we stoned (them) after him.' ”

Then he called one of their scholars and said: 'I adjure you by Allah (SWT) Who sent down the Tawrah (Torah) to Musa! Is this the punishment for the adulterer that you find in your Book?' He said: 'No; if you had not adjured me by Allah (SWT), I would not have told you. The punishment for the adulterer that we find in our Book is stoning, but many of our nobles were being stoned (because of the prevalence of adultery among them), so if we caught one of our nobles (committing adultery), we would let him go; but if we caught one of the weak among us, we would carry out the punishment on him. We said: “Come, let us agree upon something that we may impose on both noble and weak alike.” So we agreed to blacken the face and whip them, instead of stoning.' The Prophet (ﷺ) 'O Allah (SWT), I am the first of those who revive your command which they had killed off,' and he issued orders that (the man) be stoned.”

Allah (SWT) has granted you a good, lawful provision, but you have chosen the provision that Allah (SWT) has forbidden to you instead of that which He has permitted. If I had warned you before, I would have done such and such to you. Get away from me and repent to Allah (SWT). If you do that again, after this warning, I will give you a painful beating and shave your head, to make an example of you, and I will banish you from among your people, and tell the young men of Al-Madinah to come and take your goods,'Amr stood up, suffering grief and humiliation that is known only to Allah (SWT).

2622 | It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed Al Khudri said:“Shall I not tell you what I heard directly from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? I heard it and memorized it: 'A man killed ninety-nine people, then the idea of repentance occurred to him.

Can I repent?” He said: “After ninety-nine people?!” He said: 'So he drew his sword and killed him, thus completing one hundred. Then the idea of repentance occurred to him (again), so he asked who was the most knowledgeable of people, and he was told of a man (so he went to him) and said: “I have killed one hundred people. Can I repent?” He said: “Woe to you, what is stopping you from repenting? Leave the evil town where you are living and go to a good town, such and such town and worship your Lord there.” So he went out, heading for the good town, but death came to him on the road. The angels of mercy and angels of punishment argued over him. Iblis (Satan) said: “I have more right to him, for he never disobeyed me for a moment.” But the angels of mercy said: “He went out repenting.” (One of the narrators) Hammam said: “Humaid At-Tawil narrated to me from Bakr bin Abdullah that Abu Rafi said: 'So Allah (SWT) sent an angel to whom they referred (the case). He said: “Look and see which of the two towns was he closer, and put him with its people.” (One of the narrators) Qatadah said: “Hasan narrated to us: 'When death came to him he strove and drew closer to the good town, and farther away from the evil town, so they put him with the people of the good town.”
2623 | It was narrated from Abu Sharaih Al-Khuzai that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever suffers from killing or wounding, has the choice of three things, and if he wants the fourth then restrain him.

Uyainah bin Hisn came to him demanding vengeance for 'Amir bin Adbat who was from the tribe of Ashja. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to them: “Will you accept the blood money?'” But they refused. Then a man from Banu Laith, whose name was Mukaital, stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)! By Allah (SWT)! This man who was killed in the early days of Islam is like Sheep that come to drink but stones are thrown at them, so the last of them runs away (i.e. ,the murderer should be killed).' The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'You will have fifty (camels) while we are traveling and fifty (camels) when we return.' So they accepted the blood money.”
2626 | It was narrated from 'Amr bin Shu'aib, from this father, from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever kills deliberately, he will be handed over to the heirs of the victim. If they want, they may kill him, or if they want, they may accept the blood money, which is thirty Hiqqah, thirty Jadha'ah and forty Khalifah. This is the blood money for deliberate slaying.

The one who is killed by mistake is the one who is killed with a whip or a stick; for him the blood money is one hundred camels, of which forty should be pregnant she-camels with their youngs in their wombs.

Do you agree?” They said: “No.” The Emigrants wanted to attack them, but the Prophet (ﷺ) told them not to, so they refrained. Then he called them and offered them more and said: “Do you agree?” They said: “Yes.” He said: “I am going to address the people and tell them that you agreed.” They said: “Yes.” So the Prophet (ﷺ) addressed (the people) then said: “Do you Agree?” They said: “Yes.”
2639 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ruled concerning a fetus that (the blood money) was a slave, male and female.

You recite: '(The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts.' The sons of one mother (from the same father) inherit from one another, but not the sons from different mothers (but the same father).”
2716 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that a man asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ):“My father died and left behind wealth, but he did not make a will. Will it expiate for him if I give charity on his behalf?” He said: “Yes.”
2717 | It was narrated from Aishah that a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said:“My mother died unexpectedly and she had not made a will. I think that if she could have spoken, she would have given in charity. Will she have a reward if I give in charity on her behalf, and will I have a reward?” He said: “Yes.”
2718 | It was narrated from 'Amr bin Shu'aib from his father, that his a grandfather said:“A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: 'I do not have anything and I have no wealth, but I have an orphan (under my care) who has wealth.” He said: “Eat from the wealth of your orphan, without being extravagant or use it for trade.” He (narrator) said: “And I think he said: 'Do not preserve your wealth using his instead.'”
2719 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“O Abu Hurairah. Learn about the inheritance and teach it, for it is half of knowledge, but it will be forgotten. This is the first thing that will be taken away from my nation.’”
2720 | It was narrated that Jabir bin ‘Abdullah said:“The wife of Sa’d bin Rabi’ came with the two daughters of Sa’d to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, these are the two daughters of Sa’d. He was killed with you on the day of Uhud, and their paternal uncle has taken all that their father left behind, and a woman is only married for her wealth.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent until the Verse of inheritance was revealed to him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the brother of Sa’d bin Rabi’ and said: ‘Give the two daughters of Sa’d two thirds of his wealth, and give his wife on eighth, and take what is left.’”
2721 | It was narrated that Huzail bin Shurahbil said:“A man came to Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari and Salman bin Rabi’ah Al-Bahili and asked them about (the shares of) a daughter, a son’s daughter, a sister through one’s father and mother. They said: ‘The daughter gets one half, and what is left goes to the sister. Go to Ibn Mas’ud, for he will concur with what we say.’ So the man went to Ibn Mas’ud, and told him what they had said. ‘Abdullah said: ‘I will go astray and will not be guided (if I say that I agree); but I will judge as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) judged. The daughter gets one half, and the son’s daughter gets one- sixth. That makes two thirds. And what is left goes to the sister.’”
2722 | It was narrated that Ma’qil bin Yasar Al-Muzani said:“I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) when a case was brought to him which involved the share of a grandfather. He gave him one third, or one sixth.”
2723 | It was narrated that Ma’qil bin Yasar said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ruled concerning a grandfather who was among us, that he should receive one sixth.”
2724 | It was narrated that Ibn Dhu’aib said:“A grandmother came to Abu Bakr Siddiq and asked him for her inheritance. Abu Bakr said to her: ‘You have nothing according to the Book of Allah, and I don’t know of anything for you according to the Book of Allah, and I don’t know of anything for you according to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Go back until I ask the people.’ So he asked the people and Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah said: ‘I was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he gave her (the grandmother) one sixth.’ Abu Bakr said: ‘Is there anyone else with you (who will corroborate what you say)?’ Muhammad bin Maslamah Al-Ansari stood up and said something like what Mughirah bin Shu’bah had said. So Abu Bakr applied it in her case.”
2725 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave a grandmother one sixth of the inheritance.
2726 | It was narrated from Ma’dan bin Abu Talhah Al-Ya’muri that ‘Umar bin Khattab stood up to deliver a sermon one Friday, or he addressed them one Friday. He praised and glorified Allah, and said:“By Allah, I am not leaving behind any problem more difficult than the one who leaves behind an heir. I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he never spoke so harshly to me about anything as he spoke to me about this. He jabbed his finger into my side or my chest and said: ‘O ‘Umar, sufficient for you is the Verse that was revealed in summer, at the end of Surat An-Nisa’.”
2727 | ‘Umar bin Khattab said:“There are three things, if the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had clarified them, that would have been dearer to me than the world and everything in it: a person who leaves behind no heir, usury, and the caliphate.”
2728 | It was narrated from Muhammad bin Munkadir that he heard Jabir bin ‘Abdullah say:“I fell sick and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to visit me, he and Abu Bakr with him, and they came walking. I had lost consciousness, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed ablution and poured some of the water of his ablution over me. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what should I do? How should I decide about my wealth?’ Until the Verse of inheritance was revealed at the end of An-Nisa’: “If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants or descendents.” [4:12] And: “They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: ‘Allah directs (thus) about those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs.’” [4:176]
2729 | It was narrated from Usamah bin Zaid, who attributed it to the Prophet (ﷺ):“The Muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever and the disbeliever does not inherit from a Muslim.”
2730 | It was narrated from Usamah bin Zaid that he said:“O Messenger of Allah, will you stay in your house in Makkah?” He said: “Has ‘Aqeel left us any houses?”  'Aqeel had inherited Abu Talib along with Talib. Neither Ja'far nor 'Ali inherited anything because they had been Muslims, and 'Aqeel and Talib had been disbelievers. So on account of that, Omar would say the believer does not inherit from the disbeliever. And Usamah said: the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said "The Muslim does not inherit from the disbeliever nor the disbeliever from the Muslim."
2731 | It was narrated from ‘Amr bin Shu’aib, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“People of two different religions do not inherit from one another.”
2732 | It was narrated from ‘Amr bin Shu’aib, from his father, that his grandfather said:“Rabab bin Hudhaifah (bin Sa’eed) bin Sahm married Umm Wa’il bint Ma’mar Al-Jumahiyyah, and she bore him three sons. Their mother died and her sons inherited her houses and the Wala’ of her freed slaves. ‘Amr bin ‘As took them out to Sham, and they died of the plague of ‘Amwas. ‘Amr inherited from them, and he was their ‘Asabah.* When ‘Amr came back, Banu Ma’mar came to him and they referred their dispute with him concerning the Wala’ of their sister to ‘Umar. ‘Umar said: ‘I will judge between you according to what I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I heard him say: “What the son or father acquires goes to his. ‘Asabah, no matter who they are.’” So he ruled in our favour and wrote a document to that effect, in which was the testimony of ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf, Zaid bin Thabit and someone else. Then when ‘Abdul-Malik bin Marwan was appointed caliph, a freed slave of hers (Umm Wa’il’s) died, leaving behind two thousand Dinar. I heard that that ruling had been changed, so they referred the dispute to Hisham bin Isma’il. We referred the matter to ‘Abdul-Malik, and brought him the document of ‘Umar. He said: ‘I thought that this was a ruling concerning which there was no doubt. I never thought that the people of Al-Madinah would reach such a state that they would doubt this ruling. So he ruled in our favour, and it remained like that afterwards.”
2733 | It was narrated from ‘Aishah that the freed slave of the Prophet (ﷺ) fell from a palm tree and died. He left behind wealth but he had no child or close relative. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Give his legacy to a man from his village.”
2734 | It was narrated that the daughter of Hamzah said:“My freed slave died, leaving behind a daughter. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) divided his wealth between myself and his daughter, giving me half and her half.”
2735 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The killer does not inherit.”
2736 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up, on the day of the conquest of Makkah, and said:“A woman inherits from the blood money and wealth of her husband, and he inherits from her blood money and wealth, so long as one of them did not kill the other. If one of them killed the other deliberately, then he or she inherits nothing from the blood money or wealth. If one of them killed the other by mistake, he or she inherits from the other’s wealth, but not from the blood money.”
2737 | It was narrated from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunaif that a man shot an arrow at another man and killed him, and he had no heir except a maternal uncle. Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Jarrah wrote to ‘Umar about that, and ‘Umar wrote back to him saying that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Allah and His Messenger are the guardians of the one who has no guardian, and the maternal uncle is the heir of one who has no other heir.”
2738 | It was narrated from Miqdam Abu Karimah, a man from Sham who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever leaves behind wealth, it is for his heirs. Whoever leaves behind poor dependents and a debt, it is for us to take care of – or he said: ‘It is for Allah and His Messenger (to take care of) – I am the heir of the one who has no heir, I will pay the blood money on his behalf and inherit from him. And the maternal uncle is the heir of the one who has no heir, he pays blood money on his behalf and inherits from him.”
2739 | It was narrated that ‘Ali bin Abu Talib said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ruled that the sons from the same mother inherit from one another, but not sons from different mothers. A man inherits from his full brother from the same father and mother, but not his brothers from his father.”
2740 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Distribute wealth among those who are entitled to shares of inheritance, according to the Book of Allah, then whatever is left over goes to the nearest male relative.’”
2741 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“A man died at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he left no heir except for a slave whom he had set free. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave the legacy to him.”
2742 | It was narrated from Wathilah bin Asqa’ that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“A woman may get three types of inheritance: From her freed slave woman, a foundling whom she raised, and her child concerning whom she swore in Li’an that he was legitimate.”
2743 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“Then the Verse of Li’an was revealed, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Any woman who attributed her child to people to whom he does not belong, then she has no relation to (the religion of) Allah, and she will never enter Paradise, and any man who rejects his child, while he recognizes him, Allah will screen Himself from him on the Day of Resurrection and disgrace him before the witnesses.’”
2744 | It was narrated from ‘Amr bin Shu’aib, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“It is disbelief for a man to attribute himself to someone other than his father knowingly, or to deny his connection to his father, even subtly.”*
2745 | It was narrated from ‘Amr bin Shu’aib, from his father, from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever commits adultery with a slave woman or a free woman, his child is illegitimate, and he cannot inherit from him or be inherited from (i.e., this child cannot inherit from him).”
2746 | It was narrated from ‘Amr bin Shu’aib, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Every child who is attributed to his father after his father to whom he is attributed has died, and his heirs attributed him to him after he died, he ruled that* whoever was born to a slave woman whom he owned at the time when he had intercourse with her, he should be named after the one to whom he was attributed, but he has no share of any inheritance that was distributed previously. Whatever inheritance he finds has not yet been distributed, he will have a share of it. But he cannot be named after his father if the man whom he claimed as his father did not acknowledge him. If he as born to a slave woman whom his father did not own, or to a free woman with whom he committed adultery, then he cannot be named after him and he does not inherit from him, even if the one whom he claims as his father acknowledges him. So he is an illegitimate child who belongs to his mother’s people, whoever they are, whether she is a free woman or a slave.”
2747 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade selling the right of inheritance or giving it away.”
2748 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade selling the right of inheritance, or giving it as a gift.
2749 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whatever division of inheritance was made during the Ignorance period, stands according to the division of the Ignorance period, and whatever division of inheritance was made during Islam, it stands according to the division of Islam.”
2750 | It was narrated from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“If the child has cired, the (funeral) prayer should be offered for him (if he dies) and he is an heir.”
2751 | It was narrated from Jabir bin ‘Abdullah and Miswar bin Makhrumah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“No child inherits until he raises his voice or cries.”
2752 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Mawhab said:“I heard Tamim Ad- Dari say: ‘I said: O Messenger of Allah, what is the Sunnah concerning a man from among the People of the Book who becomes a Muslim at the hands of another man?’ He said: ‘He is the closest of all people to him in life and in death.’”
2753 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Allah has prepared (reward) for those who go out (to fight) in His cause: ‘And do not go out except (to fight) for Jihad in My cause, out of faith in Me and belief in My Messengers, but he has a guarantee from Me that I will admit him to Paradise, or I will return him to his dwelling from which he set out, with the reward that he attained, or the spoils that he acquired.’ Then he said: ‘By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, were it not that it would be too difficult for the Muslims, I would never have stayed behind from any expedition that went out in the cause of Allah. But I could not find the resources to give them mounts and they could not find the resources to follow me, nor would they be pleased to stay behind if I went. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, I wish I could fight in the cause of Allah and be killed, then fight and be killed, then fight and be killed.’”
2754 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The one who fights in the cause of Allah has a guarantee from Allah. Either He will raise him to His forgiveness and mercy, or He will send him back with reward and spoils of war. The likeness of the one who fights in the cause of Allah is that of one who fasts and prays at night without ceasing, until he returns.”
2755 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Going out in the morning in the cause of Allah, or in the evening, is more virtuous than the world and what is in it.”
2756 | It was narrated from Sahl bin Sa’d As-Sa’idi that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Going out in the morning in the cause of Allah, or in the evening, is better than the world and what is in it.”
2757 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Going out in the morning in the cause of Allah, or in the evening, is better than the world and what is in it.”
2758 | It was narrated that ‘Umar bin Khattab said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Whoever equips a warrior in the cause of Allah until he is fully equipped, he will have a reward like his, until he dies or returns.”
2759 | It was narrated from Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever equips a warrior in the cause of Allah, he will have a reward like his, without that detracting from the warrior’s reward in the slightest.”
2760 | It was narrated from Thawban that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The best Dinar that a man can spend is a Dinar that he spends on his family, a Dinar that he spends on a horse in the cause of Allah, and a Dinar that a man spends on his companions in the cause of Allah.”
2761 | It was narrated from ‘Ali bin Abu Talib, Abu Darda’, Abu Hurairah, Abu Umamah Al-Bahili, ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar, ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr, Jabir bin ‘Abdullah and ‘Imran bin Husain, all of them narrating that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever sends financial support in the cause of Allah and stays at home, for every Dirham he will have (the reward of) seven hundred Dirham. Whoever fights himself in the cause of Allah, and spends on that, for every Dirham he will have (the reward of) seven hundred thousand Dirham.” Then he recited the Verse: “Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills.”[2:261]
2762 | It was narrated from Abu Umamah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Whoever does not fight, or equip a fighter, or stay behind to look after a fighter’s family, Allah will strike him with a calamity before the Day of Resurrection.”
2763 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever meets Allah with no mark on him (as a result of fighting) in His cause, he will meet Him with a deficiency.”
2764 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:“When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was returning from the campaign of Tabuk, and had drawn close to Al-Madinah, he said: ‘In Al-Madinah there are people who, as you traveled and crossed valleys, were with you.’ They said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, even though they are in Al-Madinah?’ He said: ‘Even though they were in Al-Madinah. They were kept behind by (legitimate) excuses.’”
2765 | It was narrated from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“in Al-Madinah there are men who, every time you crossed a valley or travelled a road, they shared with you in the reward. They were kept behind by (legitimate) excuses.”
2766 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Zubair said:“Uthman bin ‘Affan addressed the people and said: ‘O people! I heard a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and nothing kept me from narrating it to you except for the fact that I did not want to lose you and your companionship. So it is up to you. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: “Whoever spends a night guarding the frontier in the cause of Allah, it will be like a thousand nights spent in fasting and prayer.”
2767 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever dies being prepared in the cause of Allah, will be given continuously the reward for the good deeds that he used to do, and he will be rewarded with provision, and he will be kept safe from Fattan,* and Allah will raise him on the Day of Resurrection free of fright.”
2768 | It was narrated that Ubayy bin Ka’b said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘For guarding the frontier for a day in the cause of Allah, defending the Muslims, seeking reward, apart from in the month of Ramadan, there is a reward granted greater than worshipping for a hundred years, fasting and praying. Guarding the frontier for a day in the cause of Allah, defending the Muslims, seeking reward, in the month of Ramadan, is better before Allah and brings a greater reward” – I think he said – “than worshipping for a thousand years, fasting and praying. If Allah returns him to his family safe and sound, no bad deed will be recorded for him for a thousand years, but his good deeds will be recorded, and the reward for guarding the frontier will come to him until the Day of Resurrection.”
2769 | It was narrated from ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir Al-Juhani that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“May Allah have mercy on the one who keeps watch over the troops.”
2770 | It was narrated that Sa’eed bin Khalid bin Abu Tuwail said:I heard Anas bin Malik saying: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “Standing guard one night in the cause of Allah is better than a man fasting and praying, among his family, for a thousand years. The year is three hundred and sixty days and a day is like a thousand years.”
2771 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to a man:“I advise you to fear Allah and to say the Takbir (Allahu Akbar) in every high place.”
2772 | It was narrated from Hammad bin Zaid from Thabit, that the Prophet (ﷺ) was mentioned before Anas bin Malik and he said:“He was the best of people, the most generous of people, the most courageous of people. The people of Al-Madinah became alarmed one night, and he was the first of them to investigate the noise and din. He was riding a horse belonging to Abu Talhah, bareback, with no saddle. His sword was hanging from his neck and he was saying: ‘O people, do not be afraid,’ sending them back to their houses. Then he said of the horse, ‘We found it like a sea,’ or, ‘It is a sea.’”*
2773 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“If you are called to arms then go forth.”
2774 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The dust (of Jihad) in the cause of Allah and the smoke of Hell will never be combined in the interior of a Muslim.”
2775 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever goes out in the cause of Allah will have the equivalent of the dust that got on him, in musk, on the Day of Resurrection.”
2776 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that his maternal aunt Umm Harim bint Milhan said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) slept near me one day, then he woke up smiling. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what has made you smile?’ He said: ‘People of my nation who were shown to me (in my dream) riding across this sea like kings on thrones.’ I said: ‘Supplicate to Allah to make me one of them.’” So he prayed for her. Then he slept again, and did likewise, and she said the same as she said before, and he replied in the same manner. She said: “Pray to Allah to make me one of them,” and he said: “You will be one of the first ones.” He said: “Then she went out with her husband, ‘Ubadah bin Samit, as a fighter, the first time that the Muslims crossed the sea with Mu’awiyah bin Abu Sufyan. On their way back, after they had finished fighting, they stopped in Sham. An animal was brought near for her to ride it, but it threw her off, and she died.”
2777 | It was narrated from Abu Darda’ that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“A military expedition by sea is like ten expeditions by land. The one who suffers from seasickness is like one who gets drenched in his own blood in the cause of Allah.”
2778 | It was narrated that Sulaim bin ‘Amr said:I heard Abu Umamah saying: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “The martyr at sea is like two martyrs on land, and the one who suffers seasickness is like one who gets drenched in his own blood on land. The time spent between one wave and the next is like a lifetime spent in obedience to Allah. Allah has appointed the Angel of Death to seize souls, except for the martyr at sea, for Allah Himself seizes their souls. He forgives the martyrs on land for all sins except debt, but (He forgives) the martyr at sea all his sins and his debt.”
2779 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Even if there was only one day left of this world, Allah would make it last until a man from my household took possession of (the mountain of) Dailam and Constantinople.”
2780 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The horizons will be opened to you, and you will conquer a city called Qazvin. Whoever is stationed there for forty days or forty nights, will have pillars of gold in Paradise, with green chrysolite and topped by a dome of rubies. It will have seventy thousand doors, at each door will be a wife from among the wide-eyed houris.’”
2781 | It was narrated that Mu’awiyah bin Jahimah As-Sulaimi said:“I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I want to go for Jihad with you, seeking thereby the Face of Allah and the Hereafter.’ He said: ‘Woe to you! Is your mother still alive?’ I said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Go back and honor her.’ Then I approached him from the other side and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I want to go for Jihad with you, seeking thereby the Face of Allah and the Hereafter.’ He said: ‘Woe to you! Is your mother still alive?’ I said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Go back and honour her.’ Then I approached him from in front and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I want to go for Jihad with you, seeking thereby the Face of Allah and the Hereafter.’ He said: ‘Woe to you! Is your mother still alive?’ I said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Go back and serve her, for there is Paradise.’”  Another chain reports a similar hadith.  Ibn Majah said: This is Jahimah bin 'Abbas bin Mirdas As-Sulaimi who  criticized the Prophet ﷺ the Day of Hunain.
2782 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr said:“A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have come seeking to go out in Jihad with you, seeking thereby the Face of Allah and the Hereafter. I have come even though my parents are weeping.’ He said: ‘Go back to them and make them smile as you have made them weep.’”
2783 | It was narrated that Abu Musa said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about a man who fights to prove his courage, or out of pride and honour for his close relatives, or to show off. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever fights so that the Word of Allah may be supreme is the one who (is fighting) in the cause of Allah.’”
2784 | It was narrated that Abu ‘Uqbah, who was the freed slave of some Persian people, said:“I was present with the Prophet (ﷺ) on the Day of Uhud. I struck a man from among the idolaters and said: ‘Take that! And I am a Persian slave!’ News of that reached the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: ‘Why did you not say: “Take that! And I am an Ansari slave!?”
2785 | ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr said:“I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: ‘There is no band of warriors that fights in the cause of Allah and acquires war spoils, but they have been given two thirds of their reward, but if they do not get any spoils of war, then they will have their reward in full (in the Hereafter).’”
2786 | It was narrated from ‘Urwah Al-Bariqi that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Goodness is tied to the forelocks of horses until the Day of Resurrection.”
2787 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There is goodness in the forelocks of horses until the Day of Resurrection.”
2788 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There is goodness in the forelocks of horses” – or he said: “There is goodness tied in the forelocks of horses.” Suhail (one of the narrators) said: “I am not certain of” – “until the Day of Resurrection. And horses are of three types: those that bring reward to a man, those that are a means of protection for a man, and those that are a burden (of sin) for a man. As for those that bring reward, a man keeps them in the cause of Allah and keeps them constantly ready (for Jihad), so they do not take any fodder into their stomachs but a reward will be written for him, and if he puts them out to pasture, they do not eat anything but reward will be written for him. If he gives them to drink from a flowing river, for every drop that enters their stomachs there will be reward,” (continuing) until he mentioned reward in conjunction with their urine and droppings, and even when they run here and there by themselves, for each step they take a reward will be written for him – ‘As for those that are a means of protection, a man keeps them because they are a source of dignity and adornment, but he does not forget the rights of their backs and stomachs (i.e., their right not to be overworked and their right to be fed) whether at times of their difficulty or ease. As for those that bring a burden (of sin), the one who keeps them for purposes of wrongdoing or for pomp and show before people, is the one for whom they bring a burden of sin.”
2789 | It was narrated from Abu Qatadah Al-Ansari that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The best of horses are those that are deep black, with a blaze on the forehead, white marks on the legs and white nose and upper lip, and with no whiteness on the right foreleg. If not deep-black, then reddish-brown, with these markings.”
2790 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) used to dislike horses that had three legs with white markings on them, and one leg the same color as the rest of the body.”
2791 | It was narrated that Tamim Ad-Dari said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Whoever ties a horse in the cause of Allah, then feeds it with his own hand, he will have one merit for every grain.’”
2792 | Mu’adh bin Jabal narrated that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say:“Any Muslim who fights in the cause of Allah for the time between two milkings of a she-camel, he will be guaranteed Paradise.”
2793 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:“I was present in a war, and ‘Abdullah bin Rawahah said: O soul of mine! I see that you do Not want to go to Paradise. I swear by Allah that you surely Will enter it, willingly or Unwillingly.’”
2794 | It was narrated that ‘Amr bin ‘Abasah said:“I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, which Jihad is best?’ He said: ‘(That of a man) whose blood is shed and his horse is wounded.’”
2795 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There is no one who is wounded in the cause of Allah – and Allah knows best of who is wounded in His cause – but he will come on the Day of Resurrection with his wounds looking as they did on the day he was wounded; their color will be the color of blood but their smell will be the fragrance of musk.”

O Allah, destroy them and shake them.’”

2798 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah:“Mention of the martyrs was made in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: ‘The earth does not dry of the blood of the martyr until his two wives rush to him like two wet nurses who lost their young ones in a stretch of barren land, and in the hand of each one of them will be a Hullah* that is better than this world and everything in it.’”
2799 | It was narrated from Miqdam bin Ma’dikarib that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The martyr has six things (in store) with Allah: He is forgiven from the first drop of his blood that is shed; he is shown his place in Paradise; he is spared the torment of the grave; he is kept safe from the Great Fright; he is adorned with a garment of faith; he is married to (wives) from among the wide-eyed houris; and he is permitted to intercede for seventy of his relatives.”
2800 | It was narrated from Jabir bin ‘Abdullah:“When ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin Haram was killed, on the Day of Uhud, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘O Jabir, shall I not tell you what Allah said to your father?’ I said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Allah does not speak to anyone except from behind a screen, but He spoke to your father face to face and said: “O My slave, ask Me and I shall give you.” He said: “O my Lord, bring me back to life so that I may be killed for Your sake a second time.” He said: “I have already decreed that they will not return (to the world after death).” He said: “O Lord, convey (the good news about my state) to those whom I have left behind.” So Allah revealed this Verse: ‘Think not of those as dead who are killed in the way of Allah.’”[3:169]
2801 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah concerning the Verse:“Think not of those as dead who are killed in the way of Allah. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision,”[3:169] that he said: “We asked about that, and (the Prophet (ﷺ)) said: ‘Their souls are like green birds that fly wherever they wish in Paradise, then they come back to lamps suspended from the Throne. While they were like that, your Lord looked at them and said, “Ask me for whatever you want.” They said: “O Lord, what should we ask You for when we can fly wherever we wish in Paradise?” When they saw that they would not be left alone until they had asked for something, they said: “We ask You to return our souls to our bodies in the world so that we may fight for Your sake (again).” When He saw that they would not ask for anything but that, they were left alone.’”
2802 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The martyr does not feel anything more when he is killed than one of you feels if he is pinched (by a bug).”

One of his family members said:“We hoped that when he died it would be as a martyr in the cause of Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “In that case the martyrs of my nation would be few. Being killed in the cause of Allah is martyrdom; dying of the plague is martyrdom; when a pregnant woman dies in childbirth that is martyrdom; and dying of drowning, or burning, or of pleurisy, is martyrdom.”
2804 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“What do you say among yourselves about the martyr?” They said: “The one who is killed in the cause of Allah.” He said: “In that case the martyrs among my nation would be few. Whoever is killed in the cause of Allah is a martyr; whoever dies in the cause of Allah is a martyr; whoever dies of a stomach disease is a martyr; and whoever dies of the plague is a martyr.”  Another chain narrates with the addition of "and the drowned is a martyr."

2810 | It was narrated that ‘Ali said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had an Arabian bow in his hand, and he saw a man who had a Persian bow in his hand. He said: ‘What is this? Throw it away. You should use this and others like it, and Qana* spears. Perhaps Allah will support His religion thereby and enable you to conquer lands.’”
2811 | It was narrated from ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir Al-Juhani that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Allah will admit three people to Paradise by virtue of one arrow: The one who makes it, seeking reward by making it well; the one who shoots it; and the one who hands it to him.” And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Shoot and ride, and if you shoot that is dearer to me than if you ride. All things that a Muslim man does for entertainment are in vain except for shooting arrows, training his horse and playing with his wife, for these are things that bring reward.”

2858 | It was narrated from Ibn Buraidah that his father said:“Whenever he appointed a man to lead a military detachment, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would advise him especially to fear Allah and treat the Muslims with him well. He (ﷺ) said: ‘Fight in the Name of Allah and in the cause of Allah. Fight those how disbelieve in Allah. Fight but do not be treacherous, do not steal from the spoils of war, do not mutilate and do not kill children. When you meet your enemy from among the polytheists, call them to one of three things. Whichever of them they respond to, accept it from them and refrain from fighting them. Invite them to accept Islam, and if they respond then accept it from them and refrain from fighting them. Then invite them to leave their land and move to the land of the polytheists. Tell them that if they do that, then they will have the same rights and duties as the polytheists. If they refuse, then tell them that they will be like the Muslim Bedouins (who live in the desert), subject to the same rulings of Allah as the believers. But they will have no share of Fay’* or war spoils, unless they fight alongside the Muslims. If they refuse to enter Islam, then ask them to pay the Poll-tax. If they do that, then accept it from them and refrain from fighting them. But if they refuse, then seek the help of Allah against them and fight them. If you lay siege to them and they want you to give them the protection of Allah and your Prophet, do not give them the protection of Allah and your Prophet, rather give them your protection and the protection of your father and your Companions, for if you violate your protection and the protection of your fathers, that is easier than violating the protection of Allah and the protection of His Messenger. If you lay siege to them and they want you to let them come out with a promise of the judgement of Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ), do not offer them a promise of the judgement of Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ), rather offer them your judgement, because you do not know if you will actually pass (the same as) Allah’s judgement regarding them or not.’”  Another chain reports a similar hadith.

2863 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent ‘Alqamah bin Mujazziz at the head of a detachment, and I was among them.

When we were partway there, the people lit a fire to warm themselves and cook some food. ‘Abdullah, who was a man who liked to joke, said:“Do I not have the right that you should listen to me and obey?” They said: “Yes.” He said: “And if I command you to do something, will you not do it?” They said: “Of course.” He said: “Then I command you to jump into this fire.” Some people got up and got ready to jump, and when he saw that they were about to jump, he said: “Restrain yourselves, for I was joking with you.” When we came to Al-Madinah, they mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever among you commands you to do something that involves disobedience to Allah, do not obey him.”
2864 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The Muslim is obliged to obey (the ruler) whether he likes it or not, unless he is commanded to commit an act of disobedience. If he is commanded to commit a sin then he should neither listen nor obey.”

There is no obedience to one who disobeys Allah.”

2867 | ‘Awf bin Malik Al-Ashja’i said:“We were with the Prophet (ﷺ) – seven or eight or nine of us – and he said: ‘Will you not give pledge to the Messenger of Allah?’ So we stretched forth our hands and someone said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, we have already given you our pledge. On what basis shall we give this pledge?’ He said: ‘(On the basis that) you will worship Allah and not associate anything with Him, you will establish the five daily prayers, you will listen and obey’ – then he spoke some words under his breath – ‘and you will not ask the people for anything.’ He said: ‘I saw some of that group. If he dropped his whip he would not ask anyone to pick it up for him.’”
2868 | It was narrated that ‘Attab, the freed slave of Hurmuz, said:“I heard Anas bin Malik say: ‘We gave our pledge to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the basis that we would listen and obey. He (ﷺ) said: “As much as you can.”

Then after that he did not accept the pledge from anyone until he had asked whether he was a slave.”
2870 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There are three to whom Allah will not speak on the Day of Resurrection, not will He look at them nor purify them, and theirs will be a painful torment: A man who has surplus water in the desert and withholds it from a wayfarer; a man who sells a man his product after ‘Asr, swearing by Allah that he bought it for such and such a price, and the other believes him, but that is not the case; and a man who gives his pledge to a ruler, only doing to for the purpose of worldly gain, and if he is given something he fulfills it, but if he is not given anything he does not fulfill it.”
2871 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The affairs of the Children of Israel were administered by their Prophets. Every time a Prophet left, he was followed by another, but there will be no Prophet among you after I am gone.” They said: “What will happen, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “There will be caliphs and there will be many of them.” They said: “What should we do?” He said: “Fulfill your pledge to the first one, then the one who comes after him, and do the duties required of you, for Allah will question them about the duties upon them.”
2872 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“A banner will be set up for every traitor on the Day of Resurrection, and it will be said: ‘This is the treachery of so-and- so.’”

2875 | ‘Aishah the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“When the believing women emigrated to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), they would be tested in accordance with Allah’s saying: ‘O Prophet! When believing women come to you to give you the pledge...’”[60:12]  ‘Aishah said: “Whoever among the believing women affirmed this, passed the test. When they affirmed that, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would say to them: ‘Go, for you have given your pledge.’ No, by Allah! The hand of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never touched the hand of any woman, rather he accepted their pledge in words only.” ‘Aishah said: “By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not demand of women (in their pledge) anything other than that which Allah had commanded, and the hand of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never touched the hand of a woman. He would say to them, when he had accepted their pledge: ‘You have given your pledge,’ verbally.”
2876 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever enters a horse (in a race) between two other horses, not knowing whether it will win, that is not gambling.

They said:“You have distributed it to our brothers Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib, but we are related to you (to Banu Hashim) in the same way (as Banu Muttalib).” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Rather I think that Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib are the same.”*
2882 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Traveling is a kind of torment, it keeps anyone of you from his sleep, food and drink. When anyone of you has fulfilled the purpose for which he travled, let him hasten to return to his family.”  Another chain reports a similar hadith.

They asked: ‘Is it every year?’ He said: ‘No. If I had said yes, it would have become obligatory.’ Then the following was revealed: “O you who believe!

By his head there is an angel who says Amin to his supplication, and every time he prays for his brother, he says: “Amin, and the same for you.’” He said: “Then I went out to the marketplace where I met Abu Darda’, and he told me something similar from the Prophet (ﷺ).”

Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).” He said: “And Ibn ‘Umar used to add: Labbaika labbaika labbaika wa sa’daika wal-khairu fi yadaika, labbaika war-raghba’u ilaika wal-‘amal (Here I am, here I am, here I am, and at Your service; all good is in Your Hands, here I am, seeking Your pleasure and striving for Your sake).”

The slave looked and his camel was not with him, so he said to him: ‘Where is your camel?’ He said: ‘I lost it yesterday.’ He said: ‘You have one camel with you and you lost it?’ He started to beat him, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Look at what this Muhrim is doing!’”

Abdullah bin ‘Abbas said that the Muhrim may wash his head, and Miswar said that the Muhrim may not wash his head. Ibn ‘Abbas sent me to Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari to ask him about that, and I found him taking a bath near the well, screened with a piece of cloth. I greeted him with Salam, and he said:“Who is this?” I said: “I am ‘Abdullah bin Hunain. ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas sent me to you to ask you how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to wash his head when he was in Ihram.” He said: “Abu Ayyub put his hand on the cloth and lowered it until his head appeared, then he said to someone who was pouring water for him, Pour water. So he poured water on his head. Then he rubbed his head with his hands, forwards and backwards, and said: ‘This is what I saw him (ﷺ) doing.’”
2935 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“We were with the Prophet (ﷺ), and we were in Ihram. When a rider met us we would lower our garments from the top of our heads, and when he has gone, we would lift them up again.”  Another chain reports a similar hadith.

Had I not seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kissing you, I would not have kissed you.’”
2944 | It was narrated that Sa’eed bin Jubair said:I heard Ibn ‘Abbas say: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “This Stone will be brought on the Day of Resurrection, and it will be given two eyes with which to see, and a tongue with which to speak, and it will bear witness for those who touched it in sincerity.”
2945 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned to face the Stone, then he put his lips on it and wept for a long time. Then he turned and saw ‘Umar bin Khattab weeping. He said: ‘O ‘Umar, this is the place where tears should be shed.’”

Whoever says: Allahumma inni as’alukal-‘afwa wal-‘afiyah fid-dunya wal-akhirah; Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanah, wa fil-akhirati hasanah, wa qina ‘adhaban-Nar (O Allah, I ask You for pardon and well-being in this world and in the Hereafter. Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter and protect us from the torment of the Fire), they say: Amin.” When he reached the Black Corner (where the Black Stone is), he said: O Abu Muhammad! What have you heard about this Black Corner? ‘Ata’ said: Abu Hurairah told me that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “Whoever faces it is facing the Hand of the Most Merciful.’” Ibn Hisham said to him: O Abu Muhammad, what about Tawaf? ‘Ata’ said: Abu Hurairah told me that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: “Whoever performs Tawaf around the House seven times and does not say anything except: Subhan Allah wal-hamdu lillah, wa la ilaha illallah wa Allahu Akbar, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (Glory is to Allah, praise is to Allah, none has the right to be worshipping but Allah, and there is no power nor strength except with Allah), ten bad deeds will be erased from him, ten merits will be recorded for him, and he will be raised ten degrees in status. Whoever performs Tawaf and talks when he is in that situation, is wading in mercy like one who wades in water.”
2958 | It was narrated that Muttalib said:“When he finished seven (circuits of Tawaf), I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) come until he was parallel with the Corner, then he prayed two Rak’ah at the edge of the Mataf (area for Tawaf), and there was nothing between him and the people who were performing Tawaf.”

Have your menses come?’ I said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘This is something that Allah has decreed for the daughters of Adam.

Salman bin Rabi’ah and Zaid bin Suhan heard me when I was entering Ihram for them both together at Qadisiyyah. They said: ‘This man is more lost than his camel!’ It was as if they had heaped a mountain on me with their words. I went to ‘Umar bin Khattab and told him about that.

Know that Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) had a group from his family perform ‘Umrah during the ten (days) of Dhul-Hijjah, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not forbid that, and no abrogation of that was revealed, and it does not matter what anyone else suggests.’”
2979 | It was narrated from Ibrahim bin Abu Musa:“Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari used to issue rulings concerning Tamattu’. Then a man said to him: ‘Withhold some of your rulings, for you do not know what the Commander of the Believers has introduced into the rites after you.’ (Abu Musa said:) ‘Then when I met him later on, I asked him.’ ‘Umar said: ‘I know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions did it, but I did not like that people should lie with their wives in the shade of the Arak trees and then go out for Hajj with their heads dripping,’ (i.e. due to the bath after sexual relations).”
2980 | It was narrated that Jabir bin ‘Abdullah said:“We began our Talbiyah for Hajj only with Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ), and we did not mix it with ‘Umrah. We arrived in Makkah when four nights of Dhul-Hijjah had passed, and when we had performed Tawaf around the Ka’bah and Sa’y between Safa and Marwah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to make it ‘Umrah, and to come out of Ihram and have relations with our wives. We said: ‘There are only five (days) until ‘Arafah. Will we g out to it with our male organs dripping with semen?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘I am the most righteous and truthful among you, and were it not for the sacrificial animal, I would have exited Ihram.’ Suraqah bin Malik said: ‘Is this Tamattu’ for this year only or forever?’ He said: ‘No, it is forever and ever.’”
2981 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when there were five nights left of Dhul-Qa’dah, intending only to perform Hajj. When we came close, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered that whoever did not have a sacrificial animal, then he should exit the Ihram. So all the people exited Ihram, except those who had the sacrificial animal. When the Day of Sacrifice i.e., the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) came, some beef was brought to us, and it was said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has offered a sacrifice on behalf of his wives.’”
2982 | It was narrated that Bara’ bin ‘Azib said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions came out to us and we entered Ihram for Hajj. When we came to Makkah, he said: ‘Make your Hajj (to) ‘Umrah.’ The people said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, we have entered Ihram for Hajj, how can we make it ‘Umrah?’ He said: ‘Look at what I command you to do, and do it.’ They repeated their question and he got angry and went away. Then he entered upon ‘Aishah angry and she saw anger in his face, and said: ‘Who has made you angry? May Allah vex him!’ He said: ‘Why should I not get angry, when I give a command and it is not obeyed?’”
2983 | It was narrated that Asma’ bint Abi Bakr said:“We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in Ihram. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever has a sacrificial animal with him, let him remain in Ihram. Whoever does not have a sacrificial animal with him, let him exit Ihram.’ She said: ‘I did not have a sacrificial animal with me, so I exited Ihram, but Zubair had a sacrificial animal with him, so he did not exit Ihram. So I put on my regular clothes and came to Zubair, and he said: ‘Go away from me.’ I said: ‘Are you afraid I am going to jump on you?!’”
2984 | It was narrated from Harith bin Bilal bin Harith, that his father said:“I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, do you think that this cancellation of Hajj and it being replaced with ‘Umrah is only for us, or for all people?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘No, it is only for us.’”
2985 | It was narrated that Abu Dharr said:“Tamattu’ in Hajj was for the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) specifically.”
2986 | It was narrated that Hisham bin ‘Urwah said:“My father told me: ‘I said to ‘Aishah: “I do not think there is any sin on me if I do not perform Tawaf* between Safa and Marwah.” She said: “Allah says: ‘Verily, Safa and Marwah are of the Symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or ‘Umrah of the House to perform Tawaf between them.’” [2:158] If the matter were as you say, then it would have said, ‘it is not a sin on him to not perform the Sa’y between them.’ Rather this was revealed concerning some people among the Ansar who previously, when they stated the Talbiyah, they used to recite it for Manat, and it was not lawful for them to perform Sa’y between Safa and Marwah. When they arrived with the Prophet (ﷺ) for Hajj, they mentioned that to him, and Allah revealed this Verse. By Allah, Allah will not accept the Hajj as complete if one who does not perform Sa’y between Safa and Marwah.’”
2987 | It was narratd that an Umm Walad* of Shaibah said:“I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performing Sa’y between Safa and Marwah saying: ‘The valley should not be crossed except quickly.’”
2988 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“If I go quickly between Safa and Marwah, that is because I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) going quickly, and if I walk that is because I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) walking, even though I am an old man.”
2989 | It was narrated from Talhah bin ‘Ubaidullah that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say:“Hajj is Jihad and ‘Umrah is voluntary.”
2990 | Isma’il narrated:“I heard ‘Abdullah bin Abu Awfa say: ‘We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he performed ‘Umrah. He performed Tawaf (around the Ka’bah) and we performed Tawaf with him.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever among you wants to begin the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah, let him do so. If it were not for the fact that I have brought a sacrificial animal with me, I would have began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah.’” She said: “Some of the people began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah, and some began the Talbiyah for Hajj. I was one of those who began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah.” She said: “We set out until we reached Makkah, then the Day of ‘Arafah came while I was in menses, but I did not exit Ihram for ‘Umrah I complained about that to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: ‘Leave your ‘Umrah, undo your hair and comb it, and begin the Talbiyah for Hajj.’” She said: “So I did that, then on the night of Hasbah (i.e., the twelfth night of Dhul-Hijjah), when Allah had enables us to complete our Hajj, he sent ‘Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr with me. He seated me behind him and went out to Tan’im, then I began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah and Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj and ‘Umrah, and there was no sacrificial animal, charity nor fasting.”

He (the narrator) said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) laughed,” or he said, “He smiled. Abu Bakr and ‘Umar said to him: ‘May my father and mother be ransomed for you, this is not a time when you usually laugh. What made you laugh, may Allah make your years filled with laughter?’ He said: ‘The enemy of Allah, Iblis, when he came to know that Allah answered my prayer and forgiven my nation, took some dust and started to sprinkle it on his head, uttering cries of woe and doom, and what I saw of his anguish made me laugh.’”

Whoever comes before Fajr prayer on the night of Jam’, he has completed his Hajj. The days at Mina are three. ‘But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him.’” [2:203] Then he seated a man behind him on his mount and he started calling out these words.’”  Another chain reports a similar hadith.
3016 | It was narrated from ‘Urwah bin Mudarris At-Ta’i that he performed Hajj during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he did not catch up with the people until they were at Jam’ (Al-Muzdalifah).

By Allah, there is no sand hill on which I did not stand. Have I performed Hajj?’ The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever attended the prayer (i.e., Fajr at Muzdalifah) with us and departed from ‘Arafat, by night or day, may remove the dirt and has completed his Hajj.’”

No sinner commits a sin but it is against himself. No father is to be punished for the sins of his child, and no child is to be punished for the sins of his father. Satan has despaired of ever being worshipping in this land of yours, but he will be obeyed in some matters which you regard as insignificant, and he will be content with that. All the blood feuds of the Ignorance days are abolished, and the first of them that I abolish is the blood feud of Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib, who was nursed among Banu Laith and killed by Hudhail. All the usuries of the Ignorance days are abolished, but you will have your capital. Do not wrong others and you will not be wronged. O my nation, have I conveyed (the message)?’ (He asked this) three times. They said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘O Allah, bear witness!’ three times.”
3056 | It was narrated from Muhammad bin Jubair bin Mut’im that his father said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up in Khaif in Mina, and said: ‘May Allah make his face shine, the man who hears my words and conveys them. It may be that the bearer of knowledge does not understand it, and it may be that he takes it to one who will understand it more than he does. There are three things in which the heart of the believer does not betray: sincerity of action for the sake of Allah, offering sincere advice to the rulers of the Muslims, and adhering to the Jama’ah (main body of the Muslims). Their supplication is answered (i.e. encompassing every good, and all of the people).”
3057 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, when he was atop his camel with the clipped ears in ‘Arafat: ‘Do you know what day this is, what month this is and what land this is?’ They said: ‘This is a sacred land, a sacred month and a sacred day.’ He said: ‘Your wealth and your blood are sacred to you as this month of yours, in this land of yours, on this day of yours. I will reach the Cistern (Hawd) before you, and I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations, so do not blacken my face (i.e., cause me to be ashamed). I will rescue some people, and some people will be taken away from me. I will say: “O Lord, my companions!” and He will say: “You do not know what innovations they introduced after you were gone.’”

When you have finished, then praise Allah.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘The sign (that differentiates) between us and the hypocrites is that they do not drink their fill from Zamzam.”
3062 | It was narrated that Jabir bin ‘Abdullah said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.’”
3063 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered the Ka’bah on the Day of the Conquest (of Makkah), with Bilal and ‘Uthman bin Shaibah, and they locked the door behind them from the inside. When they came out, I asked Bilal: ‘Where did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pray?’ He told me that when he entered, he turned to his right and prayed in the direction that he was facing, between the two columns.”
3064 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out delighted, then he came back to me sad. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, (why did) you go out happy and come back sad?’ He said: ‘I entered the Ka’bah, and I wish that I had not done that, because I am afraid that I may have caused difficulty for my nation after I am gone.’”
3065 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“Abbas bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for permission to stay overnight in Makkah on the nights of Mina for the purpose of supplying water to the pilgrims, and he gave him permission.
3066 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) did not allow anyone to stay overnight in Makkah apart from ‘Abbas, for the purpose of supplying water to the pilgrims.”
3067 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“Staying in Abtah is not Sunnah; the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) only stayed there because it was more convenient for his departure.”
3068 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) set out before daybreak, on the night of departure, from Batha’.”
3069 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthman used to stay at Abtah.”
3070 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“The people were going in all directions, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘No one should depart until the last thing he does is (Tawaf around) the House.’”
3071 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade a man to depart until the last thing he did was (Tawaf around) the House.”
3072 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“Safiyyah bint Huyai got her menses after she had done Tawaful-Ifadah.” ‘Aishah said: “I mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: ‘Has she detained us?’ I said: ‘She performed Tawaful-Ifadah then she got her menses after that.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Then let her depart.’”
3073 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned Safiyyah and we said: ‘She has got her menses.’ He said: ‘ ‘Aqra Halqa!* I think that she has detained us.’ I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, she performed Tawaful-Ifadah on the Day of Sacrifice.’ He said: ‘No then, tell her to depart.’”
3074 | Ja’far bin Muhammad narrated that his father said:“We entered upon Jabir bin ‘Abdullah, and when we reached him he asked about the people (i.e., what their names were, etc.). When he reached me, I said: ‘I am Muhammad bin ‘Ali bin Husain.’ He stretched forth his hand towards my head, and undid my top button, then undid my lower button. Then he placed his hand on my chest, and I was a young boy at that time. Then he said: ‘Welcome to you, ask whatever you want.’ So I asked him, and he was blind. The time for prayer came, so he stood up, wrapping himself in a woven cloth. Every time he put it on his shoulders, its edges came up, because it was too small. And his cloak was beside him on a hook. He led us in prayer, then he said: ‘Tell us about the Hajj of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ He held up his hands, showing nine (fingers), and said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stayed for nine years without performing Hajj, then it was announced to the people in the tenth year that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was going for Hajj. So many people came to Al-Madinah, all of them seeking to follow the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do what he did. He set out and we set out with him, and we came to Dhul-Hulaifah where Asma’ bint ‘Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abu Bakr. She sent word to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asking what she should do. He said: “Perform Ghusl, fasten a cloth around your waist and enter Ihram.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed in the mosque, then he rode Qaswa’ (his she-camel) until, when his she-camel arose with him upon Baida’,’ Jabir said: ‘As far as I could see, I saw people riding and walking in front of him, and I saw the same to his right and left, and behind him, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was among us and Qur’an was being revealed to him, and he understood its meaning. Whatever he did, we did too. Then he began the Talbiyah of monotheism: “Labbaika Allahumma labbaik, labbaika la sharika laka labbaik. Innal-hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal-mulk, la sharika laka (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).” And the people repeated his words. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) approved of that. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) continued to recite the Talbiyah.’ Jabir said: ‘We did not intend (to do) anything but Hajj. We were not aware of ‘Umrah. Then when we reached the House with him, he touched the Corner, and walked quickly (Ramal) for three circuits and walked (normally) for four. Then he stood at the place of Ibrahim and said: “And take you (people) the place of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.” [2:125] He stood with the place between him and the House. My father used to say:* “And I do not think that he mentioned it other than from the Prophet (ﷺ): ‘That he used to recite in those two Rak’ah (at the place of Ibrahim): “Say: ‘O you disbelievers!’” [Al-Kafirun (109)] and “Say: ‘He is Allah, (the) One.’” [Al-Ikhlas (112)] “Then he went back to the House and touched the Corner, then he went out through the gate to Safa. When he drew near to Safa he recited: “Verily, Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah,” [2:158] (and said:) “We will start with that with which Allah started.” So he started with Safa and climbed it until he could see the House, then proclaimed the greatness of Allah (by saying: Allahu Akbar) and said Tahlil (La ilaha illallah) and praised Him (saying Al-Hamdulillah), and he said: “La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu, yuhyi wa yumit wa huwa ‘ala kulli shai’in Qadir. La ilaha illallah wahdahu, La sharika lahu anjaza wa’dahu, wa nasara ‘abduhu, wa hazamal-Ahzaba wahdahu (None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone, with no partner or associate; His is the dominion, all praise is due to Him, He gives life and causes death and He is able to do all things. None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone; He has no partner or associate, He fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His slave, and defeated the Confederates alone).” And he said that three times, supplication in between. Then he headed towards Marwah walking normally until, when he started to go downhill, he walked quickly (Ramal) in the bottom of the valley. When he started to go uphill, he walked normally, until he reached Marwah, and he did atop Marwah what he had done atop Safa. At the end of his Sa’y, atop Marwah he said: “If I had known before what I have come to know now, I would not have garlanded the sacrificial animal, and I would have made it ‘Umrah. Whoever among you does not have a sacrificial animal with him, let him exit Ihram and make it ‘Umrah.” So all the people exited Ihram and cut their hair, except the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had sacrificial animals with them. Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju’shum stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah! Is this for this year only, or forever and ever?” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) interlaced his fingers and said: “‘Umrah is included in Hajj like this,” twice. “No, it is forever and ever.” ‘Ali brought the camels of the Prophet (ﷺ), and he found that Fatimah was one of those who had exited Ihram. She had put on a dyed garment and used kohl. ‘Ali disliked this action on her part, but she said: “My father told me to do this.” ‘Ali used to say in Iraq: “So I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), feeling upset with Fatimah because of what she had done, to ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about what she had said that he said, and that I had disliked that. He said: ‘She spoke the truth, she spoke the truth. What did you say when you began your Hajj?’” He said: “I said: ‘O Allah, I begin the Talbiyah for that for which your Messenger (ﷺ) begins the Talbiyah.’ (He said:) ‘And I have the sacrificial animal with me, so do not exit Ihram.’ He said: “The total number of sacrificial animals that ‘Ali had brought from Yemen and that the Prophet (ﷺ) brought from Al-Madinah were one hundred. Then all the people exited Ihram and cut their hair, apart from the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had sacrificial animals with them. When the day of Tarwiyah came (the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah), they headed for Mina and began the Talbiyah for Hajj. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode. He prayed Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Isha’ and Fajr at Mina. Then he stayed for a short while until the sun rose, and he ordered that a tent of goat hair be pitched for him in Namirah. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out, and the Quraish were certain that he was going to stay at Al-Mash’ar Haram or at Al-Muzdalifah, as Quraish used to do during the Ignorance days. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) continued until he came to ‘Arafat, where he found that the tent had been pitched for him in Namirah, and he stopped there. Then when the sun had passed its zenith, he called for Qaswa’ and she was saddled for him. He rode until he came to the bottom of the valley, and he addressed the people and said: ‘Your blood and your wealth are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Every matter of Ignorance days is abolished, beneath these two feet of mine. The blood feuds of the Ignorance days are abolished, and the first blood feud of Rabi’ah bin Harith, who was nursed among Banu Sa’d and killed by Hudhail. The usuries of Ignorance days are abolished, and the first usury (that I abolish) is our usury, the usury due to ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib. It is all abolished. Fear Allah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah, and intimacy with them has become permissible to you through Allah’s Word. Your rights over them are that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to sit on your bedding.** If they do that, then hit them, but in a manner that does not cause injury or leave a mark. Their rights over you are that you should provide for them and clothe them in a reasonable manner. I have left behind you something which, if you adhere to it, you will never go astray: the Book of Allah. You will be asked about me. What will you say?’ They said: ‘We bear witness that you have conveyed (the message) and fulfilled (your duty) and offered sincere advice.’ He gestured with his forefinger towards the sky and then towards the people, (and said:) ‘O Allah, bear witness, O Allah bear witness,’ three times. Then Bilal called the Adhan, then the Iqamah, and he prayed Zuhr. Then he made Iqamah and prayed ‘Asr, and he did not offer any prayer between them. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode until he came to the place of standing, and he made his she-camel face Sakharat*** with the path in the sand in front of him, and he faced the Qiblah, then he remained standing until the sun had set and the afterglow had lessened somewhat, when the disk of the sun disappeared. Then he seated Usamah bin Zaid behind him and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out. He pulled Qaswa’s reins tight until her head was touching the saddle, and he gestured with his right hand: ‘O people, calmly, calmly!’ Every time he came to a hill, he released the reins a little so that she could climb. Then he came to Muzdalifah where he prayed Maghrib and ‘Isha’ with one Adhan and two Iqamah, offering no prayer in between. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lay down until dawn came, and he prayed Fajr, when he saw that morning had come, with one Adhan and one Iqamah. Then he rode Qaswa’ until he came to Al-Mash’ar Al-Haram. He climbed it and praised Allah and proclaimed His greatness and that He is the only One worthy of worship. Then he remained standing until it had become quite bright, then he moved on before the sun rose. He seated Fadl bin ‘Abbas behind him, who was a man with lovely hair, white and handsome. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) moved on, he passed some women riding camels. Fadl started to look at them, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) put his hand on the other side. Fadl turned his face to the other side to look. When he came to Muhassir, he sped up a little. Then he followed the middle road that brings you out to the biggest Pillar, until he reached the Pillar that is by the tree. He threw seven pebbles, saying the Takbir with each throw, pebbles suitable for Khadhf (i.e., the size of a chickpea) throwing from the bottom of the valley. Then he went to the place of slaughter, and slaughtered sixty-three camels with his own hand. Then he handed it over to ‘Ali who slaughtered the rest, and he gave him a share in his sacrificial animal. Then he ordered that a piece from each camel be brought; (the pieces) were put in a pot and cooked, and they (the Prophet (ﷺ) and ‘Ali) ate from the meat and drank from the soup. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) hastened to the House, and prayed Zuhr in Makkah. He came to Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib, who were providing water to the pilgrims at Zamzam, and said: ‘Draw me some water, O Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib. Were it not that the people would overwhelm you, I would have drawn water with you.’ So they drew up a bucket for him and he drank from it.’”   * It appears that the speaker is Ja’far bin Muhammad who is narrating from his father, from Jabir.  **And they say that the meaning if ‘your furniture’ or, ‘your special place’ in which case the objective is to say that the wife is not to admit anyone in the house whom the husband would be displeased with. ***Sakharat plural of Sakhrah rock or boulder. Nawawi said: “They are the rocks that lay at the base of the Mount of Mercy, and it is the mount in the middle of ‘Arafat.”
3075 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for Hajj in three ways. Some of us began the Talbiyah for Hajj and ‘Umrah together, some of us began the Talbiyah for Hajj on its own, and some of us began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah on its own. Those who began the Talbiyah for Hajj and ‘Umrah together did not exit Ihram at all until they had completed the rites of Hajj. Those who began the Talbiyah for Hajj on its own did not exit ihram at all until they had completed the rites of Hajj. And those who began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah on its own circumambulated the House and ran between Safa and Marwah, then whatever had been forbidden to them became permissible until the time for Hajj came.”
3076 | Sufyan said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed Hajj three times, twice before he emigrated, and once after he had emigrated, and once after he had emigrated to Al-Madinah. He performed ‘Umrah along with his Hajj. The total number of camels brought by the Prophet (ﷺ) and ‘Ali was one hundred. Among them was a (male) camel belonging to Abu Jahl, which had a silver ring in its nose. The Prophet (ﷺ) slaughtered sixty-three with his own hand, and ‘Ali slaughtered the rest.”
3077 | It was narrated from ‘Ikrimah:“Hajjaj bin ‘Amr Ansari narrated to me, he said: ‘I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: “Whoever breaks a bone or becomes lame, has exited Ihram, but he must perform another Hajj.”
3078 | It was narrated from ‘Ikrimah, from ‘Abdullah bin Rafi’, the freed slave of Umm Salamah, that he said:“I asked Hajjaj bin ‘Amr about a Muhrim being prevented (from completing Hajj). He said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever breaks a bone, falls sick or becomes lame, has exited Ihram, and he has to perform Hajj the following year.”  'Ikrimah (a subnarrator) said: I narrated it to Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Hurairah. They said he spoke the truth.
3079 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Ma’qil said:“I sat with Ka’b bin ‘Ujrah in the mosque and asked him about this Verse: ‘He must pay a compensation of either fasting (three days) or giving charity (feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep).’ [2:196] Ka’b said: it was revealed concerning me. I had trouble with my head, so I was carried to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), with lice crawling on my face. He said: ‘I did not think that you were suffering as much as I see. Do you have a sheep?’ I said: ‘No.’ Then this Verse was revealed: “He must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either fasting (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity – feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep).” [2:196] He said: ‘Fasting is three days, charity is to be given to six poor persons, giving each one half of a Sa’ of food, and the sacrifice is a sheep.’”
3080 | It was narrated that Ka’b bin ‘Ujrah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded me, when I was suffering, from live, to shave my head and fast for three days or feed six poor persons. He knew that I did not have an animal I could sacrifice.”
3081 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (ﷺ) was treated with cupping when he was fasting and in the state of Ihram.
3082 | It was narrated from Jabir that the Prophet (ﷺ) was treated with cupping when he was in the state of Ihram, because he did not feel well.
3083 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (ﷺ) used to put oil on his head when he was in the state of Ihram, but not oil that was perfumed.
3084 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that a man’s neck was broken by his mount (from falling) while he was in the state of Ihram. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Wash him with water and lote leaves, and shroud him in his two garments, but do not cover his face or his head, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.”  Another chain reports the same except a different verb was used for the break of the neck and he said "do not bring him near perfume, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.”
3085 | It was narrated that Jabir said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stipulated (the penalty of) a man for a hyena killed by a man in Ihram, and he considered it as game.”
3086 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, concerning an ostrich egg taken by a Muhrim:“Its cost (must be paid as a penalty).”
3087 | It was narrated from ‘Aishah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“There are five vermin that might be killed whether one is in or outside the sacred precincts: the snake, the speckled crow, the mouse, the vicious dog, and the kite.”

3089 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:‘The one in Ihram may kill the snake, the scorpion, the aggressive predator, the vicious dog and the harmful mouse.” It was said to him: “Why is it said that they are harmful?” He said:* “Because the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) woke up because of one, and it had taken the wick (of the lamp) to burn down the house.”
3090 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“Sa;b bin Jaththamah told us: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed by me when I was in Abwa’ or Waddan, and I gave him some meat of a wild donkey, but he gave it back to me, and when he saw from my face that I was upset, he said: ‘The only reason that we are giving it back is that we are in Ihram.’”
3091 | It was narrated that ‘Ali bin Abu Talib said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) brought some meat from some game when he was in Ihram, and he did not eat it.”
3092 | It was narrated from Talhah bin ‘Ubaidullah that the Prophet (ﷺ) gave him some wild donkey meat, and told him to distribute it among his Companions, who were in Ihram.
3093 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin Abu Qatadah that his father said:“I went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the time of Hudaibiyah, and his Companions entered Ihram, but I did not. I saw a donkey do I hunted it. I mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him: ‘I had not entered Ihram, and I was hunting it for you.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) told his Companions to eat it, but he did not eat from it, because I told him that I had hunted it for him.”
3094 | ‘Aishah the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) said; “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to send the sacrificial animal from Al-Madinah, and I would twist the garlands for his sacrificial animal, then, he would not (because of that) avoid the things that the one in Ihram avoids.”
3095 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“I used to twist the garlands for the sacrificial animal of the Prophet (ﷺ), and his sacrificial animal would be garlanded and sent (to Makkah), and he would stay (in Al-Madinah) without avoiding any of the things that the one in Ihram avoids.”
3096 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“On one occasion the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent sheep to the House, and he garlanded them.”

3105 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that Dhu’aib Al-Khuza’i narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) used to send the sacrificial animals with him, then he would say:“If any of them becomes unfit and you are afraid that it will die, then slaughter it, dip the sandal (tied around its neck) in its blood and place it on its side, but neither you nor any of your companions should eat anything from it.”
3106 | It was narrated that Najiyah Al-Khuza’i – in his narration, ‘Amr (one of the narrators) said that he was the one who looked after the sacrificial animals of the Prophet (ﷺ) – said:“I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what should I do with those sacrificial animals that become unfit?’ He said: ‘Slaughter them, dip its sandal in its blood, then place it on its side, and leave them for the people to eat.’”
3107 | It was narrated that ‘Alqamah bin Nadlah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), Abu Bakr and ‘Umar died, and the houses in Makkah were still called free. Whoever needed to, lived there, and whoever had no need of them allowed others to live there (without asking for rent).”

By Allah, had I not been expelled from you I would never have left.’”  *A place in Makkah.
3109 | It was narrated that Safiyyah bint Shaibah said:“I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) delivering a sermon in the Year of the Conquest (of Makkah), and he said: ‘O people, Allah made Makkah sacred the day He created the heavens and the earth, and it is sacred until the Day of Resurrection. Its trees are not to be cut, its game is not to be disturbed, and its lost property is not to be taken except by one who will announce it.’‘Abbas said: ‘Except for Idhkhir (a kind of fragrant grass), for it is (used) for houses and graves.’ The messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Except for Idhkhir.’”
3110 | It was narrated from ‘Ayyash bin Abu Rabi’ah (Makhzumi) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘The goodness of this nation will not cease as long as they revere this sanctuary* as it is due. But when they lose that reverence, they will be doomed.”

But, they did not move it. Then, he stood up just as he was and went out.”
3117 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever is in Makkah when the month of Ramadan comes, and he fasts it and prays at night as much as he can, Allah will record for him (reward equivalent to that for) one hundred thousand months of Ramadan observed elsewhere.

3120 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to sacrifice two horned, black-and-white rams and he would say the Name of Allah and pronounce His greatness. I saw him slaughtering them with his own hand, putting his foot on their sides.”
3121 | It was narrated that Jabir bin ‘Abdullah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sacrificed two rams on the Day of ‘Eid. When he turned them to face towards the prayer direction he said: ‘Verily, I have turned my face towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, as a monotheist, and I am not of the polytheists. Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists. He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. [6:79,162-163] O Allah, from You to You, on behalf of Muhammad and his nation.’”
3122 | It was narrated from ‘Aishah and Abu Hurairah that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wanted to offer a sacrifice, he brought two large, fat, horned, black-and-white, castrated rams.

He said: ‘What is this?’ I said: ‘An amulet against erysipelas.’ He pulled it, broke it and threw it away, and said: ‘The family of ‘Abdullah has no need of polytheism.’ I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “Ruqyah (i.e., which consist of the names of idols and devils etc.), amulets and Tiwalah (charms) are polytheism.’” “I said: ‘I went out one day and so-and-so looked at me, and my eye began to water on the side nearest him. When I recited Ruqyah for it, it stopped, but if I did not recite Ruqyah it watered again.’ He said: ‘That is Satan, if you obey him he leaves you alone but if you disobey him he pokes you with his finger in your eye. But if you do what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do, that will be better for you and more effective in healing. Sprinkle water in your eye and say: Adhhibil-bas Rabban-nas, washfi Antash-Shafi, la shifa’a illa shafi’uka, shafi’an la yughadiru saqaman (Take away the pain, O Lord of mankind, and grant healing, for You are the Healer, and there is no healing but Your healing that leaves no trace of sickness).’”

He has been afflicted and cannot speak.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Bring me some water.’ So it was brought, and he washed his hands and rinsed out his mouth.

O ‘Aishah. It was as if its water was infused with henna and its date palms were like the heads of devils.’” She said: “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, why don’t you burn them?’ He said: ‘As for me, Allah has healed me, and I do not like to let evil spread among the people.’ Then he issued orders that the well be filled up with earth.”

3865 | It was narrated from Salman that the :Prophet (saas) said: "Your Lord is Kind and Most Generous, and is too kind to let His slave, if he raises his hands to Him, bring them back empty," or he said "frustrated."

His is the dominion and all praise is to Him, and He is Able to all things)' - he will have (a reward) equal to freeing a slave among the sons of Isma'il, ten bad deeds will be erased from (his record), he will be raised (in status) ten degrees, and he will have protection against Satan until evening comes.  When evening comes, (if he says likewise) he will have the same until morning comes.'"

Allahum-mastur 'awrati, wa amin raw'ati wahfazni min bayni yadayya, wa min khalfi, wa 'an yamini wa 'an shimali, wa min fawqi, wa 'audhu bika an ughtala min tahti (O Allah, I ask You for forgiveness and well-being in this world and in the Hereafter. O Allah, I ask You for forgiveness and well-being in my religious and my worldly affairs.  O Allah, conceal my faults, calm my fears, and protect me from before me and behind me, from my right and my left, and from above me, and I seek refuge in You from being taken unaware from beneath me)." Waki' (one of the narrators, explaining) said: "Meaning Al-Khasf (disgrace)."
3872 | It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Buraidah that :his father said: "The Messenger of Allah (saas) said: Allahumma Anta Rabbi la ilaha illa Anta, khalaqtani wa ana 'abduka wa ana 'ala 'ahdika wa wa'dika mastata'tu. A'udhu bika min sharri ma sana'tu, abu'u bi ni'matika wa abu'u bi dhanbi faghfirli, fa innahu la yaghfirudh-dhunuba illa Anta (O Allah, You are my Lord, there is none worthy of worship except You. You have created me and I am Your slave, and I am adhering to Your covenant and Your promise as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from the evil of what I do.  I acknowledge Your blessing and I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me, for there is none who can forgive sin except You)."He said: "The Messenger of Allah (saas) said: 'Whoever says this by day and by night, if he dies that day or that night, he will enter Paradise if Allah wills."
3873 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that :when going to bed, the Prophet (saas) used to say: "Allahumma Rabbas-samawati wa Rabbal-ardi, wa Rabba kulli shay'in, faliqal-habbi wan-nawa, munzilat-Tawrati wal-Injili wal-Qur'anil-'Azim. A'udhu bika min sharri kulli dabbatin Anta akhidhun binasiyatiha, Antal-Awwalu fa laysa qablaka shayun, wa Antal-Akhiru, fa laysa ba'daka shayun', Antaz-zahiru, fa laysa fawqaka shayun', wa antal-batinu fa laysa dunaka shay', aqdi 'annid-dayna waghnini minal-faqr (O Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth and Lord of all things, Cleaver of the seed and the kernel, Revealer of the Tawrah, the Injil and the Magnificent Qur'an, I seek refuge with You from the evil of every creature You seize by the forelock. You are the First and there is nothing before You; You are the Last and there is nothing after You; You are the Most High (Az-Zahir) and there is nothing above You, and You are the Most Near (Al-Batin) and there is nothing nearer than You. Settle my debt for me and spare me from poverty)."
3874 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that:the Messenger of Allah (saas) said: "When anyone of you wants to go to bed, let him undo the edge of his Izar (waist wrap) and dust of his bed with it, for he does not know what came to it after him. Then let him lie down on his right side and say: 'Rabbi bika wada'tu janbi wa bika arfa'uhu, fa in amsakta nafsi farhamha, wa in arsaltaha fahfazha bima hafizta bihi 'ibadikaas-salihin (O Lord, by Your leave I lie down and by Your leave I rise, so if You should take my soul then have mercy on it, and if You should return my soul then protect it as You protect Your righteous slaves)."
3875 | It was narrated from 'Aishah that:whenever the Prophet (saas) went to bed, he would blow into his hands, recite Al-Mu'awwidhatain, then wipe his hands over his body.
3876 | It was narrated from Bara' bin 'Azib that :the Prophet (saas) said to a man: "When you go to lay down, or go to your bed, say: Allahumma aslamtu wajhi ilayka, wa al-ja'tu zahri ilayka, wa fawwadtu amri ilayka, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilayka, la malja'a wa la manja'a minka illa ilayka, amantu bi kitabikal-ladhi anzalta, wa nabiyyikal arsalta [O Allah, I have submitted my face (i.e., myself) to You, and I am under Your command (i.e., I depend upon You in all my affairs), and I put my trust in You, hoping for Your reward and fearing Your punishment. There is no fleeing from You and no refuge from You except with You. I believe in Your Book that You have revealed and in Your Prophet whom You have sent).' Then if you die that night, you will die in a state of the Fitrah (nature), and if you wake in the morning you will wake with a great deal of good."
3877 | It was narrated from 'Abdullah that:whenever the Prophet (saas) went to his bed, he would put his hand - meaning his right hand - beneath his cheek then say: "Allahumma qini 'adhabaka yawm tab'athu - [or: tajma'u] - 'ibadaka (O Allah, save me from Your punishment on the Day when You resurrect - or gather - Your slaves)."
3878 | It was narrated that ‘Ubadah bin As-Samit said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever wakes up in the morning and says upon waking: La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in Qadir; Subhan-Allah walhamdu lillahi, wa la ilaha illallahu, wa Allahu Akbar, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billahil-‘Aliyil-‘Azim (None has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the dominion and all praise is to Him, and He is Able to do all things. Glory is to Allah, praise is to Allah, none has the right to be worshiped but Allah, Allah is the Most Great, and there is no power and no strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Supreme), then he supplicates Rabbighfirli (O Lord, forgive me), he will be forgiven.’” Walid said: “Or he said: then if he supplicated, it will be answered for him then if he stood up and performed ablution and then performed prayer, his prayer would be accepted.”
3879 | Rabi’ah bin Ka’b Al-Aslami narrated that he used to spend the night outside the door of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he used to hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying at night:“Subhan Allahi Rabbil-‘alamin (Glory is to Allah, the Lord of the worlds),” repeating that for a while, then he said: Subhan Allahi wa bihamdihi (Glory and praise is to Allah).”
3880 | It was narrated that Hudhaifah said:“Whenever the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) woke up in the morning, he would say: ‘Al-hamdu lillahil-ladhi ahyana ba’dama amatana wa ilayhi’n-nushur (Praise is to Allah Who has given us life after taking it from us, and unto Him is the Resurrection).’”
3881 | It was narrated from Mu’adh bin Jabal that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There is no person who goes to bed in a state of purity, then wakes up at night, and asks Allah for something in this world or the Hereafter, but it will be given to him.”
3882 | It was narrated that Asma’ bint ‘Umais said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught me some words to say at times of distress: Allah! Allahu Rabbi la ushriku bihi shay’an (Allah, Allah is my Lord, I do not associate anything with Him).”
3883 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (ﷺ) used to say at times of distress:“La ilaha illallahul-Halimul-Karim, Subhan-Allahi Rabbil-‘Arshil-‘Azim, Subhan-Allahi Rabbil-samawatis-sab’i wa Rabbil-‘Arshil-Azim (None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, the Forbearing, the Most Generous; glory is to Allah the Lord of the Mighty Throne; glory is to Allah, the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Magnificent Throne).” Waki’ said with each wording La ilaha illallahu (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) is to be included.
3884 | It was narrated from Umm Salamah that whenever he left his house, the Prophet (ﷺ) would say:“Allahumma inni a’udhu bika an adilla aw azilla, aw azlima aw uzlama, aw ajhala aw yujhala ‘alayya (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from going astray or stumbling, from wronging others or being wronged, and from behaving or being treated in an ignorant manner).”
3885 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that whenever he left his house, the Prophet (ﷺ) would say:“Bismillah, la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah, at-tuklanu ‘ala Allah (In the Name of Allah, there is no power and strength except with Allah, and trust is placed in Allah).”
3886 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“When a man goes out of the door of his house, there are two angels with him who are appointed over him. If he says Bismillah (in the Name of Allah) they say: ‘You have been guided.’ If he says La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah), they say: ‘You are protected.’ If he says, Tawwakaltu ‘ala Allah (I have my trust in Allah), they say: ‘You have been taken care of.’ Then his two Qarins (satans) come to him and they (the two angels) say: ‘What do you want with a man who has been guided, protected and taken care of?’”
3887 | It was narrated from Jabir bin ‘Abdullah that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say:“When a man enters his house, and remembers Allah when he enters and when he eats, Satan says: ‘You have no place to stay and no supper.’ If he enters his house and does not remember Allah upon entering, Satan says: ‘You have found a place to stay.’ And if he does not remember Allah when he eats, (Satan) says: ‘You have found a place to stay and supper.’”
3888 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin Sarjis said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say” – and (one of the narrators) ‘Abdur-Rahim said: “he used to seek refuge” – “when he traveled: ‘Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min wa’tha’is-safar, wa ka’abatil-munqalab, wal-hawri ba’dal-kawr, wa da’watil-mazlum, wa su’il-manzari fil-ahli wal-mal (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the hardships of travel and the sorrows of return, from decrease after increase, from the prayer of the one who has been wronged, and seeing some calamity befall my family or wealth).’” (One of the narrators) Abu Mu’awiyah added: “And when he returned he said likewise.”
3889 | ‘Aishah narrated that when the Prophet (ﷺ) saw a cloud approaching from any horizon, he would stop what he was doing, even if he was praying, and turn to face it, then he would say:“Allahumma inna na’udhu bika min sharri ma ursila bihi (O Allah, we seek refuge with You from the evil of that with which it is sent).” Then if it rained he would say: “Allahumma sayyiban nafi’an (O Allah, a beneficial rain),” two or three times. And if Allah dispelled it and it did not rain, he would praise Allah for that.
3890 | It was narrated from ‘Aishah that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw rain, he would say:“Allahumma aj’alhu sayyiban hani’an (O Allah, make it a wholesome rain cloud).”
3891 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“If the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw a cloud that looked as if it was bringing rain, the color of his face would change, and he would go in and out and walk to and fro. Then, if it rained, he would feel relieved.” ‘Aishah mentioned to him what she had seen him do, and he said: “How do you know? Perhaps it would be as the people of Hud said: ‘Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said: “This is a cloud bringing us rain!” Nay, but it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened.” [46:24]
3892 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever unexpectedly comes across a person suffering a calamity, and says: Al-hamdu Lillahil-ladhi ‘afani mim-mabtalaka bihi, wa faddalani ‘ala kathirin mimman khalaqa tafdila (Praise is to Allah Who has kept me safe from that which has afflicted you and preferred me over many of those whom He has created), will be kept safe from that calamity, no matter what it is.’”

3899 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) drew aside the curtain when he was sick, and the rows (of worshippers) were behind Abu Bakr. He said: ‘O people, nothing of the glad tidings of prophecy is left except a good dream that a Muslim sees or is seen about him.’”

If any of you sees a dream that he likes, let him tell others of it if he wishes, but if he sees something that he dislikes, he should not tell anyone about it, and he should get up and perform prayer.”
3907 | It was narrated from Abu ‘Ubaidullah Muslim bin Mishkam, that ‘Awf bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Dreams are of three types: Some are terrifying things from Satan, aimed at causing grief to the son of Adam; some are things that a person is concerned with when he is awake, so he sees them in his dreams; and some are a part of the forty-six parts of prophecy.” He said: “I said to him: ‘Did you hear this from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?’ He said: ‘Yes, I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’”
3908 | It was narrated from Jabir bin ‘Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“If anyone of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him spit dryly to his left three times and seek refuge with Allah from Satan three times, and turn over onto his other side.”

And I saw a rope reaching up into heaven, and I saw you take hold of it and rise with it. Then another man took hold of it after you rose with it, then another man took hold of it after him and rose with it. Then a man took hold of it after him and it broke, then it was reconnected and he rose with it.’ Abu Bakr said: ‘Let me interpret it, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘Interpret it.’ He said: ‘As for the cloud giving shade, it is Islam, and the drops of honey and ghee that fall from it (represent) the Qur’an with its sweetness and softness. As for the people collecting that in their palms, some learn a lot of the Qur’an and some learn a little. As for the rope reaching up into heaven, it is the truth that you are following; you took hold of it and rose with it, then another man till take hold of it after you and rise with you, then another, who will rise with it, then another, but it will break and then he reconnected, then he will rise with it.’ He said: ‘You have got some of it right and some of it wrong.’ Abu Bakr said: ‘I adjure you O Messenger of Allah, tell me what I got right and what I got wrong.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Do not swear, O Abu Bakr.”*
3919 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“I was a young unmarried man at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and I used to stay overnight in the mosque. If any of us had seen a dream, he would tell it to the Prophet (ﷺ). I said: ‘O Allah, if there is any good in me before You, show me a dream that the Prophet (ﷺ) can interpret for me.’ So I went to sleep and I saw two angels who came to me and took me away. They were met by another angel who said: ‘Do not be alarmed,’ and they took me to Hell which was built like a well. In it were people, some of whom I recognized. Then they took me off to the right. In the morning I mentioned that to Hafsah, and Hafsah said that she told the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it, and he said: ‘Abdullah is a righteous man, if only he would pray more at night.’”
3920 | It was narrated that Kharashah bin Hurr said:“I came to Al-Madinah and sat with some old men in the mosque of the Prophet (ﷺ). Then an old man came, leaning on his stick, and the people said: ‘Whoever would like to look at a man from among the people of Paradise, let him look at this man.’ He stood behind a pillar and prayed two Rak’ah. I got up and went to him, and said to him: ‘Some of the people said such and such.’ He said: ‘Praise is to Allah. Paradise belongs to Allah and He admits whomsoever He wills to it. At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) I saw a dream in which a man came to me and said: “Let’s go.” So I went with him and he took me along a great road. A road was shown to me on the left and I wanted to follow it, but he said: “You are not one of its people.” Then a road was shown to me on the right, and I followed him until I reached a slippery mountain. He took me by the hand and helped me up. When I reached the top I could not stand firm. There was an iron pillar there with a golden ring at the top. He took my hand and helped me up until I reached the handhold, then he said: “Have you gotten a firm hold?” I said: “Yes.” Then he struck the pillar with his foot and I held tight to the pillar. I told this to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: "You have seen something good. The great road is the plain of gathering (on the Day of Resurrection). The road that you were shown on your left is the way of the people of Hell, and you are not one of its people. The road which you were shown on your right is the way of the people of Paradise. The slippery mountain is the place of the martyrs, and the handhold that you held on tight to is the handhold of Islam. Hold on tight to it until you die." I hope to be one of the people of Paradise,' and he was 'Abdullah bin Salam."
3921 | It was narrated from Abu Musa that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“In a dream I saw myself emigrating from Makkah to a land in which there were date-palm trees, and I thought that it was Yamamah or Hajar, but it was Al-Madinah, Yathrib. And I saw in this dream of mine that I was wielding a sword then it broke in the middle. That was what befell the believers on the Day of Uhud. Then I wielded it again and it was better than it had been before, and that is what Allah brought about of the Conquest and the regrouping of the believers. And I also saw cows, and by Allah it is good, for they are the group of the believers (who were martyred) on the Day of Uhud, and the goodness is that which Allah brought forth after that, and the reward of the truth which Allah brought us on the Day of Badr.”
3922 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“I saw wristbands of gold on my arms, so I blew into them, and I interpreted them as being these two liars, Musailimah and ‘Ansi.”
3923 | It was narrated that Qabus said:“Umm Fadl said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! It is as if I saw (in a dream) one of your limbs in my house.’ He said: ‘What you have seen is good. Fatimah will give birth to a boy and you will breastfeed him.’ Fatimah gave birth to Husain or Hasan, and I breastfed him with the milk of Qutham.’ She said: ‘I brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ) and placed him in his lap, and he urinated, so I struck him on the shoulder.” The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “You have hurt my son, may Allah have mercy on you.”
3924 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar concerning the dream of the Prophet (ﷺ) that he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) said:“I saw a black woman with disheveled hair, who left Al-Madinah and went to stay in Al- Mahya’ah, which is Juhfah. I interpreted it as referring to an epidemic in Al-Madinah which moved to Juhfah.”
3925 | It was narrated from Talhah bin ‘Ubaidullah that two men from Bali came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). They had become Muslim together, but one of them used to strive harder than the other. The one who used to strive harder went out to fight and was martyred. The other one stayed for a year longer, then he passed away. Talhah said:“I saw in a dream that I was at the gate of Paradise and I saw them (those two men). Someone came out of Paradise and admitted the one who had died last, then he came out and admitted the one who had been martyred. Then he came back to me and said: ‘Go back, for your time has not yet come.’” The next morning, Talhah told the people of that and they were amazed. News of that reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and they told him the story. He said: “Why are you so amazed at that?” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, the first one was the one who strove harder, then he was martyred, but the other one was admitted to Paradise before him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Did he not stay behind for a year?” They said: “Yes.” He said: “And did not Ramadan come and he fasted, and he offered such and such prayers during that year?” They said: “Yes.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “The difference between them is greater than the difference between heaven and earth.”

3927 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“I have been commanded to fight the people until they say: La ilaha illallah.

3928 | It was narrated from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“I have been commanded to fight the people until they say: La ilaha illallah. If they say: La ilaha illallah, then their blood and wealth are protected from me, except for a right that is due from it, and their reckoning will be with Allah.”
3929 | ‘Amr bin Aws narrated that his father, Aws, told him:“We were sitting with the Prophet (ﷺ) and he was narrating to us and reminding us, when a man came and spoke privately to him. He said: ‘Take him away and kill him.’ When the man turned away, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called him back and said: ‘Do you bear witness that none has the right to be worshiped but Allah?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Then go and let him go, for I have been commanded to fight the people until they say: La ilaha illallah, then if they do that, their blood and wealth are forbidden to me.’”
3930 | It was narrated from Sumait bin Sumair, that ‘Imran bin Husain said:“Nafi’ bin Azraq and his companions came and said: ‘You are doomed, O ‘Imran!’ He (‘Imran) said: ‘I am not doomed.’ They said: ‘Yes you are.’ I said: ‘Why am I doomed?’ They said: ‘Allah says: “And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e., worshipping others besides Allah), and the religion (worship) will be all for Allah Alone.”[8:39] He said: ‘We fought them until they were defeated and the religion was all for Allah Alone. If you wish, I will tell you a Hadith that I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ They said: ‘Did you (really) hear it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?’ He said: ‘Yes. I was with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he had sent an army of the Muslims to the idolaters. When they met them they fought them fiercely, and they (the idolaters) gave them their shoulders (i.e., turned and fled). A man among my kin attacked an idolator man with a spear, and when he was defeated he said: “I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I am a Muslim.” But he stabbed him and killed him. He came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I am doomed.” He said “What is it that you have done?” one or two times. He told him what he had done and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: “Why didn’t you cut open his belly and find out what was in his heart?” He said: “O Messenger of Allah, I wish I had cut open his belly and could have known what was in his heart.” He said: “You did not accept what he said, and you could not have known what was in his heart!” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent concerning him (that man), and a short while later he died. We buried him, but the following morning he was on the surface of the earth. They said: “Perhaps an enemy of his disinterred him.” So we buried him (again) and told our slaves to stand guard. But the following morning he was on the surface of the earth again then we said: ‘Perhaps the slaves dozed off.’ So we buried him (again) and stood guard ourselves, but the following morning he was on the surface of the earth (again). So we threw him into one of these mountain passes.’”
3930b | ,It was narrated from Sumait, from ‘Imran bin Husain who said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent us on a campaign, and a Muslim man attacked an idolater man.” And he mentioned the Hadith and added: “And the earth cast him out.

Your blood and your wealth are as sacred to you as this day of yours in this month of yours. Have I not conveyed (the message)?’ They said: ‘Yes.” He said: ‘O Allah, bear witness.’”
3932 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr said:“I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) circumambulating the Ka’bah and saying: ‘How good you are and how good your fragrance; how great you are and how great your sanctity.

When he finished we said (or they said): ‘O Messenger of Allah, you made the prayer lengthy today.’ He said: ‘I offered a prayer of hope and fear. I asked Allah for three things for my nation, and He granted me two and refused one. I asked Him not to let my nation be destroyed by enemies from without, and He granted me that. And I asked Him not to let them be destroyed by drowning, and He granted me that. And I asked Him not to let them be destroyed by fighting among themselves, but He refused that.’”
3952 | It was narrated from Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The earth was brought together for me so that I could see the east and the west, and I was given two treasures, the yellow (or the red) and the white – meaning gold and silver. And it was said to me: ‘Your dominion will extend as far as has been shown to you.’ I asked Allah for three things: That my nation would not be overwhelmed by famine that would destroy them all, and that they would not be rent by schism and fight one another, but it was said to me: ‘When I (Allah) issue My decree it cannot be revoked. But I will never cause your nation to be overwhelmed by famine that would destroy them all, and I will not gather their enemies against them (and destroy them) until they annihilate one another and kill one another.’ Once they start to fight amongst themselves, that will continue until the Day of Resurrection. What I fear most for my nation is misguiding leaders. Some tribes among my nation will worship idols and some tribes among my nation will join the idolaters. Before the Hour comes there will be nearly thirty Dajjals (great liars), each of them claiming to be a Prophet. But a group among my nation will continue to adhere to the truth and be victorious, and those who oppose them will not harm them, until the command of Allah comes to pass.’”
3953 | It was narrated that Zainab bint Jahsh said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) woke up red in the face and said: ‘La ilaha illallah, woe to the Arabs from an evil that has drawn nigh. Today a hole has been opened in the barrier of Gog and Magog.’ And he gestured to indicate the size of the hole.” Zainab said: “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Will we be destroyed when there are righteous people among us?’ He said: ‘If sin and evil deeds increase.’”

For there is a closed door between you and them.” ‘Umar said: “Will that door be broken or opened?” I said: “No, it will be broken.” ‘Umar said: “Then it will never be closed.’” We asked Hudhaifah: “Did ‘Umar know what that door meant?” He said: "Yes, just as he knows that there will be night before morning, because I narrated to him a Hadith in which there are no errors.” We were afraid to ask him who the door was, so we said to Masruq: “Ask him." He said: “‘Umar.”
3956 | It was narrated that ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Abd Rabbil-Ka’bah said:“I came to ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin ‘As when he was sitting in the shade of the Ka’bah, and the people were gathered around him, and I heard him say: ‘While we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey, he stopped to camp and some of us were pitching tents, some were competing in shooting arrows and some were taking the animals out to graze them. Then his caller called out: “As-Salatu Jami’ah (prayer is about to begin).” So we gathered, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and addressed us. He said: “There has never been a Prophet before me who was not obliged to tell his nation of what he knew was good for them, and to warn against what he knew was bad for them. With regard to this nation of yours, soundness (of religious commitment) and well-being has been placed in its earlier generations and the last of them will be afflicted with calamities and things that you dislike. Then there will come tribulations which will make the earlier ones pale into significance, and the believer will say: ‘This will be the end of me,’ then relief will come. Then (more) tribulations will come and the believer will say: ‘This will be the end of me,’ then relief will come. Whoever would like to be taken far away from Hell and admitted to Paradise, let him die believing in Allah and the Last Day, and let him treat people as he would like to be treated. Whoever gives his oath of allegiance to a ruler and gives a sincere promise, let him obey him as much as he can, and if another comes and challenges him, let them strike the neck (i.e., kill) the second one.’” He the narrator said: “I raised my head among the people and said: 'I adjure you by Allah, did you hear that from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?' He ('Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As) pointed with his hand to his ears and said: I heard it directly from him and memorized it.'”
3957 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“How will you be at a time that will soon come, when the good people will pass away and only the worst ones will be left, who will break their promises and betray their trusts, and they will differ while they were previously together like this,” – and he interlaced his fingers. They said: “What should we do, O Messenger of Allah, when that comes to pass?” He said: “Follow that which you know is true, and leave that which you dislike. Take care of your own affairs and turn away from the common folk.”
3958 | It was narrated from Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“What will you do, O Abu Dharr, when death overwhelms the people to such an extent that a grave will be equal in value to a slave?” I said: “Whatever Allah and His Messenger choose for me, or Allah and His Messenger know best.” He said “Be patient.” He said: ‘What will you do when famine strikes the people so that you will go to the place where you pray and will not be able to return to your bed, or you will not be able to get up from your bed to go to the place where you pray?” He said: “I said: ‘Allah and His Messenger know best, or whatever Allah and His Messenger choose for me.” He said: “You must refrain from forbidden things.” He said: “What will you do when killing befalls the people so that Hijaratuz-Zait*is covered with blood?” I said: “Whatever Allah and His Messenger choose for me.” He said: “Stay with those whom you belong to.” He said: “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, should I not take my sword and strike those who do that?’” He said: “Then you will be just like the people. Rather enter your house.” I said: “O Messenger of Allah, what if they enter my house?” He said: “If you are afraid that the flashing of the sword will dazzle you, then put the edge of your garment over your face, and let him carry his own sin and your sin, and he will be one of the people of the Hellfire.”
3959 | Abu Musa narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Before the Hour comes there will be Harj.” I said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is Harj?” He said: “Killing.” Some of the Muslims said: “O Messenger of Allah, now we kill such and such a number of idolaters in one year.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “That will not be like killing the idolaters, rather you will kill one another, until a man will kill his neighbor and son of the cousin and a relative.” Some of the people said: “O Messenger of Allah, will we be in our right minds that day?” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “No, reason will be taken away from most of the people at that time, and there will be left the insignificant people who have no reason.”
3960 | ‘Udaisah bint Uhban said:“When ‘Ali bin Abu Talib came to Basrah, he entered upon my father and said: ‘O Abu Muslim, will you not help me against these people?’ He said: ‘Of course.’ So he called a slave woman of his and said: ‘O slave woman, bring me my sword.’ So she brought it, and he unsheathed it a span, and (I saw that) it was made of wood. He said: ‘My close friend and your cousin (ﷺ) advised me, if tribulation (Fitnah) arose among the Muslims, that I should take a sword of wood. If you wish I will go out with you.’ He said: ‘I have no need of you or of your sword.’”
3961 | It was narrated from Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Before the Hour comes, there will be tribulation like pieces of black night, when a man will wake up as a believer but be a disbeliever by evening, or he will be a believer in the evening but will be a disbeliever by morning. And the one who is sitting will be better than the one who is standing, and the one who is standing will be better than the one who is walking, and the one who is walking will be better than the one who is running. So break your bows, cut their strings and strike your swords against rocks, and if anyone enters upon anyone of you, let him be like the better of the two sons of Adam. (i.e. the one killed, not the killer).”
3962 | It was narrated that Abu Burdah said:“I entered upon Muhammad bin Maslamah and he said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘There will be tribulation, division and dissension. When that comes, take your sword to Uhud and strike it until it breaks, then sit in your house until there comes to you the hand of the evildoer (to kill you) or a predestined (natural) death.’” "And that came to pass, and I did as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said."
3963 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“There are no two Muslims who confront one another with their swords, but both the killer and the slain will be in Hell.”
3964 | It was narrated from Abu Musa that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When two Muslims confront one another with their swords, both the killer and the slain will be in Hell.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, (we understand about) this killer, but what is wrong with the one who is slain?” He said: “He wanted to kill his companion.’”
3965 | It was narrated from Abu Bakrah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“When one Muslim wields his weapon against his brother, both of them are at the edge of Hell, and if one of them kills the other, they will both enter it.”

3967 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There will be a tribulation which will utterly destroy the Arabs, and those who are slain will be in Hell. At that time the tongue will be worse than a blow of the sword.”
3968 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Beware of tribulations, for at that time the tongue will be like the blow of a sword.”
3969 | It was narrated that ‘Alqamah bin Waqqas said that a man passed by him, who held a prominent position, and ‘Alqamah said to him:“You have kinship and rights, and I see you entering upon these rulers and speaking to them as Allah wills you should speak. But i heard Bilal bin Harith Al-Muzani, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), say that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘One of you may speak a word that pleases Allah, and not know how far it reaches, but Allah will record for him as pleasure, until the Day of Resurrection due to that word. And one of you may speak a word that angers Allah, and not know how far it reaches, but Allah will record against him his anger, until the Day he meets Him due to that word.” 'Alqamah said: "So look, woe to you, at what you say and what you speak about, for there is something that I wanted to say but I refrained because of what I heard from Bilal bin Harith."
3970 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“A man may speak a word that angers Allah and not see anything wrong with it, but it will cause him to sink down in Hell the depth of seventy autumns.”
3971 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him say something good, or else remain silent.”
3972 | Sufyan bin ‘Abdullah Thaqafi said:“I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, tell me of something that I can adhere to.’ He said: ‘Say: “Allah is my Lord,” then stand straight (adhere steadfastly to Islam).’ He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what is the thing that you fear most for me?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took hold of his own tongue, then he said: ‘This.’”
3973 | It was narrated that Mu’adh bin Jabal said:“I was with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey. One morning I drew close to him when we were on the move and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, tell me of an action that will gain me admittance to Paradise and keep me far away from Hell.’ He said: ‘You have asked for something great, but it is easy for the one for whom Allah makes it easy. Worship Allah and do not associate anything in worship with Him, establish prayer, pay charity, fast Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the House.’ Then he said: ‘Shall I not tell you of the means of goodness? Fasting is a shield, and charity extinguishes sin as water extinguishes fire, and a man’s prayer in the middle of the night.’ Then he recited: “Their sides forsake their beds” until he reached: “As a reward for what they used to do.”[32:16-17] Then he said: ‘Shall I not tell you of the head of the matter, and its pillar and pinnacle? (It is) Jihad.’ Then he said: ‘Shall I not tell you of the basis of all that?’ I said: ‘Yes.’ He took hold of his tongue then said: ‘Restrain this.’ I said: ‘O Prophet of Allah, will we be brought to account for what we say?’ He said: ‘May your mother not found you, O Mu’adh! Are people thrown onto their faces in Hell for anything other than the harvest of their tongues?’”
3974 | It was narrated from Umm Habibah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The words of the son of Adam count against him, not for him, except what is good and forbidding what is evil, and remembering Allah.”
3975 | It was narrated that Abu Sha’tha said:“It was said to Ibn ‘Umar: ‘We enter upon our rulers and say one thing, and when we leave we say something else.’ He said: ‘At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we used to regard that as hypocrisy.’”

3977 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The best lifestyle is that of a man who holds onto the reins of his horse for the sake of Allah, riding on its back. Every time he hears a commotion he rushes towards it, seeking death wherever he thinks he can find it; and a man who tends sheep at the top of one of these peaks, or in the bottom of one of these valleys, establishing the prayer, paying the charity, and worshipping his Lord until the inevitable (death) comes to him and there is nothing between him and the people except good.”
3978 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said:“Which of the people is best?” He said: “A man who strives in Jihad in the cause of Allah with himself and his wealth.” He said: “Then who?” He said: “A man in a mountain pass who worships Allah and leaves the people from his evil.”
3979 | It was narrated from Hudhaifah bin Yaman that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There will be callers at the gates of Hell; whoever responds to them they throw them into it.” I said: “O Messenger of Allah, describe them to us.” He said: “They will be from our people, speaking our language.” I said: “What do you command me to do, if I live to see that?” He said: “Adhere tothe main body of the Muslims and their leader. If there is no such body and no leader, then withdraw from all their groups, even if you bite onto the trunk of a tree until death finds you in that state.”
3980 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Soon the best wealth of a Muslim will be sheep which he follows in the mountain peaks and places where rainfall is to be found, fleeing for the sake of his religion from tribulations.”
3981 | It was narrated from Hudhaifah bin Yaman that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There will be tribulations at the gates of which will be callers (calling people) to Hell. Dying when you are biting onto the stump of a tree will be better for you than following anyone of them.”
3982 | Abu Hurairah said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The believer should not be stung from the same hole twice.”
3983 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘The believer should not be stung from the same hole twice.’”
3984 | While on the pulpit, pointing with this fingers towards his ears, Nu’man bin Bashir said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain, and between them are matters that are not clear, about which not many people know. Thus he who guards against the unclear matters, he clears himself with regard to his religion and his honor. But he who falls into the unclear matters, he falls into that which is unlawful. Like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Every king has a sanctuary. And beware! Allah’s sanctuary is His prohibitions. Beware! In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the whole body will be sound, and if it is corrupt, the whole body will be corrupt. It is the heart.’”

3989 | It was narrated from ‘Umar bin Khattab that he went out one day to the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he found Mu’adh bin Jabal sitting by the grave of the Prophet (ﷺ), weeping. He said:“Why are you weeping?” He said: “I am weeping because of something that I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘A little showing off is polytheism and whoever shows enmity towards a friend of Allah has declared war on Allah. Allah loves those who se righteousness and piety are hidden, those who, if they are absent, are not missed, and if they are present, they are not invited or acknowledged. Their hearts are lamps of guidance and they get out of every trial and difficulty.’”
3990 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“People are like a hundred camels; you can hardly find one worth riding among them.”
3991 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The Jews split into seventy-one sects and my nation will split into seventy-three sects.”
3992 | It was narrated from ‘Awf bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said:“The Jews split into seventy-one sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy in Hell. The Christians split into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which will be in Hell and one in Paradise. I swear by the One Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, my nation will split into seventy-three sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy-two in Hell.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, who are they?” He said: “The main body.”
3993 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘The Children of Israel split into seventy-one sects, and my nation will split into seventy-two, all of which will be in Hell apart from one, which is the main body.”

3995 | Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and addressed the people saying: ‘No, by Allah, I do not fear for you, O people, but I fear the attractions of this world that Allah brings forth for you.’ A man said to him: ‘O Messenger of Allah(ﷺ), does good bring forth evil?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent for a while, then he said: ‘What did you say?’ He said: ‘I said, does good bring forth evil?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Good does not bring forth anything but good, but is it really good? Everything that grows on the banks of a stream may either kill if overeaten or (at least) make the animals sick, except if an animal eats its fill of Khadir* and then faces the sun, and then defecates  and urinates, chews the cud and then returns to graze again. Whoever takes wealth in a lawful manner, it will be blessed for him, but whoever takes it in an unlawful manner, his likeness is that of one who eats and it never satisfied.’”
3996 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin ‘As that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When the treasures of Persia and Rome are opened for you, what kind of people will you be?” ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf said: “We will say what Allah has commanded us to say.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Or something other than that. You will compete with one another, then you will envy one another, then you will turn your backs on one another, then you will hate one another, or something like that. Then you will go to the poor among the Muhajirun and appoint some of them as leaders of others.”
3997 | It was narrated from ‘Amr bin ‘Awf, who was an ally of Banu ‘Amir bin Lu’ai and was present at (the battle of) Badr with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent ‘Ubaidah bin Jarrah to Bahrain to collect the Jizyah, and the Prophet (ﷺ) had made a treaty with the people of Bahrain, and he appointed as their governor ‘Ala’ bin Hadrami. Abu ‘Ubaidan came with the wealth from Bahrain and the Ansar heard that Abu ‘Ubaidah had come, so they attended the Fajr prayer with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had prayed, he went away, so they intercepted him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled  when he saw them, then he said:‘I think you have heard that Abu ‘Ubaidah has brought something from Bahrain?’ They said: ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘Be of good cheer and hope for that which will make you happy. By Allah, I do not fear poverty for you, rather I fear that you will enjoy ease and plenty like those who came before you, and that you will compete with one another as they did, and you will be destroyed as they were.’”
3998 | It was narrated from Usamah bin Zaid that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“I am not leaving behind me any tribulation that is more harmful to men than women.”
3999 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“No morning comes but two angels call out: ‘Woe to men from women, and woe to women from men.’”
4000 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up to deliver a sermon and one of the things that he said was:“This world is fresh and sweet, and Allah will make your successive generations therein, so look at what you do and beware of (the temptations of) this world and beware of (the temptations of) women.”
4001 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“While the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting in the mosque, a woman from Muzainah (tribe) entered, trailing her garment in the mosque. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘O people, tell your women not to wear their adornments and show pride in the mosque, for the Children of Israel were not cursed until their women wore adornments and walked proudly in their places of worship.’”
4002 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah met a woman who was wearing perfume and heading for the mosque. He said:“O slavewoman of the Compeller, where are you headed?” She said: “To the mosque.” He said: “And have you put on perfume for that?” She said: “Yes.” He said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Any woman who puts on perfume then goes out to the mosque, no prayer will be accepted from her until she takes a bath.’”
4003 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“O women, give in charity and pray a great deal for forgiveness, for I have seen that you form the majority of the people of Hell.” A woman who was very wise said: “Why is it, O Messenger of Allah, that we form the majority of the people of Hell?” He said: “You curse a great deal and you are ungrateful to your husbands, and I have never seen anyone lacking in discernment and religion more overwhelming to a man of wisdom than you.” She said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is this lacking in discernment and religion?” He said: “The lack of discernment is the fact that the testimony of two women is equal to the testimony of one man; this is the lack of reason. And (a woman) spends several nights when she does not pray, and she does not fast in Ramadhan, and this is the lack in religion.”
4004 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, before you call and you are not answered.’”
4005 | It was narrated that Qais bin Abu Hazim said:“Abu Bakr stood up and praised and glorified Allah, then he said: ‘O people, you recite this Verse – “O you who believe! Take care of your own selves. If you follow the (right) guidance no hurt can come to you from those who are in error.”[5:105] – but I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘If people see some evil but do not change it, soon Allah will send His punishment upon them all.’” (One of the narrators) Abu Usamah repeated: "Indeed I heard that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say."
4006 | It was narrated from Abu ‘Ubaidah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When the Children of Isral became deficient in religious commitment, a man would see his brother committing sin and would tell him not to do it, but the next day, what he had seen him do did not prevent him from eating or drinking with him, or mixing with him. So Allah made the hearts of those who did not commit sin like the hearts of those who did, and He revealed Qur’an concerning them and said: “Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of David and ‘Eisa, son of Maryam” until he reached: “And had they believed in Allah, and in the Prophet and in what has been revealed to him, never would they have taken them (the disbelievers) as their friends; but many of them are disobedient (to Allah).”[5:78-81] The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat up and said: "No, not until they take the hand of the wrongdoer (i.e. restrain him] and force him to follow the right way."
4007 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up to deliver a sermon, and one of the things he said was:“Indeed, fear of people should not prevent a man from speaking the truth, if he knows it.” Then Abu Sa'eed wept and said: "By Allah, we have seen things that made us scared (and we did not speak up)."
4008 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“No one of you should belittle himself.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, how could anyone of us belittle himself?” He said: “If he sees something concerning which he should speak out for the sake of Allah but does not say anything. Allah will say to him on the Day of Resurrection: “What prevented you from speaking concerning such and such?” He will say: “Fear of the people.” (Allah) will say: “Rather you should have feared Me.”
4009 | It was narrated from ‘Ubaidullah bin Jarir that his father said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘There is no people among whom sins are committed when they are stronger and of a higher status (i.e. they have the power and ability to stop the sinners) and they do not change them, but Allah will send His punishment upon them all.’”
4010 | It was narrated that Jabir said:“When the emigrants who had crossed the sea came back to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he said: ‘Why don’t you tell me of the strange things that you saw in the land of Abyssinia?’ Some young men among them said: ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allah. While we were sitting, one of their elderly nuns came past, carrying a vessel of water on her head. She passed by some of their youth, one of whom placed his hand between her shoulders and pushed her. She fell on her knees and her vessel broke. When she stood up, she turned to him and said: “You will come to know, O traitor, that when Allah sets up the Footstool and gathers the first and the last, and hands and feet speak of what they used to earn, you will come to know your case and my case in His presence soon.’” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘She spoke the truth, she spoke the truth. How can Allah purify any people (of sin) when they do not support their weak from their strong?’”
4011 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The best of jihad is a just word spoken to an unjust ruler.”
4012 | It was narrated that Abu Umamah said:“A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the first pillar and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, which Jihad is best?’ but he kept quiet. When he saw the second Pillar, he asked again, and he kept quiet. When he stoned ‘Aqabah Pillar, he placed his foot in the stirrup, to ride, and said: ‘Where is the one who was asking?’ (The man) said: ‘Here I am, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘A word of truth spoken to an unjust ruler.’”
4013 | It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri said:“Marwan brought out the pulpit on the day of ‘Eid, and he started with the sermon before the prayer. A man said: ‘O Marwan, you have gone against the Sunnah. You have brought out the pulpit on this day, and it was not brought out before, and you have started with the sermon before the prayer, and this was not done before.’ Abu Sa’eed said: ‘As for this man, he has done his duty. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Whoever among you sees an evil action and can change it with his hand (by taking action), let him change it with his hand. If he cannot do that, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot do that, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling that it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.’”
4014 | It was narrated that Abu Umayyah Sha’bani said:“I came to Abu Tha’labah Al-Khushani and said: ‘How do you understand this Verse?’ He said: ‘Which verse?’ I said: “O you who believe! Take care of your own selves. If you follow the (right) guidance, no hurt can come to you from those who are in error.”?[5:105] He said: ‘You have asked one who knows about it. I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it and he said: “Enjoin good upon one another and forbid one another to do evil, but if you see overwhelming stinginess, desires being followed, this world being preferred (to the Hereafter), every person with an opinion feeling proud of it, and you realize that you have no power to deal with it, then you have to mind your own business and leave the common folk to their own devices. After you will come days of patience, during which patience will be like grasping a burning ember, and one who does good deeds will have a reward like that of fifty men doing the same deed.”
4015 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:“It was said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, when should we stop enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil?’ He said: ‘When there appears among you that which appeared among those who came before you.’ We said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what appeared among those that came before us?’ He said: ‘Kingship given to your youth, immorality even among the old, and knowledge among the base and vile.’”
4016 | It was narrated from Hudhaifah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The believer should not humiliate himself.” They said: “How could he humiliate himself?” He said: “By taking on a trial that he cannot deal with.”
4017 | Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Allah will question His slave on the Day of Resurrection, until He says: “What kept you from denouncing evil when you saw it?” When Allah grants His slave a response, he will say: “O Lord, I hoped for Your mercy but I feared the people.”
4018 | It was narrated from Abu Musa that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘Allah gives respite to the wrongdoer, then when He seizes him, He does not let him go.” Then he recited: “Such is the Seizure of your Lord when He seizes the (population of) towns while they are doing wrong.”[11:102]
4019 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned to us and said: ‘O Muhajirun, there are five things with which you will be tested, and I seek refuge with Allah lest you live to see them: Immorality never appears among a people to such an extent that they commit it openly, but plagues and diseases that were never known among the predecessors will spread among them. They do not cheat in weights and measures but they will be stricken with famine, severe calamity and the oppression of their rulers. They do not withhold the Zakah of their wealth, but rain will be withheld from the sky, and were it not for the animals, no rain would fall on them. They do not break their covenant with Allah and His Messenger, but Allah will enable their enemies to overpower them and take some of what is in their hands. Unless their leaders rule according to the Book of Allah and seek all good from that which Allah has revealed, Allah will cause them to fight one another.’”
4020 | It was narrated from Abu Malik Ash’ari that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“People among my nation will drink wine, calling it by another name, and musical instruments will be played for them and singing girls (will sing for them). Allah will cause the earth to swallow them up, and will turn them into monkeys and pigs.”
4021 | It was narrated from Bara’ bin ‘Azib that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Allah will curse them and those who curse will curse them.” He said: “The inhabitants of the earth.”
4022 | It was narrated from Thawban that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Nothing increases one’s life span except righteousness and nothing repels the Divine decree except supplication, and a man may be deprived of provision by a sin that he commits.’”
4023 | It was narrated from Mus’ab bin Sa’d that his father, Sa’d bin Abu Waqqas, said:“I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, which people are most severely tested?’ He said: ‘The Prophets, then the next best and the next best. A person is tested according to his religious commitment. If he is steadfast in his religious commitment, he will be tested more severely, and if he is frail in his religious commitment, his test will be according to his commitment. Trials will continue to afflict a person until they leave him walking on the earth with no sin on him.’”
4024 | Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri said:“I entered upon the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was suffering from a fever, I placed my hand on him and felt heat with my hand from above the blanket. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, how hard it is for you!’ He said: ‘We (Prophets) are like that. The trial is multiplied for us and so is the reward.’ I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, which people are most severely tested?’ He said: ‘The Prophets.’ I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, then who?’ He said: ‘Then the righteous, some of whom were tested with poverty until they could not find anything except a cloak to put around themselves. One of them will rejoice at calamity as one of you would rejoice at ease.’”
4025 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah said:“It is as if I can see the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), telling us the story of one of the Prophets: ‘His people beat him, and he was wiping the blood from his face and saying: “O Lord forgive my people, for they do not know.’”
4026 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“We are more likely to express doubt than Ibrahim when he said: “My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.’ He (Allah) said: ‘Do you not believe?’ He (Ibrahim) said: ‘Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in Faith.’[2:260] And may Allah have mercy on Lut. He wished to have a powerful support. And if i were to stay in prison as long as Yusuf stayed, I would have accepted the offer.’”
4027 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:On the Day of Uhud, a molar of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was broken and he was wounded. Blood started pouring down his face, and he started to wipe his face and say: “How can any people prosper if they soak the face of their Prophet with blood when he is calling them to Allah?” Then Allah revealed: “Not for you is the decision.”[3:128]
4028 | It was narrated that Anas said:“One day, Jibril (as) came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he was sitting in a sorrowful state with his face soaked with blood, because some of the people of Makkah had struck him. He said: ‘What is the matter with you?’ He said: ‘These people did such and such to me.’ He said: ‘Would you like me to show you a sign?’ He said: ‘Yes, show me.’ He looked at a tree on the far side of the valley and said: ‘Call that tree.’ So he called it, and it came walking until it stood before him. He said: ‘Tell it to go back.’ So he told it, and it went back to its place. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘That is sufficient for me.’”
4029 | It was narrated from Hudhaifah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Count for me all those who have uttered (the word of) Islam.” We said: “O Messenger of Allah, do you fear for us when we number between six and seven hundred?” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “You do not know, perhaps you will be tested.”
4030 | It was narrated from Ubayy bin Ka’b that on the night when he (ﷺ) was taken on the Night Journey (Isra’), the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) noticed a good fragrance and said:“O Jibril, what is this good fragrance?” He said: “This is the fragrance of the grave of the hairdresser and her two sons and her husband.” He said: “That began when Khadir, who was one of the nobles of the Children of Israel, used to pass by a monk in his cell. The monk used to meet him and he taught him Islam. When Khadir reached adolescence, his father married him to a woman. He taught her and made her promise not to teach it to anyone. He used not to touch women, so he divorced her, then his father married him to another woman, and he taught her and made her promise not to teach it to anyone. One of them kept the secret but the other disclosed it, so he fled until he came to an island in the sea. Two men came, gathering firewood, and saw him. One of them kept the secret but the other disclosed it and said: ‘I have seen Khadir.’ It was said: ‘Who else saw him besides you?’ He said: ‘So-and-so.’ (The other man) was questioned but he kept silent. According to their religion, the liar was to be killed. The woman who had kept the secret got married, and while she was combing the hair of Pharoah’s daughter, she dropped the comb and said: ‘May Pharoah perish!’ (The daughter) told her father about that. The woman had two sons and a husband. (Pharoah) sent for them, and tried to make the woman and her husband give up their religion, but they refused. He said: ‘I am going to kill you.’ They said: ‘It would be an act of kindness on your part, if you kill us, to put us in one grave.’ So he did that.” When the Prophet (ﷺ) was taken on the Night Journey (Isra’), he noticed a good fragrance and asked Jibril about it and he told him.”
4031 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The greatest reward comes with the greatest trial. When Allah loves a people He tests them. Whoever accepts that wins His pleasure but whoever is discontent with that earns His wrath.”
4032 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The believer who mixes with people and bears their annoyance with patience will have a greater reward than the believer who does not mix with people and does not put up with their annoyance.”
4033 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There are three things, whoever has them has found the taste of faith (One of the narrators) Bundar said: ‘The sweetness of faith; When he loves a man and only loves him for the sake of Allah. When Allah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anything else; and when being thrown into the fire is dearer to him than going back to disbelief after Allah has saved him from it.”
4034 | It was narrated from Abu Darda’ that my close friend (ﷺ) advised me:“Do not associate anything with Allah, even if you are cut and burned. Do not neglect any prescribd prayer deliberately, for whoever neglects it deliberately no longer has the protection of Allah. And do not drink wine, for it is the key to all evil.”
4035 | Mu’awiyah said:“I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: ‘There is nothing left of this world except trials and tribulations.’”
4036 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There will come to the people years of treachery, when the liar will be regarded as honest, and the honest man will be regarded as a liar; the traitor will be regarded as faithful, and the faithful man will be regarded as a traitor; and the Ruwaibidah will decide matters.’ It was said: ‘Who are the Ruwaibidah?’ He said: ‘Vile and base men who control the affairs of the people.’”
4037 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, this world will not pass away until a man will pass by a grave, and will roll on it and say: ‘Would that I were in the place of the occupant of this grave!’ And the reason for that will not be any religious motive, rather it will be because of calamity.”
4038 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“You will be picked over just as (good) dates are selected (separated) from its bad ones. So the best of you will be taken and the worst of you will be left, so die if you can.”
4039 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Adhering to religion will only become harder and worldly affairs will only become more difficult, and people will only become more stingy, and the Hour will only come upon the worst of people, and the only Mahdi (after Muhammad (ﷺ)) is ‘Eisa bin Maryam.”
4040 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“I and the Hour have been sent like these two,” and he held up his two fingers together.
4041 | It was narrated that Hudhaifah bin Asid said:"The Prophet (ﷺ) looked out at us from a room, when we were talking about the Hour. He said: 'The Hour will not begin until there are ten signs: Dajjal, (False Christ), the smoke, and the rising of the sun from the west.'"
4042 | ‘Awf bin Malik Al-Ashja’i said:“I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the campaign of Tabuk, when he was in a tent made of leather, so I sat in front of the tent. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Enter, O ‘Awf.’ I said, ‘All of me, O Messenger of Allah?’ He said: ‘All of you.’ Then he said: ‘O ‘Awf, remember six things (that will occur) before the Hour comes, one of which is my death.’ I was very shocked and saddened at that. He said: ‘Count that as the first. Then (will come) the conquest of Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem); then a disease which will appear among you and cause you and your offspring to die as martyrs and will purify your deeds; then there will be (much) wealth among you, so that if a man were to be given one hundred Dinar he would still be dissatisfied; and there will be tribulation among you that will not leave any Muslim house untouched;* then there will be a treaty between you and the Romans, then they will betray you and march against you with eighty banners, under each of which will be twelve thousand (troops).’”
4043 | It was narrated from Hudhaifah bin Yaman that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The Hour will not begin until you kill your ruler and fight one another with swords, and your world is inherited by the worst of you.”
4044 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out one day to the people, and a man came to him and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, when will the Hour be?’ He said: ‘The one who is asked about it does not know more than the one who is asking. But I will tell you of its portents. When the slave woman gives birth to her mistress, that is one of its portents. When the barefoot and naked become leaders of the people, that is one of its portents. When shepherds compete in constructing buildings, that is one of its portents. (The Hour) is one of five (things) which no one knows except Allah.’ Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited the words: “Verily, Allah, with Him (alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. (to the end of the Verse).”[31:34]
4045 | It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:“Shall I not tell you a Hadith that I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), which no one will tell you after me? I heard it from him (saying): ‘Among the portents of the Hour are that knowledge will be taken away and ignorance will prevail, illegal sex will become widespread and wine will be drunk, and men will disappear and women will be left, until there is one man in charge of fifty women.”
4046 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The Hour will not begin until the Euphrates uncovers a mountain of gold and people fight over it, and out of every ten, nine will be killed.’”
4047 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The Hour will not begin until wealth becomes abundant and tribulations appear, and Harj increases.” They said: “What is Harj, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “Killing, killing, killing,” three times.
4048 | It was narrated that Ziyad bin Labid said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned something and said: ‘That will be at the time when knowledge (of Qur’an) disappears.’ I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, how will knowledge disappear when we read the Qur’an and teach it to our children, until the Day of Resurrection?’ He said: ‘May your mother be bereft of you, Ziyad! I thought that you were the wisest man in Al- Madinah. Is it not the case that these Jews and Christians read the Tawrah and the Injil, but they do not act upon anything of what is in them?’”
4049 | It was narrated from Hudhaifah bin Yaman that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Islam will wear out as embroidery on a garment wears out, until no one will know what fasting, prayer, (pilgrimage) rites and charity are. The Book of Allah will be taken away at night, and not one Verse of it will be left on earth. And there will be some people left, old men and old women, who will say: “We saw our fathers saying these words: ‘La ilaha illallah’ so we say them too.” Silah said to him: “What good will (saying): La ilaha illallah do them, when they do not know what fasting, prayer, (pilgrimage) rites and charity are?” Hudhaifah turned away from his. He repeated his question three times, and Hudhaifah turned away from him each time. Then he turned to him on the third time and said: “O Silah! It will save them from Hell,” three times.
4050 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Just before the Hour, there will be days when knowledge will disappear, ignorance will become widespread and there will be much Harj. And Harj means killing.”
4051 | It was narrated from Abu Musa that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“After you days will come when ignorance will become widespread, knowledge will disappear and there will be much Harj.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is Harj?” He said: “Killing.”
4052 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah in a Marfu’ report (meaning, attributed to the Prophet (ﷺ)):“Time will pass quickly, knowledge will decrease, miserliness will be cast into people’s hearts, tribulations will appear and there will be much Harj.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is Harj?” He said: “Killing.”
4053 | It was narrated that Hudhaifah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told us two Ahadith, one of which I have seen, and I am still waiting for the other. He told us: ‘Honesty was preserved in the roots of men’s hearts’ – (One of the narrators) Tanafisi said: ‘Meaning in the middle of men’s hearts’ – ‘Then the Qur’an was revealed and we learned (it) from the Qur’an and the Sunnah.’ Then he told us about its disappearance, saying; ‘A man will go to sleep and honesty will be taken away from his heart, and only its trace will remain, like spots without color. Then he will go to sleep again and the remainder of the honesty will also be taken away (from his heart) and leaving a trace like a blister, as when an ember touches your foot and raises a blister which has nothing inside.’” Then Hudhaifah picked up a handful of pebbles and rolled them on his leg. He said: “People will engage in business with one another, but there will hardly be any honest persons among them. Then it will be said that in such and such a tribe there is an honest man, and a man will be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength, but there will not be even a mustard seed of faith in his heart.” "There was a time when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his religion would prevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim ruler would prevent him from cheating. But today I cannot deal except with so-and-so and so-and-so."
4054 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“When Allah wants to destroy a person, He takes away modesty from him, you will only see him with the wrath of Allah upon him, and he will be hated by people. When you only see him with the wrath of Allah upon him, and hated by people, then honesty will be taken away from him, and when honesty is taken away from him, you will only see him as a traitor who is called such by others. When you only see him as a traitor who is called such by others, then mercy will be taken away from him, and when mercy is taken away from him, you will only see him as rejected and accursed, and when you only see him as rejected and accursed, then the bond of Islam will be taken away from him.”
4055 | It was narrated that Hudhaifah bin Asid, Abu Sarihah, said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) looked out from a room, when we were talking about the Hour. He said: 'The Hour will not begin until ten signs appear: The rising of the sun from the west (place of its setting); Dajjal; the smoke; the beast; Gog and Magog people; the appearance of 'Eisa bin Maryam(as), the earth collapsing three times - once in the east, one in the west and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and fire that will emerge from the plain of Aden Abyan and will drive the people to the place of Gathering, stopping with them when they stop at night and when they stop to rest at midday."
4056 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Hasten to do good deeds (before) six things (happen): The rising of the sun from the west (place of its setting), the smoke, the beast of the earth, Dajjal (False Christ), that which will happen to each of you (death); and that which will happen to all people (the Day of Resurrection)."
4057 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that Abu Qatadah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “The (lesser) signs (will come) after two hundred (years).’”
4058 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“My nation will pass through five stages. For forty years (they will be) people of righteousness and piety. Then those who follow them, for the next one hundred and twenty years, will be people who show mercy to one another and uphold ties with one another. Then those who follow them for the next one hundred and sixty years will be people who will turn their backs on one another and sever ties with one another. Then there will be Harj after Harj (killing). Seek deliverance, seek deliverance.”
4059 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Just before the Hour comes there will be transformations, the earth collapsing, and Qadhf. (i.e. the throwing of stones perhaps as a means of punishment – maybe it refers to landslides).”
4060 | It was narrated from Sahl bin Sa’d that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“At the end of my nation there will be the earth collapsing, transformations, and Qadhf.”
4061 | It was narrated from Nafi’ that a man came to Ibn ‘Umar and said:“So-and-so sends his Salam to you.” He said: “I have heard that he has introduced innovations (into Islam). If he has indeed introduced innovations, then do not convey my Salam to him, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘There will be among my nation – or among this nation – transformations, the earth collapsing, and Qadhf.’ That was concerning Ahlul-Qadar.”
4062 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There will be among my nation collapsing of the earth, transformations, and Qadhf.”
4063 | Hafsah narrated that she heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say:“An invading army will come towards this House until, when they are in Bayda’, the middle of them will be swallowed up by the earth, and the first of them will call out to the last of them, and they will be swallowed up, until there is no one left of them except a fugitive who will tell them of what happened to them.” When the army of Hajjaj came, we thought that they were (the ones mentioned in this Hadith). A man said: “I bear witness that you did not attribute a lie to Hafsah and that Hafsah did not attribute a lie to the Prophet (ﷺ).”
4064 | It was narrated from Safiyyah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“People will not stop attacking this House until an army attacks, until when they are in Baida’, the first and the last of them will be swallowed by the earth, and the middle of them will not be saved.’” I said: “What if there are those among them who were forced (to join the army)?” He said: “Allah will resurrect them according to what is in the hearts.”
4065 | It was narrated that Umm Salamah said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned the army that would be swallowed up by the earth, and Umm Salamah said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, perhaps there will be some among them who were forced (to join them)?’ He said: ‘They will be resurrected according to their intentions.’”
4066 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The Beast will emerge and will have with it the seal of Sulaiman bin Dawud and the staff of Musa bin ‘Imran (as). It will make the faces of the believers shine with the staff, and will mark the noses of the disbelievers with the seal, until the inhabitants of a cluster of houses will gather together; then one will say ‘O believer!’ And to another ‘O disbeliever.’”
4067 | ‘Abdullah bin Buraidah narrated that his father said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took me to a place in the desert, near Makkah, where there was arid land surrounded by sand. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘The Beast will emerge from this spot – span by a span. (i.e, the size of that spot).’”
4068 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘The Hour will not begin until the sun rises from the west (i.e. the place of its setting). When it rises, the people will see it, and everyone on (earth) will believe, but that will be at a time when faith will not benefit anyone who did not believe before.’”
4069 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The first signs to appear will be at the rising of the sun from the west and the emergence of the Beast to the people, at forenoon.’” 'Abdullah said: "Whichever of them appears first, the other will come soon after." 'Abdullah said: "I do not think it will be anything other than the sun rising from the west."
4070 | It was narrated from Safwan bin ‘Assal that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Towards the west (i.e., the place of the setting of the sun) there is an open door, seventy years wide. That door will remain open for repentance until the sun rises from this direction. When it rises from this direction, faith will not benefit any soul that did not believe before or earn anything good through its faith.”
4071 | It was narrated that Hudhaifah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The Dajjal (False Christ) is blind in his left eye and has abundant hair. With him will be a Paradise and a Hell, but his Hell is Paradise and his Paradise is Hell.'"
4072 | It was narrated that Abu Bakr Siddiq said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told us: 'Dajjal will emerge in a land in the east called Khorasan, and will be followed by people with faces like hammered shields.'"
4073 | It was narrated that Mughirah bin Shu'bah said:"No one asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about Dajjal more than I did." (One of the narrators) Ibn Numair said (in his version): "(No one asked) more difficult questions than I did." - "He said to me: 'What are you asking about him?' I said: 'They say he will have food and drink with him.' He said: 'He is too insignificant before Allah for that.'"
4074 | It was narrated that Fatimah bint Qais said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed one day, and ascended the pulpit, and he never used to ascend it, before that, except on Fridays. The people were alarmed by that, and some were standing and some were sitting. He gestured to them with his hand, telling them to sit. (Then he said:) 'By Allah, I am not standing here for something that will benefit you, an exhortation or warning. Rather Tamim Dari has come to me and told me something that prevented me from taking a rest because of the joy and delight (I felt), and I wanted to spread that joy among you. A cousin of Tamim Dari told me that the wind drove them to an island that they did not know, so they sat in the rowing boats of the ship and set out. There they saw something black, with long eyelashes. They said to it: "What are you?" It said: "I am Jassasah," They said: "Tell us." It said: "I will not tell you anything or ask you anything. Rather there is this monastery that you have looked at. Go to it, for there is a man there who is longing to hear your news and tell you news." So they went there and entered upon him, and they saw an old man firmly shackled, with a sorrowful appearance and complaining a great deal. He said to them: "Where have you come from?" They said: "From Sham." He said: "How are the Arabs faring?" They said: "We are from among the Arabs. What do you want to ask about?" He said: "What has this man done who has appeared among you?" They said: "(He has done) well. He made enemies of some people, but Allah supported him against them and now they have become one, with one God and one religion." He said: "What happened to the spring of Zughar?" They said: "It is good; we irrigate out crops from it and drink from it." He said: "What happened to the date-palms between 'Amman and Baisan?" They said: "They bear fruit every year." He said: "What happened to the Lake of Tiberias?" They said: "It overflows because of the abundance of water." He gave three deep sighs, then he said: "If I were to free myself from these chains, I would not leave any land without entering it on these two feet of mine, except for Taibah, for I have no way to enter it." The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'My joy is so great. This (Al-Madinah) is Taibah, and by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, there is no narrow or broad road in it, or any plain or mountain, but there is an angel (standing) over it with his sword unsheathed, until the Day of Resurrection.'"
4075 | Nawwas bin Sam'an Al-Kilabi said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned Dajjal, one morning, as something despised but also alarming, until we thought that he was in the stand of date-palm trees. When we came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the evening, he saw that (fear) in us, and said: 'What is the matter with you?' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, you mentioned Dajjal this morning, and you spoke of him as something despised but also alarming, until we thought that he was in the stand of date-palm trees.' He said: 'There are things that I fear more for you than the Dajjal. If he appears while I am among you, I will contend with him on your behalf, and if he appears when I am not among you, then each man must fend for himself, and Allah will take care of every Muslim on my behalf. He (Dajjal) will be a young man with curly hair and a protuberant eye; I liken him to 'Abdul-'Uzza bin Qatan. Whoever among you sees him, let him recite the first Verses of Surat Al-Kahf over him. He will emerge from Khallah, between Sham and Iraq, and will wreak havoc right and left. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, how long will he stay on earth?' He said: 'Forty days, one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the rest of his days like your days.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, on that day which is like a year, will the prayers of one day suffice us?' He said: 'Make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer).' We said: 'How fast will he move through the earth?' He said: 'Like a rain cloud driving by the wind.' He said: 'He will come to some people and call them, and they will respond and believe in him. Then he will command the sky to rain and it will rain, and he will command the earth to produce vegetation and it will do so, and their flocks will come back in the evening with their humps taller, their udders fuller and their flanks fatter than they have ever been. Then he will come to some (other) people and call them, and they will reject him, so he will turn away from them and they will suffer drought and be left with nothing. Then he will pass through the wasteland and will say: "Bring forth your treasures," then go away, and its treasures will follow him like a swarm of bees. Then he will call a man brimming with youth and will strike him with a sword and cut him in two. He will put the two pieces as far apart as the distance between an archer and his target. Then he will call him and he will come with his face shining, laughing. While they are like that, Allah will send 'Eisa bin Maryam, who will come down at the white minaret in the east of Damascus, wearing two Mahrud[garment dyed with Wars and then Saffron], resting his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, beads of perspiration will fall from it. Every disbeliever who smells the fragrance of his breath will die, and his breath will reach as far as his eye can see. Then he will set out and catch up with him (the Dajjal) at the gate of Ludd, and will kill him. Then the Prophet of Allah 'Eisa will come to some people whom Allah has protected, and he will wipe their faces and tell them of their status in Paradise. While they are like that, Allah will reveal to him: "O 'Eisa, I have brought forth some of My slaves whom no one will be able to kill, so take My slaves to Tur in safety." Then Gog and Magog will emerge and they will, as Allah describes, "swoop down from every mound."[21:96] The first of them will pass by lake Tiberias and drink from it, then the last of them will pass by it and will say: "There was water here once." The Prophet of Allah, 'Eisa and his companions will be besieged there until the head of an ox would be dearer to any one of them than one hundred Dinar are to any one of you today. Then, the Prophet of Allah, 'Eisa and his companions will supplicate Allah. Then Allah will send a worm in their necks and the next morning they will all die as one. The Prophet of Allah 'Eisa and his companions will come down and they will not find even the space of a hand span that is free of their stink, stench and blood. They will pray to Allah, and He will send birds with necks like the necks of Bactrian camels, which will pick them up and throw them wherever Allah wills. Then Allah will send rain which will not leave any house of clay or hair, and it will wash the earth until it leaves it like a mirror (or a smooth rock). Then it will be said to the earth: "Bring forth your fruits and bring back your blessing." On that day a group of people will eat from a (single) pomegranate and it will suffice them, and they will seek shelter beneath its skin. Allah will bless a milch- camel so that it will be sufficient for a large number of people, and a milch-cow will be sufficient for a whole tribe and a milch-ewe will be sufficient for a whole clan. While they are like that, Allah will send a pleasant wind which will seize them beneath their armpits and will take the soul of every Muslim, leaving the rest of the people fornicating like donkeys, and upon them will come the Hour.'"
4076 | It was narrated from Nawwas bin Sam'an that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"The Muslims will use the bows, arrows and shields of Gog and Magog as firewood, for seven years.'"
4077 | It was narrated that Abu Umamah Al-Bahili said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us, and most of his speech had to do with telling us about Dajjal. He warned about him, and among the things he said was: 'There will not be any tribulation on earth, since the time Allah created the offspring of Adam, that will be greater than the tribulation of Dajjal. Allah has not sent any Prophet but he warned his nation about Dajjal. I am the last of the Prophets, and you are the last of the nations. He will undoubtedly appear among you. If he appears while I am among you, I will contend with him on behalf of every Muslim, and if he appears while I am not among you, then each man must fend for himself and Allah will take care of every Muslim on my behalf. He will emerge from Al-Khallah, between Sham and Iraq, and will wreak havoc right and left. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast. I will describe him to you in a manner in which none of the Prophets has described him before me. He will start by saying "I am a Prophet," and there is no Prophet after me. Then a second time he will say: "I am your Lord." But you will not see your Lord until you die. He is one-eyed, and your Lord is not one-eyed, and written between his eyes is Kafir. Every believer will read it, whether he is literate or illiterate. Part of his Fitnah will be that he will have with him Paradise and Hell, but his Hell will be a Paradise and his Paradise a Hell. Whoever is tested with his fire (hell), let him seek the help of Allah and recite the first Verses of Al-Kahf, then it will be cool and safe for him, as the fire was for Ibrahim. Part of his Fitnah will be that he will say to a Bedouin: "What do you think, if I resurrect your father and mother for you, will you bear witness that I am your Lord?" He will say: "Yes." Then two devils will appear to him in the form of his father and mother and will say: "O my son, follow him, for he is your Lord." And part of his Fitnah will be that he will overpower a single soul and kill him, then he will cut him with a saw until he falls in two pieces. Then he will say: "Look at this slave of mine; I will resurrect him now, then he will claim that he has a Lord other than me." Then Allah will resurrect him and the evil one will say to him: "Who is your Lord?" and he will say: "Allah is my Lord, and you are the enemy of Allah, you are Dajjal. By Allah, I have never had more insight about you than I have today."  (An addition) Abul-Hasan Tanafisi said: "Muharibi told us: 'Ubaidullah bin al-Walid Al-Wassafi told us, from 'Atiyyah, that Abu Sa'eed said: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'That man will be the highest in status in my nation in Paradise'" -  He said: "Abu Sa'eed said: 'By Allah, we did not think that man would be anyone other than 'Umar bin Khattab, until he passed away. -   Muharibi said: "Then we went back to the narration of Abu Rafi'." He said: - 'Part of his Fitnah will be that he will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth vegetation and it will do so. And part of his Fitnah will be that he will pass by a clan and they will disbelieve in him, so all their flocks will perish and none will be left. And part of his Fitnah will be that he will pass by a clan who will believe in him, so he will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth vegetation and it will do so, until their flocks will come back in the evening of that day, bigger and fatter than they have ever been, with their flanks stretched and their udders full of milk. There will be no part of the earth left that he does not enter and prevail over, except for Makkah and Al-Madinah, for he will not approach them on any of their mountain paths but he will be met by angels with unsheathed swords, until he will stop at the red hill at the end of the marsh. Then Al-Madinah will be shaken with its people three times, and no hypocrite, male or female, will be left, all will come out to him. Thus it will be cleansed of impurity just as the bellows cleanses the iron of dross. And that day will be called the Day of Deliverance.' "Umm Sharik bint Abi 'akar said: 'O Messenger of Allah, where will the Arabs be that day?' He said: 'On that day they will be few, and most of them will be in Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem), and their leader will be a righteous man. When their leader has stepped forward to lead them in subh prayer, 'Eisa bin Maryam will come down to them. Their leader will step backwards so that 'Eisa can come forward and lead the people in prayer, but 'Eisa will place his hand between his shoulders and say to him: "Go forward and pray, for the Iqamah was given for you." Then their leader will lead them in prayer. When he has finished, 'Eisa (as), will say: "Open the gate." So they will open it and behind it will be Dajjal with seventy thousand Jews, each of them carrying an adorned sword and wearing a greenish cloak. When Dajjal looks at him, he will start to melt as salt melts in water. He will run away, and 'Eisa (as), will say: "I have only one blow for you, which you will not be able to escape!" He will catch up with him at the eastern gate of Ludd, and will kill him. Then Allah will defeat the Jews, and there will be nothing left that Allah has created which the Jews will be able to hide behind, except that Allah will cause it to speak - no stone, no tree, no wall, no animal - except for Al-Gharqad (the box-thorn), for it is one of their trees, and will not speak - except that it will say: "O Muslim slave of Allah, here is a Jews, come and kill him!" "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'His (Dajjal's) days will number forty years: a year like half a year, a year like a month, a month like a week, and the rest of his days will be like sparks from a fire (i.e., they will pass quickly). One of you will enter the gate of Al-Madinah in the morning and not reach its other gate until evening comes.' It was said: 'O Messenger of Allah, how should we pray on those short days?' He said: 'Estimate (the times of) the prayer, as you do on these long days, then pray.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Eisa bin Maryam (as), will be a just judge and a just ruler among my nation. He will break the cross, slaughter the pigs, abolish the Jizyah and charity will be left. No one will be appointed to (collect the Zakah of) sheep and camels. Grudges and mutual hatred will disappear and the venom of every venomous creature will be removed, so that a baby boy will but his hand in a snake and it will not harm him, and a baby girl will make a lion run away, and it will not harm her; and the wolf will be among the sheep like their sheepdog. The earth will be filled with peace just as a vessel is filled with water. The people will be united and none will be worshipped except Allah. War will cease and Quraish will no longer be in power. The earth will be like a silver platter, with its vegetation growing as it did at the time of Adam, until a group of people will gather around one bunch of grapes and it will suffice them, and a group will gather around a single pomegranate and it will suffice them. An ox will be sold for such and such amount of money, and a horse will be sold for a few Dirham.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, why will horses be so cheap?' He said: 'They will never be ridden in war again.' It was said to him: 'Why will oxen be so expensive?' He said: 'Because all the land will be tilled. Before Dajjal appears there will be three difficult years in which the people will suffer severe famine. In the first year, Allah will command the sky to withhold one third of its rain and the earth to withhold one third of its produce. In the second year, He will command the sky to withhold two thirds of its rain and the earth to withhold two-thirds of its produce. In the third year, he will command the sky to withhold all of its rain, and not a single drop will fall, and the earth to withhold all of its produce, and nothing will grow. All cloven-hoofed animals will die, except those that Allah wills.' It was said: 'What will the people live on at that time?' He said: 'Tahlil, Takbir, Tasbih and Tahmid. That will take the place of food for them.'" Abu 'Abdullah (Ibn Majah) said: "I heard Abul-Hasan Tanafisi say: 'I heard 'Abdur-Rahman Al-Muharibi say: "This Hadith should be sent to every teacher so that they can teach it to the children in the schools."
4078 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"The Hour will not begin until 'Eisa bin Maryam comes down as a just judge and a just ruler. He will break the cross, kill the pigs and abolish the Jizyah, and wealth will become so abundant that no one will accept it."
4079 | It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Gog and Magog people will be set free and they will emerge as Allah says: "swoop(ing) down from every mound."[21:96] They will spread throughout the earth, and the Muslims will flee from them until the remainder of the Muslims are in their cities and fortresses, taking their flocks with them. They will pass by a river and drink from it, until they leave nothing behind, and the last of them will follow in their footsteps and one of them will say: 'There was once water in this place.' They will prevail over the earth, then their leader will say: 'These are the people of the earth, and we have finished them off. Now let us fight the people of heaven!' Then one of them will throw his spear towards the sky, and it will come back down smeared with blood. And they will say: 'We have killed the people of heaven.' While they are like that, Allah will send a worm like the worm that is found in the noses of sheep, which will penetrate their necks and they will die like locusts, one on top of another. In the morning the Muslims will not hear any sound from them, and they will say: 'Who will sell his soul for the sake of Allah and see what they are doing?' A man will go down, having prepared himself to be killed by them, and he will find them dead, so he will call out to them: 'Be of good cheer, for your enemy is dead!' Then the people will come out and let their flocks loose, but they will not have anything to graze on except their flesh, and they will become very fat as if they were grazing on the best vegetation they ever found.'"
4080 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Gog and Magog people dig every day until, when they can almost see the rays of the sun, the one in charge of them says: "Go back and we will dig it tomorrow." Then Allah puts it back, stronger than it was before. (This will continue) until, when their time has come, and Allah wants to send them against the people, they will dig until they can almost see the rays of the sun, then the one who is in charge of them will say: "Go back, and we will dig it tomorrow if Allah wills.' So they will say: "If Allah wills." Then they will come back to it and it will be as they left it. So they will dig and will come out to the people, and they will drink all the water. The people will fortify themselves against them in their fortresses. They will shoot their arrows towards the sky and they will come back with blood on them, and they will say: "We have defeated the people of earth and dominated the people of heaven." Then Allah will send a worm in the napes of their necks and will kill them thereby.'" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, the beasts of the earth will grow fat on their flesh."
4081 | It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said:"On the night on which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was taken on the Night Journey (Isra'), he met Ibrahim, Musa and 'Eisa, and they discussed the Hour. They started with Ibrahim, and asked him about it, but he did not have any knowledge of it. Then they asked Musa, and he did not have any knowledge of it. Then they asked 'Eisa bin Maryam, and he said: 'I have been assigned to some tasks before it happens.' As for as when it will take place, no one knows that except Allah. Then he mentioned Dajjal and said: 'I will descend and kill him, then the people will return to their own lands and will be confronted with Gog and Magog people, who will: "swoop down from every mound."[21:96] They will not pass by any water but they will drink it, (and they will not pass) by anything but they will spoil it. They (the people) will beseech Allah, and I will pray to Allah to kill them. The earth will be filled with their stench and (the people) will beseech Allah and I will pray to Allah, then the sky will send down rain that will carry them and throw them in the sea. Then the mountains will turn to dust and the earth will be stretched out like a hide. I have been promised that when that happens, the Hour will come upon the people, like a pregnant woman whose family does not know when she will suddenly give birth.'" (One of the narrators) 'Awwam said: "Confirmation of that is found in the Book of Allah, where Allah says: "Until, when Gog and Magog people are let loose (from their barrier), and they swoop down from every mound (21:96)."
4082 | It was narrated that 'Abdullah said:"While we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), some youngsters from Banu Hashim came along. When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw them, his eyes filled with tears and his color changed. I said: 'We still see something in your face that we do not like (to see).' He said: 'We are members of a Household for whom Allah has chosen the Hereafter over this world. The people of my Household will face calamity, expulsion and exile after I am gone, until some people will come from the east carrying black banners. They will ask for something good but will not be given it. Then they will fight and will be victorious, then they will be given what they wanted, but they will not accept it and will give leadership to a man from my family. Then they will fill it with justice just as it was filled with injustice. Whoever among you lives to see that, let him go to them even if he has to crawl over snow.'"
4083 | It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"The Mahdi will be among my nation. If he lives for a short period, it will be seven, and if he lives for a long period, it will be nine, during which my nation will enjoy a time of ease such as it has never enjoyed. The land will bring forth its yield and will not hold back anything, and wealth at that time will be piled up. A man will stand up and say: 'O Mahdi, give me!' He will say: 'Take.'"

Then you will come back until you stop in a meadow with many hillocks. A man from among the people of the Cross will raise the Cross and will say: ‘The Cross has prevailed.’ Then a man among the Muslims will become angry and will go and break the Cross.

They will conquer Constantinople with Tasbih and Takbir and will acquire such spoils of war as has never been seen before, which they will distribute by the shieldful.

Is there some pain bothering you, or is it because of this world, the best of which has already passed?’ He said: ‘It is not for any of these reasons. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave me some advice and I wish that I had followed it.

Are you not?’ Salman said: ‘I am only weeping for one reason: I am not weeping because of longing for this world or for dislike of the Hereafter. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave me some advice and I think that I have transgressed.’ He said: ‘What was his advice to you?’ He said: ‘He advised me that something like the provision of a rider is sufficient for anyone of you, and I think that I have transgressed that.

If he proposes marriage, his proposal deserves to be accepted; and if he intercedes, his intercession deserves to be accepted; and if he speaks, he deserves to be listened to.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent, and another man passed by. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘What do you think about this man?’ We said: ‘By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, this is one of the poor Muslims. If he proposes marriage, he does not deserve to get married; and if he intercedes, his intercession does not deserve to be accepted; and if he speaks, he does not deserve to be listened to.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘This one is better than an earthful of (men like) the other man.’”

4127 | It was narrated from Khabbab, concerning the Verse:“And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon...” up to His saying: “...and thus become of the unjust.” [6:52] He said: “Aqra’ bin Habis At-Tamimi and ‘Uyainah bin Hisn Al-Fazri came and found the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with Suhaib, Bilal, ‘Ammar and Khabbab, sitting with some of the believers who were weak (i.e., socially). When they saw them around the Prophet (ﷺ) they looked down on them. They took him aside and said: ‘We want you to sit with us along, so that the ‘Arabs will recognize our superiority. If the delegations of the Arabs come to you we will feel ashamed if the Arabs see us with these slaves. So, when we come to you, make them get up from your presence, then when we have finished, sit with them if you wish.’ He said: ‘Yes.’ They said: ‘Write a document for us (binding you to that).’ So he called for a piece of paper and he called ‘Ali to write, and we were sitting in a corner. Then Jibra’il (as), came down and said: “And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon seeking His Face. You are accountable for them in nothing, and they are accountable for you in nothing, that you may turn them away, and thus become of the unjust.” [6:52] Then he mentioned Aqra’ bin Habis and ‘Uyaynah bin Hisn, then he said: “Thus We have tried some of them with others, that they might say: ‘Is it these (poor believers) whom Allah has favored from amongst us?’ Does not Allah know best those who are grateful.” [6:53] Then he said: “When those who believe in Our Ayat come to you, say: Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be on you); your Lord has written (prescribed) mercy for Himself”.” [6:54] He said: “Then we got so close to him that our knees were touching his, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting with us. When he wanted to get up, he stood up and left us. Then Allah revealed: “And keep yourself patiently with those who call on their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His Face; and let not your eyes overlook them,” – and do not sit with the nobles – “desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance,” – meaning ‘Uyainah and Aqra’ – “and who follows his own lusts, and those affair (deeds) has been lost” [18:28] He said: ‘May they be doomed.’ He said: ‘May ‘Uyainah and Aqra’ be doomed.’ Then he made the parable for them of two men and the parable of this world. Khabbab said: “We used to sit with the Prophet (ﷺ) and if the time came for him to leave, we would get up and leave him, then he would leave.”
4128 | It was narrated that Sa’d said:“This Verse was revealed concerning us six: Myself, Ibn Mas’ud, Suhaib, ‘Ammar, Miqdad and Bilal. The Quraish said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): ‘We do not want to join them, send them away.’ Thoughts of that entered the heart of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as much as Allah willed, then Allah revealed: “And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon seeking His Face. You are accountable for them in nothing, and they are accountable for you in nothing, that you may turn them away, and thus become of the unjust.” [6:52]
4129 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Woe to the most wealthy except those who do such and such with the money, and such and such” – four things, (pointing) to his right, to his left, in front of him and behind him.

Whoever does not believe in me and does not know that what I have brought is the truth from You, increase his wealth and his children and make his life long.’”
4134 | It was narrated that Nuqadah Al-Asadi said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent me to a man whom he was talking to lend him a she-camel (for milking) and to be returned, but he refused. Then he sent me to another man, who sent a she-camel to him. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw it, he said: ‘O Allah, bless it and bless the one who sent it.’” Nuqadah said: "I said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): 'And for the one who brought it.' He said: 'And (bless) the one who brought it.' Then he ordered that it should be milked and it yielded plenty of milk. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'O Allah, increase the wealth of so-and-so,' meaning the first one who did not give a camel; 'and give so-and-so provision day by day,' meaning the one who had sent the she-camel."

4136 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Wretched is the slave of the Dinar, the slave of the Dirham and the slave of the Khamisah. He is wretched and will be thrown (into Hell) on his face, and if he is pricked with a thorn may find no relief.”

And I saw a handful of barley, nearly a Sa’, and some acacia leaves, in a corner of the room, and a skin hanging up. My eyes flowed with tears, and he said: ‘Why are you weeping, O son of Khattab?’ I said: ‘O Prophet of Allah, why should I not weep? This mat has made marks on your side, and this is all you have accumulated, I cannot see anything other than what I see (here), while Chosroes and Caesar live among fruits and rivers.

And beware of (saying) ‘If only,’ for ‘If only’ opens the door to Satan.”

4228 | It was narrated that Abu Kabshah Al-Anmari said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘The likeness of this nation is that of four people: A man to whom Allah gives wealth and knowledge, so he acts according to his knowledge with regard to his wealth, spending it as it should be spent; a man to whom Allah gives knowledge, but he does not give him wealth, so he says: “If I had been given (wealth) like this one, I would have done what (the first man) did.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘They will be equal in reward. And a man to whom Allah gives wealth but does not give knowledge, so he squanders his wealth and spends it in inappropriate ways; and a man to whom Allah gives neither knowledge nor wealth, and he says: “If I had (wealth) like this one, I would do what (the third man) did.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘They are equal in their burden (of sin).’”   A similar report (as above) was narrated from Ibn Abu Kabshah, from his father, from the Prophet (ﷺ).

If one misses him, another will befall him. The square is his life span, at his neck; and the line outside it is (his) hope.”

4235 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“If the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth, he would love to have a third along with them. Nothing could satisfy him except dust. And Allah accepts the repentance of the one who repents.”

Then I remembered how we had been, and I went out and met Abu Bakr, and said: ‘I have become a hypocrite!’ Abu Bakr said: ‘We all do that.’” So Hanzalah went and mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: “O Hanzalah, if you were (always) as you are with me, the angels would shake hands with you in your beds and in your streets. O Hanzalah, there is a time for this and a time for that.”

4242 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah said:“We said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, will we be taken to task for what we did in the Ignorance period?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever does good in Islam (i.e., after becoming a Muslim) he will not be taken to task for what he did in the Ignorance period, but whoever does evil (i.e., after entering Islam) he will be taken to task for both the former and the latter.’”
4243 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: ‘O ‘Aishah, beware of (evil) deeds that are regarded as insignificant, for they have a pursuer from Allah. (i.e. accountability).”
4244 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When the believer commits sin, a black spot appears on his heart. If he repents and gives up that sin and seeks forgiveness, his heart will be polished. But if (the sin) increases, (the black spot) increases. That is the Ran that Allah mentions in His Book: “Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn.” [83:14]
4245 | It was narrated from Thawban that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“I certainly know people of my nation who will come on the Day of Resurrection with good deeds like the mountains of Tihamah, but Allah will make them like scattered dust.” Thawban said: “O Messenger of Allah, describe them to us and tell us more, so that we will not become of them unknowingly.” He said: “They are your brothers and from your race, worshipping at night as you do, but they will be people who, when they are alone, transgress the sacred limits of Allah.”

4254 | It was narrated from Ibn Mas’ud that a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said that he had kissed a woman, and he started to ask about expiation, but he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) did not say anything to him. Then Allah revealed the Verse:“And perform prayers at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful.” [11:114] The man said: “O Messenger of Allah, is this (the Verse) just for me?” He said: “It is for whoever acts upon it among my nation.”
4255 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“A man went to extremes in committing sins. When death came to him, he left instructions to his sons, saying: ‘When I die, burn me, then grind me into powder, then scatter me in the wind and in the sea, for by Allah, if my Lord has power over me, He will subject me to a punishment that He has never subjected anyone to.’ So they did that to him, then (Allah) said to the earth: ‘Return what you have taken,’ and there he was, standing. He said to him: ‘What made you do what you have done?’ He said: ‘Fear of You, O Lord.’ So He forgave him because of that (fear).”
4256 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“A woman entered Hell because of a cat which she tied up and did not feed, or let it loose to eat of the vermin of the earth, until it died.”
4257 | It was narrated from Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Allah the Blessed and Exalted says: ‘O My slaves, all of you are sinners except those whom I have saved. So ask Me for forgiveness, I will forgive you. Whoever among you knows that I have the power to forgive and asks Me to forgive by My power, I will forgive him. All of you are astray except those whom I guide. Ask Me for guidance and I will guide you. All of you are poor except those whom I enrich (make independent of means). Ask of Me and I will grant you provision. Even if your living and your dead, your first and your last, your fresh and your dry, were all as pious as the most pious among My slaves, that would not increase my dominion as much as a gnat’s wing, and if they were to be as evil as the most evil among My slaves, that would not detract from My dominion as much as a gnat’s wing. Even if your living and your dead, your first and your last, your fresh and your dry, were to join together and each of them were to ask for all that he wishes for, that would only detract from My dominion as much as if one of you were to pass by the edge of the sea and dip a needle in it and withdraw it. That is because I am the Most Generous, Majestic. I give with a word; when I will something, all I do is say to it “Be!” – and it is.’”
4258 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Frequently remember the destroyer of pleasures,’ meaning death.”
4259 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“I was with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and a man from among the Ansar came to him and greeted the Prophet (ﷺ) with Salam. Then he said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, which of the believers is best?’ He said: ‘He who has the best manners among them.’ He said: ‘Which of them is wisest?’ He said: ‘The one who remembers death the most and is best in preparing for it. Those are the wisest.’”
4260 | It was narrated from Abu Ya’la Shaddad bin Aws that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The wise man is the one who takes account of himself and strives for that which is after death. And the helpless man is the one who follows his own whims then indulges in wishful thinking about Allah.”
4261 | It was narrated from Anas that the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon a young man who was dying and said:“How do you feel?” He said: “I have hope in Allah, O Messenger of Allah, but I fear my sins.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “These two things (hope and fear) do not coexist in the heart of a person in a situation like this, but Allah will give him that which he hopes for and keep him safe from that which he fears.”
4262 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Angels come to the dying person, and if the man was righteous, they say: ‘Come out, O good soul that was in a good body, come out praiseworthy and receive glad tidings of mercy and fragrance and a Lord Who is not angry.’ And this is repeated until it comes out, then it is taken up to heaven, and it is opened for it, and it is asked: ‘Who is this?’ They say: ‘So-and-so.’ It is said: ‘Welcome to the good soul that was in a good body. Enter praiseworthy and receive the glad tidings of mercy and fragrance and a Lord Who is not angry.’ And this is repeated until it is brought to the heaven above which is Allah. But if the man was evil, they say: ‘Come out O evil soul that was in an evil body. Come out blameworthy, and receive the tidings of boiling water and the discharge of dirty wounds,’ and other torments of similar kind, all together. And this is repeated until it comes out, then it is taken up to heaven and it is not opened for it. And it is asked: ‘Who is this?’ It is said: ‘So-and-so.’ And it is said: ‘No welcome to the evil soul that was in an evil body. Go back blameworthy, for the gates of heaven will not be opened to you.’ So it is sent back down from heaven, then it goes to the grave.”
4263 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“If the appointed time of death of anyone of you is in a certain land, some need will cause him to go there, then when he reaches the furthest point that it is decreed he will reach, Allah takes (his soul). And on the Day of Resurrection the earth will say: ‘My Lord, this is what You entrusted to me.’”
4264 | It was narrated from ‘Aishah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever loves to meet Allah, Allah loves to meet him, and whoever hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him.” It was said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, does hating to meet Allah mean hating to meet death? For all of us hate death.” He said: “No. Rather that is only at the moment of death. But if he is given the glad tidings of the mercy and forgiveness of Allah, he loves to meet Allah and Allah loves to meet him; and if he is given the tidings of the punishment of Allah, he hates to meet Allah and Allah hates to meet him.”
4265 | 4265 It was narrated from Anas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“None of you should wish for death because of some harm that befalls him. If he must wish for death, let him say: ‘O Allah, keep me alive so long as living is good for me and cause me to die when death is good for me.’”
4266 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There is no part of man that will not disintegrate, apart from a single bone at the base of the coccyx, from which he will be recreated on the Day of Resurrection.”
4267 | It was narrated that Hani’ the freed slave of ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan, said:“When ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan stood beside a grave, he would weep until his beard became wet. It was said to him: ‘You remember Paradise and Hell, and you do not weep, but you weep for this?’ He said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “The grave is the first stage of the Hereafter. Whoever is delivered from it, what comes after it is easier. If he is not delivered from it, then what comes after it is harder.’” He said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “I have never seen any horrible scene but the grave is more horrible.”
4268 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The dead person ends up in his grave, then the righteous man is made to sit up in his grave with no fear or panic. Then it is said to him: ‘What religion did you follow?’ He said: ‘I was in Islam.’ It is said to him: ‘Who is this man?’ He says: ‘Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He brought us clear signs from Allah and we believed him.’ It is said to him: ‘Have you seen Allah?’ He says: ‘No one is able to see Allah.’ Then a window to Hell is opened for him, and he sees it, parts of it destroying others. Then it is said to him: ‘Look at what Allah has saved you from.’ Then a window to Paradise is opened to him, and he looks at its beauty and what is in it. It is said to him: ‘This is your place.’ And it is said to him: ‘You had certain faith and you died in that state, and in that state you will be resurrected if Allah wills.’ And the evil man is made to sit up in his grave with fear and panic. It is said to him: ‘What religion did you follow?’ He says: ‘I do not know.’ It is said to him: ‘Who is this man?’ He says: ‘I heard the people saying something and I said it too.’ Then a window to Paradise is opened to him, and he looks at its beauty and what is in it. It is said to him: ‘Look at what Allah has diverted away from you.’ Then a window to Hell is opened for him, and he sees it, parts of it destroying others, and it is said to him: ‘This is your place. You were doubtful; in this state you died and in this state you will be resurrected, if Allah wills.’”
4269 | It was narrated from Bara’ bin ‘Azib that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm.” [14:27] This has been revealed concerning the torment of the grave. It will be said to him: ‘Who is your Lord?’ He will say: ‘My Lord is Allah, and my Prophet is Muhammad.’ This is what Allah says: Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allah Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter (i.e., at the time of questioning in the grave).’” [14:27]
4270 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“When anyone of you dies, he is shown his place morning and evening. If he is one of the people of Paradise, then he will be shown his seat in Paradise, and if he is one of the people of Hell, then he will be shown his seat in Hell. And it is said: ‘This is your place until you are raised on the Day of Resurrection.’”
4271 | It was narrated from ‘Abdur-Rahman bin Ka’b Al-Ansari that his father used to narrate that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The believer’s soul is a bird that eats from the trees of Paradise, until it will be returned to his body on the Day when he is resurrected.”
4272 | It was narrated from Jabir that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“When the deceased enters the grave, the sun is made to appear as if it is setting. He sits up, wipes his eyes and says: ‘Let me pray.’”
4273 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The two who are entrusted with the Trumpet have two horns in their hands, waiting until they will be commanded (to blow them).”
4274 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“A Jewish man said in the marketplace of Al-Madinah: ‘By the One Who chose Musa above all of mankind.’ An Ansari man raised his hand and slapped him. He said: ‘How dare you say this when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is among us?’ Mention of that was made to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he said: ‘Allah says: “And the trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown a second time, and behold they will be standing, looking on (waiting).” [39:68] I will be the first one to raise his head, and I will see Musa holding on to one of the pillars of the Throne, and I do not know whether he will have raised his head before me, or he will be one of those whom Allah exempts. And whoever says that I am better than Yunus bin Matta, he is lying.”
4275 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say on the pulpit: ‘The Compeller (Al-Jabbar) will seize His heavens and His earths in His Hand’ – and he clenched his hand and started to open and close it – ‘Then He will say: “I am the Compeller, I am the King. Where are the tyrants? Where are the arrogant?” And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was leaning to his right and his left, until I could see the pulpit shaking at the bottom, and I thought that it would fall along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).”
4276 | It was narrated that Qasim said:‘Aishah said: “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, how will the people be gathered on the Day of Resurrection?’ He said: ‘Barefoot and naked.’ I said: ‘And the women?’ He said: ‘And the women.’ I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, will we not feel embarrassed?’ He said: ‘O ‘Aishah, the matter will be too serious for them to look at one another.’”
4277 | It was narrated from Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The people will be presented (before Allah) three times on the Day of Resurrection. The first two times will be for disputes and excuses, and the third time will be when the scrolls (of deeds) fly into their hands; some will take it in the right hand and some in the left.”
4278 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of all that exists.” [83:6] One of them will stand in his sweat up to halfway up his ears.”
4279 | It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): “On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens.” [14:48] – where will the people be on that Day?’ He said: ‘On the Sirat (the Bridge across Hell-fire).’”
4280 | Abu Sa’eed narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The Sirat will be placed across Hell, on thorns like the thorns of Sa’dan plant.* Then the people will cross it. Some will pass over safe and sound, some will be detained, and some will fall in headfirst.”
4281 | It was narrated from Hafsah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“I hope that no one of those who witnessed (the battle of) Badr and (Treaty) Hudaybiyah will enter Hell, if Allah wills.” I said: “O Messenger of Allah, doesn’t Allah say “There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell); this is with your Lord, a decree which must be accomplished?” [19:71] He said: “Have you not heard that He says: ‘Then We shall save those who use to fear Allah and were dutiful to Him. And We shall leave the wrongdoers therein (humbled) to their knees (in Hell)?’” [19:72]
4282 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“You will come to me with radiant faces, hands and feet from the traces of ablution. This is the characteristic sign of my nation which does not belong to anyone else.”
4283 | It was narrated that ‘Abdullah said:“We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a tent, and he said: ‘Will it not please you to be one quarter of the people of Paradise?’ We said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Will it not please you to be one third of the people of Paradise?’ We said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise. For no one will enter Paradise but a Muslim soul, and among the people of polytheism you are like a white hair on the hide of a black bull, or like a black hair on the hide of a red bull.’”
4284 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“A Prophet will come accompanied by two men, and a Prophet will come accompanied by three, and (some will come) with more or less than that. It will be said to him: ‘Did you convey the message to your people?’ And he will say: ‘Yes.’ Then his people will be called and it will be said: ‘Did he convey the message to you?’ They will say: ‘No.’ Then it will be said: ‘Who will bear witness for you?’ He will say: ‘Muhammad and his nation.’ So the nation of Muhammad will be called and it will be said: ‘Did this man convey the message?’ They will say: ‘Yes.’ He will say: ‘How did you know that?’ They will say: ‘Our Prophet told us that the Messengers had conveyed the message, and we believed him.’ This is what Allah says: “Thus We have made you, a just (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad (ﷺ)) be a witness over you.’” [2:143]
4285 | It was narrated that Rifa’ah Al-Juhani said:“We came back (from a campaign) with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: ‘By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, there is no person who believes then stands firm, but he will be caused to enter Paradise. I hope that they will not enter it until you and those who are righteous among your offspring will enter it and take up your dwelling places therein. And my Lord has promised me that seventy thousand of my nation will enter Paradise without being brought to account.’”
4286 | Abu Umamah Al-Bahili said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘My Lord has promised me that seventy thousand of my nation will enter Paradise without being brought to account or punished. With every thousand will be (another) seventy thousand, and three handfuls of my Lord, the Glorified.’”
4287 | It was narrated from Bahz bin Hakim, from his father, that his grandfather said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘On the Day of Resurrection, we will complete seventy nations, of whom we are the last and the best.’”
4288 | It was narrated from Bahz bin Hakim, from his father, that his grandfather said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘You complete seventy nations, of which you are the best and dearest to Allah.’”
4289 | It was narrated from Sulaiman bin Buraidah, from his father, that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The people of Paradise are one hundred and twenty ranks, eighty from this nation and forty from all other nations.”
4290 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“We are the last of the nations, and the first to be brought to account. It will be said: ‘Where is the unlettered nation and its Prophet?’ So we are the last and the first.”
4291 | It was narrated from Abu Burdah that his father said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘When Allah gathers all creatures on the Day of Resurrection, permission will be given to the nation of Muhammad to prostrate, so they will prostrate to Him for a long time. Then it will be said: “Raise your heads, for a certain number of you will go to Hell-fire and these will be your ransom from Hell.”*
4292 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“This nation has been granted mercy (in the Hereafter) and its torment (in this world) is at the hands of one another. When the Day of Resurrection comes, each Muslim man will be given a man from among the idolaters and it will be said: ‘This is your ransom from the Fire.’”
4293 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Allah has one hundred (degrees of) mercy, of which He has shared one between all of creation, by virtue of which you show mercy and compassion towards one another and the wild animals show compassion towards their young. And He has kept back ninety-nine (degrees of) mercy by virtue of which He will show mercy to His slaves on the Day of Resurrection.”
4294 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“On the day when He created the heavens and the earth, Allah created one hundred (degrees of) mercy, of which He placed one on earth, by virtue of which mothers show compassion to their children and animals as well as the birds show compassion to one another. And He kept back ninety-nine (degrees of) mercy. When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will complete this mercy.”
4295 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When Allah created the universe, He decreed for Himself: ‘My mercy prevails over My wrath.’”
4296 | It was narrated that Mu’adh bin Jabal said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed by me when I was riding a donkey, and said: ‘O Mu’adh, do you know what Allah’s right over His slaves is and what His slaves’ right over Allah is?’ I said: ‘Allah and His Messenger know best.’ He said: ‘The right of Allah over His slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him. And the right of the slaves over Allah, if they do that, is that He should not punish them.’”
4297 | It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on one of his campaigns. He passed by some people and said: ‘Who are these people?’ They said: ‘We are Muslims.’ There was a woman putting wood in her oven, and a son of hers was with her. When the flames got higher, she moved him away. She came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘Are you the Messenger of Allah?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ She said: ‘May my father and mother be ransomed for you. Is not Allah the Most Merciful of those who show mercy?’ He said: ‘Yes indeed.’ She said: ‘Is not Allah more Merciful than a mother to her child?’ He said: ‘Yes indeed.’ She said: ‘A mother would not throw her child into the fire.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lowered his head and wept. Then he looked up at her and said: ‘Allah does not punish any of His slaves except those who are defiant and rebellious, who rebel against Allah and refuse to say: La ilaha illallah.’”
4298 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “No one will enter Hell except one who is doomed.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, who is the one who is doomed?” He said: “The one who never does any act of obedience (towards Allah) and who never omitted any act of sin.”
4299 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited this Verse:“He (Allah) is the One, deserving that mankind should be afraid of, and should be dutiful to Him, and should not take any Ilah (god) along with Him, and He is the One Who forgives (sins).” [74:56] Then he said: “Allah says: ‘I am the One Who deserves to be feared, so no other god should be appointed alongside Me. Whoever avoids appointing another god alongside Me, I am the One Who should forgive him.”  Another chain reports a similar hadith.
4300 | ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“A man from my nation will be called before all of creation on the Day of Resurrection, and ninety-nine scrolls will be spread out for him, each one extending as far as the eye can see. Then Allah will say: “Do you deny anything of this?” He will say: “No, O Lord.” He will say: “Have My recording scribes been unfair to you?” Then He will say: “Apart from that, do you have any good deeds?” The man will be terrified and will say: “No.” (Allah) will say: “Indeed, you have good deeds with Us, and you will not be treated unjustly this Day.” Then a card will be brought out on which is written Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah wa anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger). He will say: “O Lord, what is this card compared with these scrolls?” He will say: “You will not be treated unjustly.” Then the scrolls will be placed in one side of the Balance and the card in the other. The scrolls will go up (i.e., be light) and the card will go down (i.e., will weigh heavily).”
4301 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“I have a Cistern, (as large as the distance) between the Ka’bah and Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem). (It is) whiter than milk, and its vessels are the number of the stars. I will be the Prophet with the most followers on the Day of Resurrection.”
4302 | It was narrated from Hudhaifah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“My Cistern is wider than the distance between Ailah and ‘Aden. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, its vessels are more numerous than the number of stars, and it is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I will drive men away from it as a man drives strange camels away from his cistern.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, will you recognize us?” He said: “Yes, you will come to me with radiant faces, hands and feet, because of the traces of ablution, and this is not for anyone but you.”
4303 | It was narrated that Abu Sallam Al-Habashi said:“Umar bin ‘Abdul-‘Aziz sent for me and I came to him upon the riding animal prepared for swift mail delivery. When I came to him, he said: ‘We have caused you some trouble O Abu Sallam.’ He said: ‘Yes, by Allah, O Commander of the Believers!’ He said: ‘By Allah, we did not want to cause you any hardship, but there is a Hadith which I have heard that you narrate from Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), concerning the Cistern, and I wanted to hear it directly from you.’ He said: “I said: ‘Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), told me that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “My Cistern is (wider than) the distance between Ailah and ‘Aden. It is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey, and its cups are as many as the stars in the sky. Whoever drinks from it will never feel thirst again. The first ones who come to drink from it will be the poor Muhajirin, with dirty clothes and disheveled hair, who do not marry refined women and for whom no doors are opened.” ‘Umar wept until his beard became wet, then he said: ‘But I have married refined women and doors have been opened for me. Certainly I will not wash the clothes that are on my body until they become dirt, and I will not comb my hair until it becomes disheveled.’”
4304 | It was narrated from Anas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The distance between the two ends of my Cistern is like the distance between San’a and Al-Madinah,’ or ‘between Al-Madinah and ‘Amman.’”
4305 | Anas bin Malik narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:‘One can see in it (the Cistern) jugs of gold and silver, like the number of stars in the sky.”
4306 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) came to a graveyard and greeted (its occupants) with Salam, then he said:“Peace be upon you, abode of believing people. We will join you soon, if Allah wills.” Then he said: “Would that we could see our brothers.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, are we not your brothers?” He said: “You are my Companions. My brothers are those who will come after me. I will reach the Cistern ahead of you.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, how will you recognize those of your nation who have not yet come?” He said: “If a man has a horse with a blaze on its forehead and white feet, don’t you think that he will recognize it among horses that are deep black in color?” They said: “Of course.” He said: “On the Day of Resurrection they will come with radiant faces, hands, and feet, because of the traces of ablution.” He said: “I will reach the Cistern ahead of you.” Then he said: “Men will be driven away from my Cistern just as stray camels are driven away. And I will call to them: ‘Come here!’ But it will be said: ‘They changed after you were gone, and they kept turning on their heels.’ So I will say: “Be off with you!”
4307 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Every Prophet had a prayer that was answered, and every Prophet offered this prayer in this world. But I am saving my prayer so that I can intercede for my nation, and it reaches every one of them who dies not associating anything with Allah.”
4308 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“I am the leader of the sons of Adam, and it is no boast. I will be the first one for whom the earth will be split open on the Day of Resurrection, and it is no boast. I will be the first to intercede and the first whose intercession will be accepted, and it is no boast. The banner of praise will be in my hand on the Day of Resurrection, and it is no boast.”
4309 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“As for the people of Hell, who are its people (i.e., its permanent residents), they will neither die nor live therein. But there are some people who will be punished with fire because of their sins, whom it will kill, then when they have become like coal, permission will be granted for intercession for them. They will be brought, group by group, and scattered on the banks of the rivers of Paradise. It will be said: ‘O people of Paradise, pour water on them.’ Then they will grow like seeds carried by a flood (i.e., quickly).” A man among the people said: It is as if the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has been in the desert.”
4310 | It was narrated that Jabir said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘My intercession on the Day of Resurrection will be for those among my nation who committed major sins.’”
4311 | It was narrated from Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“I was given the choice between being admitted to Paradise, and I chose intercession, because it is more general and more sufficient. Do you think it is for the pious? No, it is for the impure sinners.”
4312 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The believers will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection, inspired or worried.” – Sa’eed was not sure – “And they will say: ‘If we seek someone to intercede for us with our Lord, we may find relief from our situation.’ So they will go to Adam and will say: ‘You are Adam, the father of mankind. Allah created you with His Hand and His angels prostrated to you. Intercede for us with your Lord, that He might grant us relief from our situation.’ He will say: ‘I am not the one,’ and he will mention to them and complain of the sin that he committed. He will feel too shy to do that (and will say): ‘Rather go to Nuh, for he is the first Messenger whom Allah sent to the people of earth.’ So they will go to him, but he will say: ‘I am not the one,’ and he will mention of how he asked of Allah that of which he had no knowledge.* He will feel too shy to do that (and will say): ‘Rather go to the Close Friend of the Most Merciful, Ibrahim.’ So they will go to him and he will say: ‘I am not the one. Rather go to Musa, a slave to whom Allah spoke and to whom He gave the Torah.’ So they will go to him and he will say: ‘I am not the one,’ and he will mention how he killed a soul, not in retaliation for murder (and will say): ‘Rather go to ‘Isa, the slave of Allah and His Messenger, the Word of Allah and a spirit created by Him.’ So they will go to him, but he will say: ‘I am not the one. Rather go to Muhammad, a slave whose past and future sins Allah forgave.’ So they will come to me and I will go with them.” – There was a similar report from Hasan who added (the Prophet (ﷺ) said:) And I will walk between two rows of the believers.” Then he went back to the Hadith of Anas. – And he said: “And I will ask my Lord for permission and permission will be given to me. When I see Him I will fall down prostrating, and I will be left as long as Allah wills to leave me. Then it will be said: ‘Get up, O Muhammad. Speak, you will be heard; ask, you will be given; intercede, your intercession will be accepted.’ I will praise Him with praise that He will teach me, then I will intercede, and a limit will be set. Then they will be admitted to Paradise, and I will come back a second time. When I see Him I will fall down prostrating, and I will be left as long as Allah wills to leave me. Then it will be said: ‘Get up, O Muhammad. Speak, you will be heard; ask, you will be given; intercede, your intercession will be accepted.’ I will praise Him with praise that He will teach me, then I will intercede, and a limit will be set. Then they will be admitted to Paradise, and I will come back a third time. When I see Him I will fall down prostrating, and I will be left as long as Allah wills to leave me. Then it will be said: ‘Get up, O Muhammad. Speak, you will be heard; ask, you will be given; intercede, your intercession will be accepted.’ I will praise Him with praise that He will teach me, then I will intercede, and a limit will be set. Then they will be admitted to Paradise, and I will come back a fourth time and will say: ‘O Lord, there is no one left except those who are detained by the Qur’an.’” **  Qatadah (the Tabi'ee in the chain) would narrate after this hadith that Anas (ra) said "Those who said 'La illaha illa Allah' (there is no god except Allah) and had the weight of a grain of barley in good in his heart will come out of the Fire, and those who said 'La illaha illa Allah' and had a weight of a grain of wheat in good in his heart will come out of the Fire, and those who said 'La illaha illa Allah' and had a weight of a grain of dust in good in his heart will come out of the Fire."
4313 | It was narrated from ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Three will intercede on the Day of Resurrection: The Prophets, then the scholars, then the martyrs.”
4314 | It was narrated from Ubayy bin Ka’b, from his father, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When the Day of Resurrection comes, I will be the leader of the Prophets and the one who addresses them, and the one among them who will agree to intercede, and it is no boast.”
4315 | It was narrated from ‘Imran bin Husain that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Some people will be brought forth from Hell by my intercession, who will be called Al-Jahannamiyyin (those who came out of Hell).”
4316 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin Abi Jad’a’ that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say:“More than (the members of the tribe of) Banu Tamim will enter Paradise through the intercession of a man from among my nation.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, besides you?” He said: “Besides me.”
4317 | ‘Awf bin Malik Al-Ashja’i said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Do you know what choice my Lord gave me on this night?’ We said: ‘Allah and His Messenger know best.’ He said: ‘He gave me the choice between admitting half of my nation to Paradise and intercession, and I chose intercession.’ We said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, pray that we will be among its people (the people for whom you will intercede).’ He said: ‘It is for every Muslim.’”
4318 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“This fire of yours is one-seventieth part of the fire of Hell. Were it not that its heat has been reduced by water twice, you would not have been able to benefit from it. And it is praying to Allah, asking Allah not to return it (to its original level of heat).”
4319 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The Fire complained to its Lord and said: ‘O Lord, parts of me have consumed other parts.’ So He gave it two occasions to exhale, one in winter and one in summer. The intense cold that you feel (in winter) is part of its severe frost (Zamharir) and the intense heat that you feel in summer is part of its hot wind (Samum).”
4320 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The Hell-Fire was kindled for one thousand years and turned white. Then it was kindled for another thousand years and it turned red. Then it was kindled for another thousand years and it turned black. So it is black like the darkest night.”
4321 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“On the Day of Resurrection the disbeliever who lived the most luxurious will be brought, and it will be said: ‘Dip him once in Hell.’ So he will be dipped in it, then it will be said to him: ‘O so- and-so, have you every enjoyed any pleasure?’ He will say: ‘No, I have never enjoyed any pleasure.’ Then the believer who suffered the most hardship and trouble will be brought and it will be said: ‘Dip him once in Paradise.’ So he will be dipped in it and it will be said to him: ‘O so-and-so, have you ever suffered any hardship or trouble?’ He will say: ‘I have never suffered any hardship or trouble.’”
4322 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The disbeliever will be made huge so much so that his molar will be bigger than (Mount) Uhud, and the size of his body in relation to his molar will be like the size of the body of anyone of you in relation to his molar.”
4323 | ‘Abdullah bin Qais said:“I was with Abu Burdah one night, and Harith bin Uqaish entered upon us. Harith told us that night that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Among my nation are some by whose intercession more (than the members of the tribe of) Mudar will enter Paradise, and among my nation are some who will be made huge for the Fire until they fill one of its corners.’”
4324 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The people of Hell will be made to weep and they will weep until they run out of tears. Then they will weep blood until something like trenches appear on their faces, and if ships were placed in them they would float.”
4325 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited:“O you who believe! Have fear of Allah as is His due, and die not except as Muslims. [3:102] (Then he said): ‘If a drop of Zaqqum were to be dropped on the earth, it would ruin the livelihood of the people of this world, so how about those who have no food other than it (i.e. Zaqqum)?’”
4326 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“The Fire will consume all of the son of Adam except the mark of prostration. Allah has forbidden the Fire to consume the mark of prostration.’”
4327 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:‘Death will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and made to stand on the Sirat (the Bridge over Hell). It will be said: “O people of Paradise!” And they will look. Anxious and afraid lest they be brought out of the place they are in. Then it will be said: “O people of Hell!” and they will look, hoping that they will be brought out of the place they are in. Then it will be said: “Do you know what this is?” They will say: “Yes, this is Death.” Then the command will be given for it to be slaughtered on the Sirat, and it will be said to both groups: “It is eternal wherever you are, and there will never be any death therein.”
4328 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Allah says: ‘I have prepared for My righteous slaves that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and it has never crossed the mind of man.’”
4329 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“A hand span in Paradise is better than the earth and everything on it.”
4330 | It was narrated from Sahl bin Sa’d that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“A place the size of a whip in Paradise is better than this world and everything in it.”
4331 | Mu’adh bin Jabal said:“I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Paradise has one hundred grades, each of which is as big as the distance between heaven and earth. The highest of them is Firdaws and the best of them is Firdaws. The Throne is above Firdaws and from it spring forth the rivers of Paradise. If you ask of Allah, ask Him for Firdaws.’”
4332 | Usamah bin Zaid said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said one day to his Companions: ‘Who will strive hard with sincerity for Paradise? For there is nothing like Paradise. By the Lord of the Ka’bah, it is sparkling light, sweet basil waving in the breeze, a lofty palace, a flowing river, abundant ripe fruit, a beautiful wife and many fine garments, in a palace of eternal abode, in ease and luxury, in beautiful, strongly-built, lofty houses.’ They said: ‘We will strive heard for it, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘Say: In sha’ Allah (if Allah wills).’ Then he mentioned Jihad and encouraged them to engage in it.”
4333 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“The first group to enter Paradise will enter with (faces) like the moon in the night when it is full. Then those who follow them will be shining with a light brighter than the brightest star in the sky. They will not urinate or defecate, or blow their noses or spit. Their combs will be of gold, their sweat will be musk, their braziers (receptacle for holding live coals for burning incense) will be pearls and their wives will be houris. Their form will be that of a single man, the form of their father Adam, sixty forearm’s length tall.’”  Another chain reports the same.
4334 | It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Kauthar is a river in Paradise whose banks are of gold and its bed is of rubies and pearls. Its soil is more fragrant than musk, its water is sweeter than honey and whiter than snow.”
4335 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“In Paradise there is a tree under whose shade a rider could travel for one hundred years and never leave it.” "Recite, if you wish: 'And in shade long-extended (56:30).'"
4336 | Sa’eed bin Al-Musayyab said that he met Abu Hurairah and Abu Hurairah said:“I supplicate Allah to bring you and I together in the marketplace of Paradise,” Sa’eed said: “Is there a marketplace there?” He said: “Yes. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told me that when the people of Paradise enter it, they will take their places according to their deeds, and they will be given permission for a length of time equivalent to Friday on earth, when they will visit Allah. His Throne will be shown to them and He will appear to them in one of the gardens of Paradise. Chairs of light and chairs of pearls and chairs of rubies and chairs of chrysolite and chairs of gold and chairs of silver will be placed for them. Those who are of a lower status than them, and none of them will be regarded as insignificant, will sit on sandhills of musk and camphor, and they will not feel that those who are sitting on chairs are seated better than them.”  Abu Hurairah said: “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord?’ He said: ‘Yes. Do you dispute that you see the sun and the moon on the night when it is full?’ We said: ‘No.’ He said: ‘Likewise, you will not dispute that you see your Lord, the Glorified. There will be no one left in that gathering with whom Allah does not speak face to face, until He will say to a man among you: “Do you not remember, O so-and-so, the day you did such and such?” And He will remind him of some of his sins in this world. He will say: “O Lord, have You not forgiven me?” He will say: “Yes, it is by the vastness of My forgiveness that You have reached the position you are in.” While they are like that, a cloud will cover them from above and will rain down on them perfume the like of whose fragrance they have never smelled before. Then He will say: “Get up and go to the honor that has been prepared for you, and take whatever you desire.” So we will go to a marketplace surrounded by the angels, in which there will be such things as eyes have never seen, ears have never heard and it has not entered the heart of man. Whatever we desire will be carried for us. Nothing will be bought or sold therein. In that marketplace the people of Paradise will meet one another. A man of elevated status will meet those who are of lower status than him, but none shall be regarded as insignificant, and he will be dazzled by the clothes that he sees on him. He will not finish the last of his conversation before better clothes appear on him. That is because no one should be sad there.’” “He said: ‘Then we will go back to our homes where we will be met by our wives, and they will say: ‘Welcome. You have come looking more handsome and with a better fragrance than when you left us.’ And we will say: ‘Today we sat with our Lord, the Compeller, the Glorified, and we deserve to come back as we have come back.’”
4337 | It was narrated from Abu Umamah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There is no one whom Allah will admit to Paradise but Allah will marry him to seventy-two wives, two from houris and seventy from his inheritance from the people of Hell, all of whom will have desirable front passages and he will have a male member that never becomes flaccid (i.e., soft and limp).’”
4338 | It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When the believer wants a child in Paradise, he will be conceived and born and grown up, in a short while, according to his desire.”
4339 | It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“I know the last of the people of Hell who will be brought forth from it, and the last of the people of Paradise to be admitted to Paradise. (It is) a man who will emerge from Hell crawling, and it will be said to him: ‘Go and enter Paradise.’ He will come to it and it will be made to appear to him as if it is full.’ Allah will say: ‘Go and enter Paradise.’ He will come to it and it will appear to him as if it is full. So he will say: ‘O Lord, I found it full.’ Allah will say: ‘Go and enter Paradise.’ He will come to it and it will be made to appear to him as if it is full. So he will say: ‘O Lord, I found it full.’ Allah will say: ‘Go and enter Paradise, for you will have the like of the world and ten times more, or you will have ten times the like of the world.’ He will say: ‘Are You mocking me, or are You laughing at me, when You are the Sovereign?’” He said: "And I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiling so broadly that his molar teeth could be seen." And he used to say: "This is the lowest of the people of Paradise in status."
4340 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever asks for Paradise, three times, Paradise will say: “O Allah, admit him to Paradise.” And whoever asked to be saved from Hell, three times, Hell will say: “O Allah, save him from Hell.”
4341 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“There is no one among you who does not have two abodes: An abode in Paradise and an abode in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise inherit his abode. This is what Allah says: ‘These are indeed the inheritors.’” [23:10]
