1 | It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"When any one of you wakes from sleep, let him not dip his hand in (the water he uses for) his Wudu' until he has washed it three times, for none of you knows where his hand spent the night." 
2 | ,It was narrated that Huthaifah said:"When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up at night, he would brush his mouth with the Siwak." 
3 | ,It was narrated that Abu Musa said:"I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he was using the Siwak, and the end of the Siwak was on his toungue, and he was saying, "'A','a'." 
4 | ,It was narrated from Abu Burdah that Abu Musa said:"I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was using the Siwak and with me were two men of the Ash'aris - one on my right and the other on my left - who were seeking to be appointed as officials. I said: 'By the One Who sent you as a Prophet with the truth, they did not tell me why they wanted to come with me and I did not realize that they were seeking to be appointed as officials.' And I could see his Siwak beneath his lip, then it slipped and he said: 'We do not' - or; 'We will never appoint as an official anyone who seeks that. Rather you should go.'" So he sent his (Abu Musa) to Yemen, then he sent Mu'adh bin Jabal to go after him - may Allah be pleased with them. 
5 | ,'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu 'Atiq said:"My father told me: 'I heard 'Aishah say, (narrating) from the Prophet (ﷺ): "Siwak is a means of purification for the mouth and is pleasing to the Lord." 
6 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'I have indeed urged you with regard to the Siwak.'" 
7 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Were it not that it would be too difficult for my Ummah, I would have commanded them to use the Siwak at (the time of) every Salah." 
8 | ,It was narrated from Al-Miqdam - Abu Shuraih - that his father said:"I said to 'Aishah: 'What did the Prophet (ﷺ) start with when he entered his house?' She said: 'The Siwak.'" 
9 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"The Fitrah are five: Circumcision, removing the pubes, trimming the mustache, clipping the nails, and plucking the armpit hairs." 
10 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The Fitrah are five: Trimming the mustache, plucking the armpit hairs, clipping the nails, removing the pubes, and circumcision.'" 
11 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"The Fitrah are five: Circumcision, shaving the pubes, plucking the armpit hairs, clipping the nails and taking from the mustache." 
12 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"The deeds connected to the Fitrah are: Clipping the nails, removing the mustache and shaving the pubes." 
13 | ,It was narrated that Zaid bin Arqam said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever does not trim his mustache, he is not from one of us.'" 
14 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"A time limit was set for us, by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), regarding trimming the mustache, clipping the nails and plucking the pubes; we were not to leave that for more than forty days," on one occasion he said: "Forty nights." 
15 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Trim the mustache and let the beard grow." 
16 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Qurad said:"I went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to an isolated area, and when he wanted to relieve himself he moved far away." 
17 | ,It was narrated from Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah that when the Prophet (ﷺ) would go away (to relieve himself) he would go far away. He went to relieve himself when he was on one of his journeys, and said:"Bring me (water for) Wudu'." So I brought him (water for) Wudu', and he performed Wudu' and wiped over his Khuffs. The Shaikh [1] said: "Isma'il (one of the narrators) is Ibn Ja'far bin Abi Kathir Al-Qari.  [1] Meaning the author, and it appears that Ibn As-Sunni who heard the text, said this. 
18 | ,It was narrated that Hudhaifah said:"I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he came to some people's garbage dump and urinated while standing up. I turned to go away, but he called me back (to conceal him), and I was just behind him. Then when he had finished, he performed Wudu' and wiped over his Khuffs." 
19 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered Al-Khala' (the toilet) and said: 'Allahumma inni a'uthu bika min al-khubuthi wal-khaba'ith (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from male and female devils)."[1]   [1] See Ma'alam As-Sunan by Al-Khattabi. And Al-Khala' is the area one relieves oneself in. It refers to outside or other than that, it should not be understood to mean toilet only. 
20 | ,It was narrated from Rafi' bin Ishaq that he heard Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari say - when he was in Egypt:"By Allah, I do not know what I should do with these Karais (toilets). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'When any one of you goes to defecate or urinate, let him not face toward the Qiblah, nor turn his back towards it." 
21 | ,It was narrated from Abu Ayyub that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Do not face towards the Qiblah nor turn your backs toward it when defecating or urinating, rather face toward the east or the west." 
22 | ,It was narrated that Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'When any one of you goes to defecate, let him not face toward the Qiblah, rather let him face towards the east or the west.'" 
23 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said:"I climbed on the roof of our house and saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on two bricks, facing toward Bait Al-Maqdis (jerusalem), relieving himself." 
24 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Abi Qatadah, from his father, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ said:"When any one of you urinates, let him not hold his penis in his  right hand." 
25 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Abi Qatadah that his father said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'When any one of you enters Al-Khala' (the toilet), let him not touch his penis with his right hand.'" 
26 | ,It was narrated from Hudhifah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)came to some people's garbage dump and urinated while standing. 
27 | ,It was narrated that Mansur said:"I heard Abu Wa'il (say) that Hudhaifah said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to some people's garbage dump and urinated while standing.'" 
28 | ,It was narrated from Hudhaifah that the Prophet (ﷺ) went to some people's garbage dump and urinated while standing. In his narration, Sulaiman bin 'Ubaidullah said:"And he wiped over his Khuffs," but Mansur did not mention the wiping. [1]  [1]Meaning, in this route, since Shu'bah narrated it from both Sulaiman and Mansur. 
29 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Whoever tells you that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) urinated standing up, do not believe him, for he would not urinate except while squatting." 
30 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdur-Rahman bin Hasanah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out to us with a small leather shield in his hand. He put it down, then he sat behind it and urinated toward it. Some of the people said: 'Look, he is urinating like a woman.' He heard that and said: 'Do you not know what happened to the companion of the Children of Israel? If they got any urine on themselves they would clip that part of their garments off. Their companion told them not to do that and he was punished in his grave.'" 
31 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed by two graves and said: 'These two are being punished, but they are not being punished for something that was difficult to avoid. As for this, he used not to take precautions to avoid (his body to clothes being soiled by) urine, and this one used to walk around spreading malicious gossip.' Then he called for a fresh palm-leaf stalk and split it in two, and placed one piece on each of the two graves. They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, why did you do that?' He said: 'Perhaps the torment will be reduced for them so long as this does not dry out.'"  Mansur Contradicted him, he reported it from Mujahid from ibn 'Abbas but he did not mention Tawus in it. 
32 | ,It was narrated that Umaimah bint Ruqaiqah said:"The Prophet (ﷺ) had a vessel made from a date tree in which he would urinate and place it under the bed." 
33 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"They say that the Prophet (ﷺ) made a will for 'Ali,[1] but he called for a basin in which to urinate, then he went flaccid suddenly (and died), so how could he leave a will?!"  The Shaikh said: Azhar (one of the narrators) is Ibn Sa'd As-Samman.  [1] Meaning, appointing him as the Khalifah. 
34 | ,It was narrated from Qatadah, from 'Abdullah bin Sarjis, that the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) said:"None of you should urinate into a burrow in the ground." They said to Qatadah: "Why is it disliked to urinate into a burrow in the ground?" He said: "It is said that these are dwelling-places of the jinn." 
35 | ,It was narrated from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade urinating into standing water. 
36 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Mughaffal that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"None of you should urinate in the place where he bathes, for most Waswas (devilish whispers) [1] come from that."  [1] I.e., with regard to whether the urine has soiled his body or not. 
37 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Umar said:"A man passed by the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was urinating and greeted him with Salam, but he did not return his greeting." 
38 | ,It was narrated from Al-Muhajir bin Qunfudh that he greeted the Prophet (ﷺ) with Salam while he was urinating, and he did not return the greeting until he had performed Wudu'. When he had performed Wudu' he returned the greeting. 
39 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade cleaning oneself with bones or dung. 
40 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"I am like a father teaching you. When any one of you goes to Al-Khala' (the toilet), let him not face toward the Qiblah nor turn his back toward it, and let him not clean himself with his right hand." And he used to tell them to use three stones, and he forbade using dung or old bones. 
41 | ,It was narrated that Salman said, that a man said to him:"Your companion (meaning, the Prophet(ﷺ)) even teaches you how to go to the toilet!" He said: "Yes, he forbade us from facing the Qiblah when defecating or urinating, or cleaning ourselves with out right hands, or to use less than three stones." 
42 | ,'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad (narrated) from his father that he heard 'Abdullah say:"The Prophet (ﷺ) wanted to defecate, and he told me to bring him three stones. I found two stones and looked for a third, but I could not find any, so I picked up a piece of dung and brought them to the Prophet (ﷺ). He took the two stones and three away the dung and said: "This is Riks."  Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasai') said: Riks is the food of the jinn. 
43 | ,It was narrated from Salamah bin Qais that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"When you clean yourselves (with stones, after defecating), use an odd number." 
44 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"When any one of you goes to the Gha'it (toilet to defecate), let him take with him three stones and clean himself with them, for that will suffice him." 
45 | ,Anas bin Malik said:"When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would go to the toilet, I and another boy like me would bring a small leather vessel of water and he would clean himself with water." 
46 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Tell your husbands to clean themselves with water, for I am too shy to tell them myself. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do that." 
47 | ,It was narrated from Abu Qatadah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"When any one of you drinks, let him not breathe into the vessel, and when he goes to the toilet let him not touch his penis with his right hand, nor wipe himself with this right hand." 
48 | ,It was narrated from Ibn Abi Qatadah, from his father, that the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade breathing into the vessel (when drinking), touching one's penis with one's right hand, and cleaning oneself with one's right hand. 
49 | ,It was narrated that Salman said:"The idolators said: 'We see that your companion teaches you how to go to the toilet.' He said: 'Yes, he forbade us from cleaning ourselves with our right hand, and from facing toward the Qiblah, and he said: 'None of you should clean with less than three stones.'" 
50 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) performed Wudu', and when he had performed Istinja' he rubbed his hand on the ground. 
51 | ,Ibrahim bin Jarir narrated that his father said:"I was with the Prophet (ﷺ) and he went to Al Khala' (toilet) and relieved himself, then he said: "O Jarir, bring Tahur (a means of purification)." So I brought him some water and he performed Intinja' with water, and did like this with hand, rubbing it on the ground.   Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: "This resembles more with what is correct than the (previous) narration of Sharik, and Allah knows best." 
52 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Umar that his father said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked about water and how some animals and carnivorous beasts might drink from it. He said: 'If the water is more than two Qullahs, it will not carry filth.'"[1]  [1]It comes with some explanation in Sunan At Timidhi 'Abdah (one of the narrators) said: "Muhammad bin Ishaq said: 'A Qullah refers to Jirar (These are two nouns describing large casks that are used to hold water), and a Qullah is the thing that drinking water is held in."' At-Tirmidhi said: "This is the saying of Ash Shafa'i, Ahmad and Ishaq. They say that when the water is two Qullahs then nothing makes it impure, as long as it does not change its smell, and its taste. And they say, it is approximately fifty Qirbahs (waterskins)." 
53 | ,It was narrated from Anas that a Bedouin urinated in the Masjid, and some of the people went after him, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Leave him and do not restrain him." When he had finished he called for a bucket (of water) and poured it over it. [1]  Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: "Meaning: 'Do not interrupt him.'"  [1]The author will cite this narration again in No. 330 as a possible proof for setting the minimum, since it mentions "a bucket" as if this is the minium amount required. 
54 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"A Bedouin urinated in the Masjid, and the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that a bucket (be brought) and poured over it." 
55 | ,Anas said:"A Bedouin came to the Masjid and urinated, and the people yelled at him, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Leave him alone.' So they left him alone. When he had finished urinating, he ordered that a bucket (be brought) and poured over it." 
56 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"A Bedouin stood up and urinated in the Masjid, ans the people started shouting. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to them: 'Leave him alone, and spill a bucket of water over his urine. For you have been sent to make things easy for people, you have not been sent to make things difficult.'" 
57 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"None of you should urinate into still water and then perform Wudu' with it." 
58 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'None of you should urinate in still water and perform Ghusl with it.'" Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: "ya'qub would not narrate this Hadith except for a Dinar."[1]  [1] Ya'qub bin Ibrahim Ad-Dawrqi, and the meaning is that he held the view that it is permissible to accept a payment for narrating, contrary to many others. 
59 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"A man asked the Prophet (ﷺ): 'O Messenger of Allah, we travel by sea and we take a little water with us, but if we use it for Wudu', we will go thirsty. Can we perform Wudu', with sea-water?' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Its water is a means of purification and its dead meat is permissible.'" 
60 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) started Salah, he would remain silent for a short while. I said: 'May my father and mother be ransomed for you, O Messenger of Allah! What do you say when you remain silent between the Takbir and the recitation (in the Salah)?' He said: 'I say: Allahumma ba'id baini was baina khatayaya kama ba'adta baina al-mashriq wal-maghrib; Allahumma naqqini min khatayaya kama yunaqqath-thawb al-abyad min ad-danas; Allahummaghsilni min khatayaya bith-thalji wal-ma'i wal-barad (O Allah, out a great distance between me and my sins, as great as the distance You have made between the East and the West; O Allah, cleanse me of of sin as a white garment is cleansed from filth; Wash away my sins with snow, water, and hail)'." 
61 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"The Prophet (ﷺ) used to say: 'Allahumaghsil khatayaya bi-ma'ith-thalj wal-barad was naqqi qalbi min al-khataya kama naqayta ath-thawb al-abyad min ad-danas (O Allah, was away my sins with the water of snow and hail, and cleanse my heart of sin as a white garment is cleansed of filth.'" 
62 | ,'Awf bin Malik said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offering the (funeral) prayer for one who had died, and I heard him say in his supplication: 'Allahummaghfir lahu warhamhu wa 'afihi was a'fu 'anhu, wa akrim nuzulahu wa wassi' ,adkhalahu waghsilhu bil-ma'i wath-thalji wal-baradi wa naqqihi min al-khataya kama ynaqqath-thawb al-abyad min ad-danas. (O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him, keep him safe and sound and forgive him, honor the place where he settles and make his entrance wide; wash him with water and snow and hail, and cleanse him of sin as a white garment is cleansed of dirt)." 
63 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"If a dog drinks from the vessel of one of you, let him wash it seven times."

66 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him throw (the contents) away and wash it seven times.'" Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: I do not know any one who followed 'Ali bin Mushir in narrating it with: "Let him throw it away." 
67 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Al-Mughaffal that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded that dogs be killed, but he made an exception for hunting dogs and sheepdogs and said:"If a dog licks a vessel then wash it seven times, and rub it the eighth time with dust." 
68 | ,It was narrated from Kabshah bint Ka'b bin Malik that Abu Qatadah entered upon her, then she narrated the following:"I poured some water from him for Wudu', and a cat came and drank from it, so he tilted the vessel for it to drink." Kabshah said: "He saw me looking at him and said: 'Are you surprised, O daughter of my brother?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are not impure, rather they are among the males and females (animals) who go around among you." 
69 | ,It was narrated that Anas said:"An announcer came to us from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'Allah and His Messenger forbid you from (eating) the flesh of domestic donkeys, for it is filth.'"

Shu'bah said: "I remember that he washed his forearms and started rubbing them, and he wiped the inside of his ear, but I do not remember whether he wiped the outside of them." 
75 | ,It was narrated that 'Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'Actions are only done with intentions, and every man shall have what he intended. Thus he whose emigration was for Allah and His Messenger, his emigration was for Allah and His Messenger, and he whose emigration was to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman in marriage, his emigration was for that which he intended." 
76 | ,It was narrated that Anas said:"I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when the time for 'Asr prayer had come. The people looked for (water for) Wudu' but they could not find any.

Then he made his camel stop and went away until he disappeared from me, then he came back and said: 'Do you have water with you?' I had a water skin with me, so I brought it out and poured it for him. He washed his hands and face and began to wash his arms, but he was wearing a Syrian Jubbah[1] that had narrow sleeves, so he brought his arms out from beneath the Jubbah and washed his hands and arms, and wiped his forelock a little and his turban a little." - Ibn 'Awn said: "I cannot remember it well - then he wiped over his Khuffs." Then he said: 'What do you need?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I do not need anything.' Then we came and 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf was leading the people in Salah, and he had led them in one Rak'ah of the Subh (Fajr) prayer. I wanted to tell him that the Prophet (ﷺ) had arrived but he did not let me, so we prayed what we had caught up with and made up what we had missed.'"  [1] It is a type of cloak.

Then he wiped his head, then he washed his right foot three times, then the left likewise. Then he said: 'I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performing Wudu' like I have just done.

One one occasion (One of the narrators) Shu'bah, indicated (that he wiped) from his forelock to the back of his head, then said:"I do not know whether he brought his hands back or not. And he washed each foot three times, then he said: 'Whoever would like to see how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) purified himself, this is how he purified himself.'"

170 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that the Prophet (ﷺ) used to kiss one of his wives then pray without performing Wudu'.

And Al-A'mash reported this Hadith from Habib bin Abi Thabit, from 'Urwah, from 'Aishah. Yahya Al-Qattan said: "This is the Hadith of Habib from 'Urwah, from 'Aishah. And the Hadith of Habib from 'Urwah, from 'Aishah: "She prays even if blood drips on the mat" is nothing.

174 | ,Ibn 'Abbas said:"Should I perform Wudu' after eating food that I see in the Book of Allah is permissible because fire has touched it?"

There was no face on the face of the Earth that was more hateful to me than your face, not now your face has become the most beloved of all faces to me.

Allah is not shy to tell the truth. Inform me: if a women sees in a dream what men see should she perform Ghusl from that?" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her: "Yes." 'Aishah said: "I expressed my displeasure and said: 'Does a woman see that?' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned to me and said: 'May your right hand be covered with dust! How else would (her child) resemble her?'" 
197 | ,It was narrated from Umm Salamah that a woman said:"O Messenger of Allah, Allah is not shy to tell the truth. Does a women have to perform Ghusl if she has a wet dream?" He said: "Yes, if she sees water."[1] Umm Salamah laughed and said: "Do women really have wet dreams?" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "How else would her child resemble her?" [1] That is, if she has an emission of the fluid of an orgasm.

201 | ,It was narrated from Fatimah bint Qais from Banu Asad Quraish that she came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned that she suffered from Istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding).

202 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"When the time of menstruation comes, stop praying, and when it goes, perform Ghusl." 
203 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Umm Habibah bint Jahsh suffered Istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) for seven years. She complained about that to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'That is not menstruation; rather that is (bleeding from) a vein, so perform Ghusl then pray.'" 
204 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Umm Habibah bint Jahsh- the wife of 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf and the sister of Zainab bint Jahsh - suffered Istihadah (non-mentrual vaginal bleeding)." She said: "She consulted the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her: 'That is not menstruation, rather that is a vein. When you period goes, perform Ghusl and pray, and when it comes, stop praying (for that period).'" 'Aishah said: "She used to perform Ghusl for every prayer and pray. Sometimes she would perform Ghusl in a washtub in the room of her sister Zainab when she was with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the water would turn red with blood, then she would go out and pray with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). That did not stop her from praying." 
205 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that Umm Habibah, an in-law of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), who was married to 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf, suffered Istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) for seven years. She consulted the Prophet (ﷺ) about that and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:'That is not menstruation, rather that is a vein, so perform Ghusl and pray.'" 
206 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Umm Habibah bint Jahsh consulted the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I suffer from Istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding).' He said: 'That is a vein, so perform Ghusl and pray.' And she used to perform Ghusl for every prayer." 
207 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that Umm Habibah asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about bleeding. 'Aishah said:"I saw her wash tub filled with blood. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her: 'Stop (praying) for as long as your period prevents you, then perform Ghusl.'" (Another chain) 
208 | ,It was narrated from Umm Salamah that a woman suffered constant bleeding at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), so Umm Salamah consulted the Prophet (ﷺ) for her. He said:"Let her count the number of nights and says that she used to menstruate each month before this happened to her, and let her stop praying for that amount of time each month. Then when that is over let her perform Ghusl, then let her use a pad, and pray." 
209 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that Umm Habibah bint Jahsh who was married to 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf suffered from Istihadah (non-mentrual vaginal bleeding) and did not become pure. Her situation was mentioned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said:'That is not menstruation, rather it is a kick [1] in the womb, so let her work out the length of the menses that she used to have, and stop praying (for that period of tie), then after that period of time), then after that let her perform Ghusl for every prayer.'"  [1] A kick in the womb: in other narrations means "A kick from Shaitan,", meaning that the Shaitan uses it to confuse her about her religious commitment. 
210 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that Umm Habibah bint Jahsh used to suffer from Istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) for seven years. She asked the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said:"That is not menstruation, rather it is a vein. Tell her not to pray for the amount of time that her period used to last, then let her perform Ghusl and pray.' She used to perform Ghusl for every prayer. 
211 | ,It was narrated from 'Urwah that Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish narrated that she came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and complained to him about bleeding. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her:"That is a vein, so when your period comes, do not pray, and when your period is over, purify yourself and pray in between one period and the next." This is evidence that Al-Aqra' is menstruation. Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said: Hisham bin 'Urwah reported this Hadith from 'Urwah, and he did not mention what Al-Mundhir mentioned in it. 
212 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: "I am a woman who suffers from Istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) and I never become pure.

213 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that a woman who suffered from Istihadah during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was told that it was a stubborn vein (i.e., one that would not stop bleeding).

214 | ,It was narrated from Jabir bin 'Abdullah, in the Hadith of Asma' bint 'Umair, when she gave birth in Dhul-Hulaifah, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Abu Bakr:"Tell her to perform Ghusl and enter Ihram." 
215 | ,It was narrated from Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish that she suffered from Istihadah and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her:"If it is menstrual blood then it is blood that is black and recognizable, so stop praying, and if it is other than that then perform Wudu', for it is just a vein." 
216 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish suffered from Istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her:"Menstrual blood is blood that is black and recognizable, so if it is like that, then stop praying, and if it is otherwise, then perform Wudu' and pray." Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said: Others reported this Hadith, and none of them mentioned what Ibn Abi 'Adi mentioned. And Allah Most High, knows best. 
217 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish suffered from Istihadah and she asked the Prophet (ﷺ): 'O Messenger of Allah, I suffer from Istihadah and I do not become pure; should I stop praying?' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'That is a vein and is not menstruation. When your period comes, stop praying, and when it goes wash the traces of blood from yourself and perform Wudu'. That is a vein and is not menstruation.'" It was said to him: "What about Ghusl?' He (ﷺ) said: "no one doubts that." Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said: "I do not know anyone who mentioned 'and perform Wudu' in this Hadith except Hammad bin Zaid, for some others have reported it from Hisham, and they did not mention 'and perform Wudu' in it." 
218 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I do not become pure. Should I stop praying? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'That is a vein and is not menstruation. When your period comes, stop praying, and when the same amount of time as your regular period has passed, then wash the blood from yourself and pray.'" 
219 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that the daughter of Abu Hubaish said:"O Messenger of Allah, I do not become pure, so should I stop praying?" He said: "No, that is a vein." Khalid said, in what I read from him, [1] "And it is not menstruation, so when your period comes, stop praying, and when it goes, wash the blood from yourself and pray." [1] Meaning, before Hisham, from whom he narrates it.

222 | ,It was narrated from Ghudaif bin Al-Harith that he asked 'Aishah in which part of the night would the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) perform Ghusl? She said:"Sometimes he performed Ghusl at the beginning of the night and sometimes he performed Ghusl at the end." I said: "Praise be to Allah Who has made the matter flexible." 
223 | ,It was narrated that Ghudaif bin Al-Harith said:"I entered upon 'Aishah and asked her: 'Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) perform Ghusl at the beginning of the night or at the end?' She said: 'Both. Sometimes he performed Ghusl at the beginning and sometimes at the end.' I said: 'Praise be to Allah who has made the matter flexible.'" 
224 | ,Abu As-Samh said:"I used to serve the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and when he wanted to perform Ghusl he said: 'Turn your back.' So I turned my back to him and concealed him." 
225 | ,It was narrated from Umm Hani' that she went to the Prophet (ﷺ) on the day of the Conquest (of Makkah) and found him performing Ghusl while Fatimah was concealing him with a garment.

226 | ,It was narrated that Musa Al-Juhani said:"A vessel was brought to Mujahid, which I estimated to be eight Ratls, and he said: 'Aishah told me that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to perform Ghusl using such a vessel.'"

We said: 'One Sa' is not enough and neither is two.' Jabir said: 'It was sufficient for one who was better than you and had more hair.'"

She said: 'Yes, if she is well-mannered.[1] I remember the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I performing Ghusl from a single wash tub. We would pour water on our hands until they were clean then pour water over them.'" Al-A'raj said: "Not mentioning the private area not paying attention to it." [1] Kaiysah:" Well-mannered when using the water with the man" (An-Nihayah) And the comments by Al-A'raj after the narration refer to its meaning. 
238 | ,It was narrated that Humaid bin 'Abdur-Rahman said:"I met a man who accompanied the Prophet (ﷺ) as Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), accompanied him for four years.

[1] It is said this is to prevent him from making his physical appearance his main aim. 
239 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"I used to perform Ghusl - the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I - from one vessel. He would compete with me and I would with him until he would say: 'Leave me some' and I would say: 'Leave me some.'"

242 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. I (said the Talbiyah) for 'Umrah and I arrived in Makkah while I was menstruating, so I did not perform Tawaf around the House nor between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. I complained about that to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he said: 'Undo your braids and comb your hair, and enter (begin the Talbiyah) for Hajj, and leave the 'Umrah.' So I did that, and then when we had completed Hajj, he sent me with 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr to At-Tan'im, and I performed 'Umrah. He said: 'This is in place of your 'Umrah.'" Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said: This Hadith is Gharib as a narration of Malik from Hisham, from 'Urwah. No one except Asshab reported it. 
243 | ,'Aishah narrated that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed Ghusl from Janabah, the vessel (of water) would be placed before him, and he would pour water over his hands before putting then into the vessel. When he had washed his hands, he would put his right hand in the vessel then pour water with his right hand and wash his private parts with his left hand.

'Ali said: 'I am a man who emits a lot of Madhi but I am too shy to ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about that because of his daughter's position with me, so let one of you ask him.' He told me that one of them - but I forgot who - asked him, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'That is Madhi. If any one of you notices that, let him wash it off himself and perform Wudu' as for prayer or similar to the Wudu' of prayer.'" 
436 | ,It was narrated that 'Ali, may Allah be please with him, said:"I was a man who emotted a great deal of Madhi. I told a man to ask the Prophet (ﷺ) (about that) and he said: 'Wudu' (is required) for that." 
437 | ,It was narrated that 'Ali said:"I felt too shy to ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about Madhi because of Fatimah, so I told Al-Miqdad to ask him, and he said: 'Wudu' (is required) for that.'" 
438 | ,'Ali said:"I sent Al-Miqdad to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to ask him about Madhi, and he said: 'Perform Wudu' and sprinkle water over your private part.'" Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said: Makhramah (one of the narrators) did not hear anything from his father. 
439 | ,It was narrated that Sulaiman bin Yasar said:"Ali bin Abi Talib sent Al-Miqdad to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to ask him about a man who notices Madhi. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Let him wash his penis then perform Wudu'.'" 
440 | ,It was narrated from Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad thatt 'Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon him, told him to ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about a man who gets close to a woman and Madhi comes out of him. (He said:) "For his daughter is (married) to me and I feel too shy to ask him." So he asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about that and he said: "If any one of you notices that let him sprinkle water on his private parts and perform Wudu' as for prayer." 
441 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'When any one of you gets up after (sleeping) at night, let him not put his hand into the vessel until he has poured water on it two or three times, for none of you knows where his hand spent the night.'" 
442 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"I prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ) one night, and I stood on his left, but he made me stand on his right, and he prayed. Then he reclined on his side and took a nap, then the Mu'adhdhin came to him and he prayed, and did not perform Wudu'." 
443 | ,It was narrated from Anas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"If anyone of you feels drowsy during his Salah, let him go and take a nap." 
444 | ,It was narrated that Busrah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever touches his private part, let him perform Wudu'.'" 
445 | ,It was narrated from Busrah bint Safwan that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"If any one of you touches his private part with his hand, let him perform Wudu'." 
446 | ,It was narrated that Marwan bin Al-Hakam said that one should perform Wudu' after touching one's penis. Marwan said:"Busrah bint Safwan told me that." 'Urwah sent someone to check that, and she said: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned what Wudu' is done for, and said: 'Touching the penis.'" 
447 | ,It was narrated from Busrah bin Safwan that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Whoever touches his penis, he should not perform Salah until he performs Wudu'." Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: Hisham bin 'Urwah did not hear this Hadith from his father. 

448 | It was narrated from Anas bin Malik, from Malik bin Sa'sa'ah, that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"While I was at the Ka'bah, in a state between sleep and wakefulness, three men came, and one of them who was in the middle came toward me. I was brought a basin of gold, filled with wisdom and faith, and he slit open from the throat to the lower abdomen, and washed the heart with Zamzam water, then - "it was filled with wisdom and faith. Then I was brought a riding-beast, smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey. I set off with Jibril, peace be upon him, and we came to the lowest heaven. It was said: 'Who is with you?' He said: 'Muhammad.' It was said: 'Has (revelation) been sent to him? Welcome to him, what an excellent visit his is.' I came to Adam, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent son and Prophet.' Then we came to the second heaven and it was said: 'Who is this?' He said: 'Jibra'il.' [1] It was said: 'Who is with you?' he said: 'Muhammad.' And the same exchange took place. I came to Yahya and 'Eisa, peace be upon them both, and greeted them, and they said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' Then we came to the third heaven and it was said: 'Who is this?' He said: 'Jibra'il.' It was said: 'Who is with you?' He said: 'Muhammad.' And the same exchange took place. I came to Yusuf, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' Then we came to the fourth heaven and the same exchange took place. I came to Idris, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' Then we came to the fifth heaven and the same exchange took place. I came to Harun, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' Then we came to the sixth heaven and the same exchange took place. I came to Musa, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' What I passed him, he wept, and it was said: 'Why are you weeping?' He said: 'O Lord, this young man whom You have sent after me, more of his Ummah will enter Paradise than from my nation, and they will be more virtuous than them.' Then we came to the seventh heaven and a similar exchange took place. I came to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent son and Prophet.' Then I was taken up to the Oft-Frequented House (Al-Bait al-Ma'mur) and I asked Jibra'il about it, and he said: 'This is Al-Bait al-Ma'mur in which seventy thousand angels pray everyday, and when they leave it they never come back.' Then I was taken up to Sidrah Al-Muntaha (the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary). Its fruits were like Qilal [2] of Hajar and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. At its base were four rivers: Two hidden rivers and two manifest rivers. I asked Jibril (About them) and he said: 'The two hidden ones are in paradise, and the two manifest ones are the Euphrates and the Nile.' Then fifty prayers were enjoined upon me. I came to Musa and he said: 'What happened?' I said: 'Fifty prayers have been enjoined upon me.' He said: 'I know more about the people than you. I tried hard with the Children of Israel. Your Ummah will never be able to bear that. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce it for you.' So I went back to my Lord and asked Him to reduce it, and He made it forty. Then I went back to Musa, peace be upon him, and he said: 'What happened?' I said: 'He made it forty.' He said to me something similar to what he said the first time, so I went back to my Lord and He made it thirty. I came to Musa, peace be upon him, and told him, and he said to me something similar to what he said the first time, so I went back to my Lord and he made it twenty, then ten, then five. I came to Musa, peace be upon him, and he said to me something like he had said the first time, but I said: 'I feel too shy before my Lord to go back to Him.' Then it was called out: 'I have decreed (the reward for) My obligation, and I have reduced the burden for My slaves and I will give a ten-fold reward for each good deed.'"  [1] It is like this here, while it is Jibra'il the first time it appears in this narration, and Jibra'il is often used in the Hadith literature.  [2] Plural of Qullah 
449 | ,Anas bin Malik and Ibn Hazm said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, enjoined fifty prayers upon my Ummah, and I came back with that until I passed by Musa, peace be upon him, who said: 'What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah?' I said: 'He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.' Musa said to me: 'Go back to your Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, for your Ummah will not be able to do that.' So I went back to my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, and He reduced a portion of it. Then I came back to Musa and told him, and he said: 'Go back to you Lord, for your Ummah will not be able to do that.' So I went back to my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, and He said: 'They are five (prayers) but they are fifty (in reward), and the Word that comes from Me cannot be changed.' [1] I came back to Musa and he said: 'Go back to your Lord.' I said: 'I feel too shy before my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime.'"  [1]See Surah Qaf 50:29. 
450 | ,Anas bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"I was brought an animal that was larger than a donkey and smaller than a mule, whose stride could reach as far as it could see. I mounted it, and Jibril was with me, and I set off. Then he said: 'Dismount and pray,' so I did that. He said: 'Do you know where you have prayed? You have prayed in Taibah, which will be the place of the emigration.' Then he said: 'Dismount and pray,' so I prayed. He said: 'Do you know where you have prayed? You have prayed in Mount Sinai, where Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, spoke to Musa, peace be upon him.' So I dismounted and prayed, and he said: 'Do you know where you have prayed? You have prayed in Bethlehem, where 'Eisa, peace be upon him, was born.' Then I entered Bait Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) where the Prophets, peace be upon them, were assembled for me, and Jibril brought me forward to lead them in prayer. Then I was taken up to the first heaven, where I saw Adam, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the second heaven where I saw the maternal cousins 'Eisa and Yahya, peace be upon them. Then I was taken up to the third heaven where I saw Yusuf, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the fourth heaven where I saw Harun, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the fifth heaven where I saw Idris, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the sixth heaven where I saw Musa, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven where I saw Ibrahim, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up above seven heavens and we came to Sidrah Al-Muntaha and I was covered with fog. I fell down prostrate and it was said to me: '(Indeed) The day I created the heavens and the Earth, I enjoined upon you and your Ummah fifty prayers, so establish them, you and your Ummah.' I came back to Ibrahim and he did not ask me about anything, then I came to Musa and he said: 'How much did your Lord enjoin upon you and your Ummah?' I said: 'Fifty prayers.' He said: 'You will not be able to establish them, neither you nor your Ummah. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce it.' So I went back to my Lord and He reduced it by ten. Then I came to Musa and he told me to go back, so I went back and He reduced it by ten. Then I came to Musa and he told me to go back, so I went back and He reduced it by ten. Then it was reduced it by ten. Then it was reduced to five prayers. He (Musa) said: 'Go back to you Lord and ask Him to reduce it, for two prayers were enjoined upon the Children of Israel but they did not establish them.' So I went back to my Lord and asked Him to reduce it, but He said: 'The day I created the heavens and the Earth, I enjoined fifty prayers upon you and your Ummah. Five is for fifty, so establish them, you and your Ummah.' I knew that this was what Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, had determined so I went back to Musa, peace be upon him, and he said: 'Go back.' But I knew that it was what Allah had determined, so I did not go back." 
451 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah said:"When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was taken on the Night Journey, he came to Sidrah Al-Muntaha, which is in the sixth heaven. That is where everything that comes up from below ends, and where everything that comes down from above, until it is taken from it. Allah says: When what covered the lote-tree did cover it! [1] He said: "It was moths of gold. And I was given three things: The five daily prayers, the last verses of Surah Al-Baqarah, and whoever of my Ummah dies without associating anything with Allah will be forgiven for Al-Muqhimat." [2]  [1] An-Najm 53:16. [2] "The sins of the worst magnitude that drag one into the Fire." (An-Nihayah) 
452 | ,It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the prayers were enjoined in Makkah, and that two angels came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and took him to Zamzam, where they split open his stomach and took out his innards in a basin of gold, and washed them with Zamzam water, then they filled his heart with wisdom and knowledge. 
453 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"The first time the Salah was enjoined it was two Rak'ahs, and it remained as such when traveling, but the Salah while resident was made complete." 
454 | ,Abu 'Amr - meaning, Al-Awza'i - said that he asked Az-Zuhri about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in Makkah before the Hijrah to Al-Madinah. He said:"Urwah told me that 'Aishah said: 'Allah enjoined the salah upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the first thing that He enjoined was two Rak'ahs at a time, then it was made complete four Rak'ahs while in the state of residence but the prayer when traveling remained two Rak'ahs, as it was first enjoined.'" 
455 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"The Salah was enjoined two Rak'ahs at a time, then the Salah when traveling remained like that, but the Salah while resident was increased." 
456 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"The Salah was enjoined on the lips of the Prophet (ﷺ), four Rak'ahs while resident, and two while traveling, and one Rak'ah during times of fear." 
457 | ,It was narrated that Umayyah bin 'Abdullah bin Khalid bin Asid said to Ibn 'Umar:"How can the Salah be shortened as Allah says: There is no sin on you if you shorten As-Salah (the prayer) if you are in fear?" [1] Ibn 'Umar said: "O son of my brother! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us when we had gone astray and he taught us. One of the things that he taught us was that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has commanded us to pray two Rak'ahs when traveling."  [1] An-Nisa' 4:101. 
458 | ,It was narrated from Abu Suhail, from his fatehr, that he heard Talhah bin 'Ubaidullah say:"A man from the people of Najd came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with unkempt hair. We could hear him talking loudly but we could not understand what he was saying until he came closer. He was asking about Islam. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: 'Five prayers each day and night.' He said: 'Do I have to do anything else' He said: 'No, unless you do it voluntarily.' He said: 'And fasting the month of Ramadan.' He said: 'Do I have to do anything else?' He said: 'No, unless you do it voluntarily.' And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned Zakah to him, and he said: 'Do I have to do anything else?' He said: 'No, unless you do it voluntarily.' The man left saying: 'By Allah, I will not do any more than this or any less.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'He will achieve salvation, if he is speaking the truth.'" 
459 | ,It was narrated that Anas said:"A man asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): 'O Messenger of Allah, how many prayers has Allah enjoined upon His slaves?' He said: 'Allah has enjoined upon His slaves (five) prayers.' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, is there anything before them or after them?' He said: 'Allah has enjoined upon His salves (five) prayers.' The man swore that he would not do anything more or less than that. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'If he is speaking the truth he will most certainly enter Paradise.'" 
460 | ,'Awf bin Malik Al-Ashja'i said:"We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: 'Will you not pledge to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?' And he repeated it three times. So we stretched forth our hands to give our pledge. We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, we are willing to give you our pledge, but on what?' He said: 'That you will worship Allah and not associate anything with him, and (offer) the five daily prayers.' And he said, very quietly: 'And you will not ask the people for anything.'" 
461 | ,It was narrated from Ibn Muhairiz that a man from Banu Kinanah who was called Al-Mukhdaji heard a man in Ash-Sham, who was known as Abu Muhammad, saying that Witr was obligatory. Al-Mukhdaji said:"In the morning I went to 'Ubadah bin As-Samit, and I met him while he was on his way to the Masjid. I told him what Abu Muhammad said, and 'Ubadah said: 'Abu Muhammad is wrong. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'Five prayers are those that Allah has decreed for (His) slaves, whoever does them, and does not neglect any of them out of disregard toward them, will have a promise from Allah that He will admit him to Paradise. And whoever does not to them will have no such promise from Allah; if He wills he will punish him and if He wills He will admit him to Paradise. 
462 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Do you think that is there was a river by the door of any one of you, and he bathed in it five times each day, would there be any trace of dirt left on him?"

Then I sat with Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: 'I prayed to Allah to help me find a righteous companion.' So tell me a Hadith that you heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), so that Allah might benefit me from it. He said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: "The first thing for which a person will be brought to account will be his Salah. If it is sound then he will have succeeded, be salvaged, but if it is not then he will have lost and be doomed." - (One of the narrators) Hammam said: "I do not know whether this was the words of Qatadah or part of the report." - "If anything is lacking from his obligatory prayers, He will say: 'Look and see whether My slave has any voluntary prayers to make up for what is deficient from his obligatory prayers.' Then all of his deeds will be dealt with in like manner." 
466 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"The first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his Salah. If it is found to be complete then it will be recorded as complete, and if anything is lacking He will say: 'Look and see if you can find any voluntary prayers with which to complete what he neglected of his obligatory prayers.' Then the rest of his deeds will be reckoned in like manner." 
467 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"The first thing for which a person will be brought to account will be his Salah. If it is complete (all well and good), otherwise Allah will say: 'Look and see if My slave did any voluntary prayer.'

468 | ,It was narrated from Abu Ayyub that a man said:"O Messenger of Allah, tell me of a deed that will gain me admittance to Paradise." The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him, establish the Salah, pay the Zakah and uphold the ties of kinship. Let go!" - as if he was riding his camel.

He said: 'He used to pray Zauhr when the sun had passed its zenith, and (he would pray) 'Asr and a man could walk to the farthest point in Al-Madinah and the sun would still be clear and hot. And Maghrib, I do not know the time he mentioned.' After that I met him and asked him, and he said: 'He used to pray Fajr then after the prayer a man could regarding it, sitting next to him, look at the face of someone he knew and he could recognize it.' He said: 'And he used to recite in it between sixty and one hundred (verses).'" 
496 | ,It was narrated from Az-Zuhri he said:"Anas told me that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out when the sun had passed its zenith, and led them in Zuhr prayer." 
497 | ,It was narrated that Khabbab said:"We complained to the Messenger of Alalh (ﷺ) about how hot the sand was, but he did not respond to our complaint." It was said to Abu Ishaq (one of the narrators): "Did they complain regarding his praying it early?" He said: "Yes." 
498 | ,Hamzah Al-'A'idhi said:"I heard Anas bin Malik say: 'When the Prophet (ﷺ) halted, he would not move on until he had prayed Zuhr.' A man said: 'Even if it was the middle of the day?' He said: 'Even if it was the middle of the day.'" 
499 | ,Khalid bin Dinar Abu Khaldah said:"I heard Anas bin Malik say: 'When it was hot, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would wait until it cooled down to pray, and when it was cold he would hasten to pray.'" 
500 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'If it is very hot, wait until it cools down before you pray, for intense heat is a breeze from Hell.'" 
501 | ,It was narrated from Abu Musa in a Marfu' [1] report:"Wait until it cools down to pray Zuhr, for the heat you experience is a breeze from Hell."  [1] Meaning he attributed it to the Prophet (ﷺ). 
502 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is 'Jibril, peace be upon you, he came to teach you your religion. He prayed Subh when the dawn appeared, and he prayed Zuhr when the sun had (passed its zenith), and he prayed 'Asr when he saw that the shadow of a thing was equal to its height, then he prayed Maghrib when the sub had set and it is permissible for the fasting person to eat. Then he prayed 'Isha' when the twilight had disappeared. Then he came to him the following day and prayed Subh when it had got a little lighter, then he prayed Zuhr when the shadow of a thing was equal to its height, then he prayed 'Asr when the shadow of a thing was equal to twice its height, then he prayed Maghrib at the same time as before, then he prayed 'Isha' when a short period of the night had passed. Then he said: 'The prayer is between the times when you prayed yesterday and the times when you prayed today.'" 
503 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said:"The Prophet (ﷺ) prayed Zuhr when the length of (a person's shadow) was between three and five feet in summer, and between five and seven feet in winter." 
504 | ,It was narrated that Jabir said:"A man asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the times of prayer. He said: 'Pray with me.' So he prayed Zuhr when the sun had passsed its zenith, 'Asr when the shadow of a thing was equal to its height, Maghrib when the sun had set and 'Isha' when the twilight had disappeared." He said: "Then he prayed Zuhr when the shadow of a man was equal in length to his height, 'Asr when the length of a man's shadow was twice his height, and Maghrib just before the twilight disappeared." (One of the narrators) 'Abdullah bin Al-Harith said: "then he said: 'With regard to 'Isha' I think it is up to one-third of the night.'" [1]  [1] The speaker there is Thawr, who narrated it from 'Ata' from Jabir. 
505 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed 'Asr when the sun was in her room and the shadow had not appeared on her wall. 
506 | ,It was narrated from Anas:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray 'Asr, then a person could go to Quba'." One of them [1] said: "And he would come to them when they were prayed." The other said: "And the sub was still high."  [1] Both Az-Zuhri and Ishaq bin 'Abdullah narrated it from Anas, so the reference is about them. 
507 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray 'Asr when the sun was still high and bright, and a person could go to Al-'Awali [1] when the sun was still high."  [1] Al-'Awali is the southern most district of Al-Madinah, and it is very big. Its nearest limit is at a distance of about two miles from the center of Al-Madinah. While its furthest limit is about eight miles. 
508 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to lead us in 'Asr prayer when the sun was still bright and high." 
509 | ,It was narrated that Abu Bakr bin 'Uthman bin Sahl bin Hunaif said:"I heard Abu Umamah bin Sahl say: 'We prayed Zuhr with 'Umar bin 'Abdul-'Aziz, then we went out and entered upon Anas bin Malik, and we found him praying 'Asr.'" I said: "O uncle, what is this prayer that you prayed?" He said: "'Asr; this is the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that we used to pray with him." 
510 | ,It was narrated that Abu Salamah said:"We prayed at the time of 'Umar bin 'Abdul-'Aziz, then we went to Anas bin Malik and found him praying. when he finished he said to us: 'Have you prayed?' We said: 'We prayed Zuhr.' He said: 'I prayed 'Asr.' They said: 'You have prayed early.' He said: 'Rather I prayed as I saw my companions pray.'" 
511 | ,Al-'Ala' narrated to us that he entered upon Anas bin Malik in his house in Al-Basrah, when he had finished Zuhr, and his house was beside the Masjid. "When we entered upon him, he said:'Have you prayed 'Asr?' We said: 'No, we have just finished Zuhr.' He said: 'Pray 'Asr.' So we got up and prayed, and when we finished he said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: "That is the prayer of the hypocrite: he sits and delays 'Asr prayer until (the sun) is between the horns of the Shaitan, then he gets up and pecks four (Rak'ahs) in which he only remembers Allah a little.'" 
6 | ,It was narrated from Salim, from his father, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"The one who misses 'Asr prayer, it is as if he has been robbed of his family and his wealth."  It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "The one who misses 'Asr prayer, it is as if he has been robbed of his family and his wealth." 
513 | ,It was narrated from Jabir bin 'Abdullah that Jibril came to the Prophet (ﷺ) to teach him the times of prayer. Jibril went forward, with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) behind him and the people behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he prayed Zurh when the sun had passed its zenith. Then he came to him when the shadow of a person was equal to his height, and did as he had done before; Jibril went forward, with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) behind him and the people behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he prayed 'Asr. Then Jibril came to him when the sun had set; Jibril went forward, with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) behind him and the people behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he prayed Al-Ghadah. [1] Then he came to him on the second day when a man's shadow was equal to his height, and did as he had done the day before, he prayed Zuhr. Then he came to him when the shadow of a man was twice his height, and did what he had done the day before, and prayed 'Asr. Then he came to him when the sun had set and did what he had done the day before, and prayed Maghrib. Then we slept and got up, and slept and got up again. Then he came to him and did what he had done the day before and prayed 'Isha.' The  he came to him when the (the light of) dawn was spread (on the horizon) [2] and the starts were still clear in the sky, and he did the same as he had done the day before, and prayed Al-Ghadah. Then he said:' The time between these two is the time for prayer.'"  [1] Meaning Fajr, the morning prayer. [2] The Fajr prayer was elongated because the Prophet recited at length during the prayer, so that it ended just before sunrise. That defined the end of the time for Fajr, as the beginning of the time was defined by the  moment when he started the first Rak'ah. 
514 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Whoever catches up with two Rak'ahs of 'Asr prayer before the sun sets, or one Rak'ah of the Subh prayer before the sun rises, has caught it." 
515 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Whoever catches up with one Rak'ah of 'Asr prayer before the sun sets, or catches up with one Rak'ah of Fajr before the sun rises, has caught it." 
516 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"If any one of you catches the first prostration of 'Asr prayer before the sun sets, let him complete his prayer, and if he catches up with the first prostration of Fajr prayer before the sub rises, let him complete his prayer." 
517 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Whoever catches up with a Rak'ah of the Subh prayer before the sun rises, then he has caught up with Subh, and whoever catches up with a Rak'ah of 'Asr prayer before the sun sets, then he has caught up with 'Asr." 
518 | ,It was narrated from Nasr bin 'Abdur-Rahman, from his grandfather Mu'adh, that he performed Tawaf with Mu'adh bin 'Afra' but he did not pray. "I said:'Are you not going to pray?' He said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'There is no prayer after 'Asr until the sun has set, nor after Subh until the sun has risen.'" 
519 | ,It was narrated from Sulaiman bin Buraidah that his father said:"A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him about the times of prayer. He said: 'Stay with us for these two days.' Then he told Bilal to say the Iqamah at dawn and he prayed Fajr. Then he told him to do that when the sun had passed its zenith and he prayed Zuhr. Then he told him to do that when the sun was still bright, and he said the Iqamah for 'Asr. Then he told him to do that when the last part of the sun had dissapeared, and he said the Iqamah for Maghrib. Then he told him to do that when the twilight had disappeared and he said the Iqamah for 'Isha'. The following day, he prayed Fajr when there was light, then he delayed Zuhr until it was cooler, and waited until it was much cooler before praying 'Asr but the sun was still clear, so he prayed 'Asr later than on the first day. Then he prayed Maghrib before the twilight disappeared. Then he told him to say the Iqamah for 'Isha' when one-third of the night had passed, and he prayed, then he said: 'Where is the one who was asking about the times of prayer? The times of your prayer are between the times you have seen.'" 
520 | ,It was narrated from a man of Aslam, who was one of the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), that they used to pray Maghrib with the Prophet (ﷺ),then they would go back to their families in the furthest part of Al-Madinah, shooting arrows and seeing where they landed. [1]  [1] Because it was still bright enough. 
521 | ,It was narrated that Abu Basrah Al-Ghifari said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in praying 'Asr in Al-Mukhammas. He said: 'This prayer was enjoined upon those who came before you, but they neglected it. Whoever prays it regularly will have a two-fold reward, and there is no prayer after it until the Shahid appears." And the Shahid is "the star." [1]  [1] This is a statement of one of the narrators, and Allah knows best. 
522 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Amr - and (one of the narrators) Shu'bah said:"Sometimes he (Qatadah, his teacher) narrated it as a Marfu' report and sometimes he did not" - "The time for Zuhr prayer is until 'Asr comes, and the time for 'Asr prayer is until the sun turns yellow. the time for Maghrib is until the twilight disappears, and the time for 'Isha' is until the night is halfway through, and the time for Subh is until the sun rises." 
523 | ,Abu Bakr bin Abi Musa narrated that his father said:"A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) asking him about the times of prayer, and he did not answer him. He told Bilal to say the Iqamah at dawn broke, then he told him to say the Iqamah for Zuhr when the sun had passed its zenith and a person would say: 'It is the middle of the day,' but he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) knew better. Then he told him to say the Iqamah for 'Asr when the sun was still high. Then he told him to say the Iqamah for Maghrib when the sun had set. Then he told him to say the Iqamah for 'Isha' when the twilight had dissapeared. Then the next day he told him to say the Iqamah for Fajr, at a time such that when after he had finished one would say: 'The sun has risen.' Then he delayed Zuhr until it was nearly the time of 'Asr compared to the day before. Then he delayed 'Asr, to a time such that when he finished one would say: 'The su has turned red.' Then he delayed Maghrib until the twilight was about to disappear. Then he delayed 'Isha' until one-third of the night had passed. Then he said: 'The time (for prayer) is between these times.'" 
524 | ,Al-Husain bin Bashir bin Sallam narrated that his father said:"Muhammad bin 'Ali and I entered upon Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari. We said to him: 'Tell us about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' That was at the time of Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf. He said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out and prayed Zuhr when the sun had passed its zenith and the shadow (of a thing) was the length of a sandal-strap. Then he prayed 'Asr when the shadow of a man was the length of a sandal-strap plus his height. Then he prayed Maghrib when the sun had set. Then he prayed 'Isha' when the twilight disappeared. Then he prayed Fajr when dawn broke. The next day he prayed Zuhr when a man's shadow was equal to his height. Then he prayed 'Asr when a man's shadow was twice his height, and (the time between the prayer and sunset) lasted as long as it takes a swift rider to reach Dhul-Hulaifah. Then he prayed Maghrib when the sun set, then he prayed 'Isha' when one-third or one-half of the night had passed'" - (One of the narrators) Zaid, was not sure - "then he prayed Fajr when it had become bright." 
525 | ,Sayyar bin Salamah said:"I entered upon Abu Barzah, and my fatehr asked him: 'How did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pray the prescribed prayers?' He said: 'He used to pray Zuhr, which you call Al-Uula (the first) when the sun passed its zenith; he used to pray 'Asr when one of us could go back to his hoome in the farthest part of Al-Madinah while the sun was still bright.' I forgot what he said about Maghrib. 'And he used to like to delay 'Isha', which you call Al-'Atamah, and he did not like to sleep before it nor talk after it. And he used to finish the Al-Ghadah (Fajr) prayer when a man could recognize his neighbor, and he used to recite (in it) between sixty and one hundred verses.'" 
526 | ,Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:"Jibril, peace be upon him, came to the Prophet (ﷺ) when the sun had passed its zenith and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray Zuhr when the sun has passed its zenith.' Then he waited until a man's shadow was equal to his height. Then he came to him for 'Asr and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray 'Asr.' Then he waited until the sunset, then he came to him and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray Maghrib.' So he got up and prayed it when the sun had set. Then he waited until the twilight disappeared, then he came to him and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray 'Isha'.' So he got up and prayed it. Then he came to him when dawn broke and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray.' So he got up and prayed Subh.' So he got up and prayed Subh. Then he came to him the next day when a man's shadow was equal to his height, and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray.' So he prayed Zuhr. Then Jibril came to him when a man's shadow was equal to twice his length and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray.' So he prayed 'Asr. Then he came to him for Maghrib when the sun set, at exactly the same time as the day before, and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray.' So he prayed Maghrib. Then he came to him for 'Isha' when the first third of the night had passed, and said: 'Get up and pray.' So he prayed 'Isha'. Then he came to him for Subh when it had become very bright, and said: 'Get up and pray.' So he prayed Subh. Then he said: 'The times of prayer one between those two (limits).'" 
527 | ,It was narrated that Muhammad bin 'Amr bin Hasan said:"Al-Hajjaj arrived, and we asked Jabir bin 'Abdullah, who said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed Zuhr at the time of intense heat, [1] and 'Asr when the sun was white and clear, and Maghrib when the sun set, and with 'Isha' it would depend - if he saw that the people had gathered, he would pray early, and if he saw that they had not come yet, he would delay it.'"  [1] Meaning, at the earliest time. 
528 | ,It was narrated that An-Nu'man bin Bashir said:"I am the most knowledgeable of people about the time of the 'Isha' prayer. The Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray it when the moon set on the third night of the month." 
529 | ,It was narrated that An-Nu'man bin Bashir said:"By Allah, I am the most knowledgeable of people about the time of the 'Isha' prayers. The Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray it when the moon set on the third night of the month." 
530 | ,Sayyar bin Salamah said:"My father and I entered upon Abu Barzah, and my father said to him: 'How did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pray the prescribed prayers?' He said: He used to pray Zuhr, which you call Al-Uala (the first) when the sun passed its zenith; he used to pray 'Asr then one of us could go back to his home in the farthest part of Al-Madinah when the sun was still bright.'" - He said: "I forgot what he said to me about Maghrib." - "And he used to like to delay 'Isha', which you call Al-'Atamah, and he did not like to sleep before it nor speak after it. And he used to finish the Al-Ghadah (Fajr) prayer when a man could recognize his neighbor, and he used to recite between sixty and one hundred verses.'" 
531 | ,It was narrated that Ibn Juraij said:"I said to 'Ata': 'What is the best time you think I should pray Al-'Atamah, either in congregation or on my own?' He said: 'I heard Ibn 'Abbas say: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) delayed Al-'Atamah one night until the people had slept and woken up, then slept and woken up again. Then 'Umar got up and said: 'The prayer, the prayer!'" 'Ata' said: 'Ibn 'Abbas said: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out, and it is as if I can see him now, with water dripping from his head, putting his hand on the side of his head. [He said: "And he indicated (how)"].'" I checked with 'Ata' how the Prophet (ﷺ) put his hand on his head, and he showed me the same way as Ibn 'Abbas had done. 'Ata' spread his fingers a little, then placed them with the tips of his fingers on his forehead, then he drew his fingers together on his head until his thumb touched the edge of the ear that is next to the face, then moved it to his temple and forehead, then he said: 'Were it not that I would impose too much difficulty for my Ummah, I would have commanded them to offer this prayer only at this time.'" 
532 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"The Prophet (ﷺ) delayed 'Isha' one night until part of the night had passed. Then 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, got up and called out: 'The prayer, O Messenger of Allah! The women and children have gone to sleep.' Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out with water dripping from his head, saying: 'This is (the best) time (for 'Isha'), were it not that this would be too difficult for my Ummah.'" 
533 | ,It was narrated that Jabir bin Samurah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to delay the later 'Isha'."[1]  [1] It is described as the later 'Isha' prayer because the Maghrib prayer is sometimes called 'Isha' prayer, but it is the first 'Isha'. Some scholars are of the opinion that it is disliked to call Maghrib 'Isha' without qualifying it as the first 'Isha'. See Fath Al-Bari. 
534 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Were it not that I would impose too much difficulty on my Ummah, I would have commanded them to delay 'Isha' and to use the Siwak for every prayer." 
535 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) delayed A;-'Atamah one night, and 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, called out to him: 'The women and children have gone to sleep.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out and said: 'No one is waiting for it except you.' At that time no prayer was offered except in Al-Madinah. Then he said: 'Pray it between the time when the twilight disappears and when one-third of the night has passed.'" 
536 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah the Mother of the Believers said:"The Prophet (ﷺ) delayed the prayer one night until most of the night had passed and the people in the Masjid had gone home to sleep, then he went out and prayed, and said: 'This is indeed its (prayer) time, were it not that I would impose too much difficulty on my Ummah.'" 
537 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Umar said:"We stayed in the Masjid one night waiting for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to pray 'Isha'. He came out to us when one-third of the night or more had passed, and he said when he came out: 'You are waiting for a prayer for which the followers of no other religion are waiting. Were it not that I would impose too much difficulty on my Ummah, I would have led them in prayer at this time.' Then he commanded the Mu'adhdhin to say the Iqamah and he prayed." 
538 | ,It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in Maghrib prayer, then he did not come out to us until half the night had passed. Then he came out and led them in prayer, then he said: 'The people have prayed and gone to sleep, but you are still in a state of prayer so long as you are waiting for the prayer. Were it not for the weakness of the weak and, the sickness of the sick, I would have commanded that this prayer be delayed until halfway through the night.'" 
539 | ,Humaid said:"Anas was asked: 'Did the Prophet (ﷺ) use a ring?' He said: 'Yes. One night he delayed the later 'Isha' prayer, until almost halfway through the night. When he prayed the Prophet (ﷺ) turned his face toward us and said: 'You are still in a state of prayer so long as you waiting for it.'" Anas said: 'It is as if I can see the luster of his ring.' According to the narration of 'Ali - that is, Ibn Hujr - "until halfway through the night." 
540 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"If the people knew what (virtue) there was in the call to prayer and the first row, and they not find any way to get to do that [1] other than by drawing lots, they would do that. If they knew what (virtue) there was in coming early to prayer, they would compete to be first in the Masjid. If they knew what (virtue) there was in Al-'Atamah and Subh, they would come to them even if they had to crawl."  [1] Indicating the two mentioned items: that is the call to prayer and praying in the first row. 
541 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Umar said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Do not let the Bedouin make you change the name of this prayer of yours, for they delay the prayer until it is very dark because of their preoccupation with camels and milking them. Verily, it is 'Isha'.'" 
542 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Umar said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say on the Minbar: 'Do not let the Bedouin make you change the name of your prayer; verily, it is 'Isha'.'" 
543 | ,Ja'far bin Muhammad bin 'Ali bin Al-Husain narrated from his father, that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed Subh as soon as he was certain the dawn had appeared." 
544 | ,Humaid narrated from Ans that a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked him about the time of the Subh prayer. The following morning he commanded that the Iqamah for prayer be said when dawn broke, and he led us in prayer. The next day when there was light he commanded that the Iqamah for prayer be said and he led us in prayer. Then he said:"Where is the one who was asking about the time for prayer? (It is) between these two times." 
545 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has prayed Subh, the women would depart, wrapped in their wrappers, unrecognizable because of the darkness." 
546 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"The women used to pray Subh with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), wrapped in their wrappers, then they would return, and no one would recognize them because of the darkness." 
547 | ,It was narrated that Anas said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed Fajr on the day of Khaibar during the time it was still dark, when he was near the enemy. Then he attacked them and said: 'Allahu Akbar! Khaibar is destroyed!' Twice. 'Then, when it descends in their courtyard, evil will be the morning for those who had been warned!'"

557 | ,It was narrated from Salim, from his father, that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Whoever catches up with with a Rak'ah of Jumu'ah or any other (prayer), his prayer is complete." 
558 | ,It was narrated from Salim that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Whoever catches up with a Rak'ah of one of the prayers has caught up with it, except that he has to make up the portion that he missed." 
559 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah As-Sunabihi that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"The sun rises and with it the horn of the Shaitan, then when it is fully risen, he goes away. Then when it approaches the meridian he comes near to it, and when it has passed the zenith he goes away. Then when it is close to setting, he comes near to it, then when it has set, he goes away." And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade praying at those times. 
560 | ,It was narrated that Musa bin 'Ali bin Rabah said:"I heard my father say: 'I heard 'Uqbah bin 'Amir Al-Juhani say: There are three times during which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade us to pray in or bury our dead: When the sun has clearly stated to rise, until it is fully risen; when it is directly overhead at noon, until it has passed its zenith; and when it is close to setting, until it has fully set.'"

"'He told me that Abu Mahdhurah said to him, I went out with a group of people and we were somewhere on the road to Hunain when the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) was coming back from Hunain. The Messenger of Allah met us somewhere on the road and the Muadhdhin of the Messenger of Allah called the Adhan for prayer in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W). We heard the voice of the Muadh'dhin and we were careless about it (the Adhan), so we started yelling, immitating and mocking it. The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) heard us, so he sent some people who brought us to stand in front of him. He said, 'Who is the one whose voice I heard so loud?' The people all pointed to me, and they were telling the truth. He sent them all away, but kept me there and said to me: 'Stand up and call the Adhan for the Prayer.' I stood up and the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) taught me the Adhan himself. He Said, 'Say:  'Allahu Akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar; Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah; Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah (Allah is the Greatest,Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger Allah,I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger Allah).'

Then he called me when I had finished saying the Adhan, and he gave me a bundle in which there was some silver. I said: 'O Messenger of Allah (S.A.W), let me be the one doing the Adhan in Makkah.' He said: 'I command you to do so.' Then I came to 'Attab bin Asid who was the governor of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) in Makkah, and I called the Adhan for prayer with him upon the orders of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W)." 
633 | ,It was narrated that Abu Mahdhurah said:"When the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) left Hunain, I was the tenth of a group of ten of the people of Makkah who were trying to catch up with them. We heard them calling the Adhan for the prayer and we started to repeat the Adhan, mocking them. The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said, 'I heard among these people the Adhan of one who has a beautiful voice.' He sent for us, and we recited the Adhan one by one, and I was the last of them. When I said the Adhan, he said: 'Come here.' He sat me down in front of him and rubbed my forelock and blessed me three times, then he said, 'Go and give the Adhan at the sacred House.' I said: 'How, O Messenger of Allah?' He taught me as you say the Adhan now: 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar; Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah; Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah; Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah; Hayya 'alas-salah, Hayya 'ala-salah; Hayya 'alal-falah Hayya 'alal-falah; as-salatu khairun min an-nawm;as-salatu khairun min an-nawm; (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger Allah; I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; Come to prayer, come to prayer; come to prosperity, come to prosperity; prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep)' - in the first (Adhan) for As-Subh (Fajr). And he taught me the Iqamah saying each phrase twice: 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, (Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar), Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah; Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah; Hayya 'alas-salah, Hayya 'alas-salah; Hayya 'alal-falah, Hayya 'alal-falah; qad qamatis-salah, qad qamati-salah, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar La ilaha illallah (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest); I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah ; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; Come to prayer, come to prayer; come to prosperity, come to prosperity; the prayer is about to begin, the prayer is about to begin, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; there is none worthy of worship except Allah)." (One of the narrators) Ibn Juraij said: ''Uthman narrated this whole report to me from his father and from Umm 'Abdul-Malik bin Abi Mahdhurah, and (said that) they heard that from Abu Mahdhurah. 
634 | ,It was narrated that Malik bin Al-Huwairith said:"I came to the Prophet (S.A.W) with a cousin of mine" - on an another occasion he said: "with a companion of mine" - "and he said: 'When the two of you travel, call the Adhan and the Iqamah, and let the older of you lead the prayer.'" 
635 | ,It was narrated that Malik bin Al-Huwairith said:"We came to the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) and we were young men close in age. He let us stay with him for twenty days. The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) was merciful and compassionate, and he thought that we were missing our families; he asked us about those whom we had left behind of our families, so we told him, and he said: 'Go back to your families, stay with them and teach them. Tell them when the time for prayer comes; let one of you call the Adhan and let the oldest of you lead the prayer.'" 
636 | ,It was narrated from Ayyub, from Abu Qilabah, from 'Amr bin Salamah:"Abu Qilabah said to me (Ayyub): He ('Amr) is still alive, do you want to meet him?" I met him and asked him, and he said: "When Makkah was conquered, all the people hastened to announce their Islam. My father went to announce the Islam of the poeple of our village, and when he came back we went to see him and he said: 'By Allah, I have indeed come to you from the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W)'. He said: 'Pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time. When the time for prayer comes let one of you call the Adhan and let the one who knows the most Qur'an lead the prayer.'" 
637 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said:"Bilal calls the Adhan during the night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum calls (the Adhan)" 
638 | ,It was narrated from Salim, from his father, that the Prophet (S.A.W) said:"Bilal calls the Adhan during the night, so eat and drink until you hear Ibn Umm Maktoom calling the Adhan." 
639 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said: 'Bilal calls the Adhan during the night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum calls the Adhan." She said: "And there was no more between than the time it takes for one to come down and the other to go up." 
640 | ,It was narrated from Khubaib bin 'Abdur-Rahman that his paternal aunt Unaisah said:"The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said: 'When Ibn Umm Maktum calls the Adhan, eat and drink, and when Bilal calls the Adhan, do not eat nor drink." 
641 | ,It was narrated from Ibn Mas'ud that the Prophet (S.A.W) said:"Bilal calls the Adhan during the night to wake those who are sleeping and so that those who are praying Qiyam can return.[1] Not to say it is like this." The break of dawn is not like this. [2]  [1] Meaning to finish. Ash-Shawkani said: "To return to sleeping or return to sitting from praying" Nail Al-Awtar.  [2] Indicating with an up and down motion. The true dawn is from right to left. 
642 | ,It was narrated from Anas that someone asked the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) about the time of Subh. The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) commanded Bilal to call the Adhan when dawn broke. Then the next day he delayed Fajr until it was very light, then he told him to call the Adhan and he prayed. Then he said:"This is the time for the prayer." 
643 | ,It was narrated from 'Awn bin Abi Juhaifah that his father said:"I came to the Prophet (S.A.W) and Bilal came out and called the Adhan and he started doing like this in his Adhan, turning to his right and left." 
644 | ,'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Abdullah bin 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Sa'sa'ah Al-Ansari Al-Mazini narrated that his father told him that Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri said to him:"I see that you love sheep and the desert. When you are with your sheep or in the desert and you call the Adhan for prayer, then raise your voice, for no human, Jinn or anything else hears the voice of the Mu'adhdhin as far as it reaches, but it will bear witness for him on the Day of Resurrection." Abu Sa'eed said: "I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W)." 
645 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah, who heard it from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W):"The Mu'adhdhin will be forgiven as far as his voice reaches, and every wet and dry thing will bear witness for him." 
646 | ,It was narrated from Al-Bara bin 'Azib that the Prophet of Allah (S.A.W) said:"Allah and His angels say salah upon the front rows, and the Mu'adhdhin will be forgiven as far as his voice reaches, and whatever hears him, wet or dry, will confirm what he says, and he will have a reward like that of those who pray with him." 
647 | ,It was narrated that Abu Mahdhurah said:"I used to call the Adhan for the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) and in the first Adhan of Fajr I used to Say: 'Hayya 'ala al-falah, as-salatu khairun minan-nawm, as-salatu khairun minan-nawm, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar, la ilaha illallah (Come to prosperity, prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, there is none worthy of worship except Allah).'" 
648 | ,Sufyan narrated a similar report with the same chain. (One of the narrators) (Abu) 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasai) said:"It is not Abu Ja'far Al-Farra'." 
649 | ,It was narrated from Al-Aswad that Bilal said:"The final words of the Adhan are: 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar; La ilaha illallah (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, there is none worthy of worship except Allah.)'" 
650 | ,It was narrated that Al-Aswad said:"The final words of the Adhan of Bilal were: 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar; La ilaha illallah (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, there is none worthy of worship except Allah.)'" 
651 | ,(Another chain) from Ibrahim, from Al-Aswad, with similar narration. 
652 | ,It was narrated that Muharib bin Dithar said:"Al-Aswad bin Yazid narrated to me from Abu Mahdhurah that the final words of the Adhan are: 'La ilaha illahha (there is none worthy of worship except Allah).'" 
653 | ,It was narrated that 'Amr bin Aws said:"A man of Thaqif told us that he heard the caller of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) on a rainy night during a journey saying: 'Hayya 'ala as-salah, Hayya 'ala al'falah, sallu fi rihalikum (Come to prayer, come to prosperity, pray in your dwellings).'" 
654 | ,It was narrated from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar gave a call to prayer on a cold and windy night, and he said:"Pray where you are, for the Prophet (S.A.W)used to order the Mu'adhdhin, if it was a cold and rainy night, to say: 'Pray in your dwellings.'" 
655 | ,Ja'far bin Muhammad narrated from his father, that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:"The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) traveled until he came to 'Arafah, where he found that the tent had been pitched for him in Namirah, so he stopped there. Then when the sun had passed its zenith he called for Qaswa'[1] and she was saddled for him. Then when he reached the bottom of the valley he addressed the people. Then Bilal called the Adhan, then he said the Iqamah and he prayed Zuhr, then he said the Iqamah and prayed 'Asr, and he did not offer any prayer in between them."  [1] The name of the Prophet's (ﷺ) mount which was a she-camel. 
656 | ,It was narrated that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:"The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) moved until he came to Al-Muzdalifah, where he prayed Maghrib and 'Isha' with one Adhan and two Iqamahs, and he did not offer any prayer in between them." 
657 | ,It was narrated that Sa'eed bin Jubair said concerning Ibn 'Umar:"We were with him (Ibn 'Umar) in Jam' (Muzdalifah), and he called the Adhan, then the Iqamah, then he led us in praying Maghrib. Then he said: 'The prayer,' and he led us in praying 'Isha', two Rak'ahs. I said: 'What is this prayer?' He said: 'This is how I prayed with the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) in this place.'" 
658 | ,It was narrated from Sa'eed bin Jubair that he prayed Maghrib and 'Isha' in Jam' (Muzdalifah) with one Iqamah, then he narrated that Ibn 'Umar had done that, and Ibn 'Umar narrated that the Prophet (S.A.W) had done that. 
659 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that he prayed in Jam'a with the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) with one Iqamah. 
660 | ,It was narrated from Salim, from his father, that the Prophet (S.A.W) joined them (Maghrib and 'Isha') in Al-Muzdalifah, and he prayed each of them with an Iqamah, and he did not offer any voluntary prayer before or after either of them. 
661 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Sa'eed that his father said:"On the day of Al-Khandaq the idolators kept us from praying Zuhr until the sun had gone down; that was before the revelation concerning fighting was revealed. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting.[1] The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded Bilal to say the Iqamah for Zuhr prayer, and he offered it just as he used to offer it on time. Then he said the Iqamah for 'Asr and he offered it just as he used to offer it on time. Then he called the Adhan for Maghrib and offered it on time."   [1] Al-Ahzab 33:25. 
662 | ,It was narrated that Abu 'Ubaidah said:"Abdullah said: 'The idolaters kept the Prophet (S.A.W) from (offering) four prayers on the day of Al-Khandaq, so he commanded Bilal to call the Adhan, then he said the Iqamah and prayed Zuhr, then he said the Iqamah and prayed 'Asr, then he said the Iqamah and prayed the Maghrib, then he said the Iqamah and prayed 'Isha'.'" 
663 | ,'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said:"We were fighting a battle and the idolators kept us from praying Zuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib and 'Isha'. When the idolaters went away, the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) commanded a caller to say Iqamah for Zuhr prayer, and we prayed. Then he said the Iqamah for 'Asr, and we prayed, and he said the Iqamah for Maghrib and we prayed, and he said the Iqamah for 'Isha' and we prayed. Then we went around among us and said: 'There is no group on Earth who is remembering Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, except you.'" 
664 | ,It was narrated that Mu'awiyah bin Hudaij that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) prayed one day and said the Taslim when there was still a Rak'ah left of the prayer. A man caught up with him and said:'You forgot a Rak'ah of the prayer!' So he came back into the Masjid and told Bilal to call the Iqamah for prayer, then he led the people in praying one Rak'ah. I told the people about that and they said to me: 'Do you know who that man was?' I said: 'No, not unless I see him.'. Then he passed by me and I said: 'This is he.' They said: 'This is Talha bin 'Ubaidullah.'" 
665 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Rubayyi'ah that he was with the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) on a journey and he heard the voice of a man calling the Adhan, and he said what he said. Then he said:"This is a shepherd or a man who is away from his family." So they looked and so it was a shepherd. 
666 | ,It was narrated that 'Uqbah bin 'Amir said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'Your Lord is pleased with a shepherd high in the mountains who calls the Adhan for the prayer and prays. Allah says: 'Look at this slave of Mine; he calls the Adhan and Iqamah for the prayer and fears Me. I have forgiven My slave and admitted him to Paradise.'" 
667 | ,It was narrated from Rifa'ah bin Rafi' that while the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) was sitting in the row for prayer. The Hadith. [1]  [1]With this chain, At-Tirmidhi recorded it (No. 302) and An-Nasai in Al-Kubra (No. 1631). It is the narration about the man who prayed incorrectly, and in it, the Prophet instructed him:"Then Tashhad, then say the Iqamah." And they say that the meaning of Tashhad here is call the Adhan. An-Nasai recorded the Hadith with different chains (1054, 1137, 1314,1315). Whereas the wording narrated by At- Tirmidhi, and the author in Al-Kubra, mentions what the author mentioned in the chapter, the other cited versions that An-Nasai in this hook quoted do not. So it is as if he narrated the chain here for Hadith, indicating the same version that At-Tirmidhi narrated, and he himself in Al-Kubra, but he did not want to narrate the actual text here. Abu Dawud also narrated it with the order for the Adhan and Iqamah, through a different route of transmission (No. 861). And it is among the proofs used for the view that the Adhan and Iqamah are obligatory - since it has been ordered in the Hadith of the one who prayed incorrectly. 
668 | ,It was narrated that Abu Al-Muthanna, the Mu'adhdhin of the Jami' Masjid, said:"I asked Ibn 'Umar about the Adhan and he said: 'At the time of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W), the phrases of the Adhan were recited twice and the phrases of Iqamah once, except that you should say (the phrase) Qad qamat is-salah (prayer is about to begin)twice. When we heard 'prayer is about to begin' we would perform Wudu' and go out to pray.'" 
669 | ,It was narrated that Malik bin Al-Huwayrith said:"The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said to me and to a companion of mine: 'When the time for prayer comes, let the two of you call the Adhan then the two of you say Iqamah, then let one of you lead the prayer.'" 
670 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (S.A.W) said:"When the call for the prayer is given, the Shaitan takes to his heels, passing wind loudly so that he will not hear the call to prayer. When the call to prayer is finished, he comes back. And when the Iqamah is said, he again takes to his heels, and after it is completed, he returns again to interfere between the (praying) person and his heart, saying to him: 'Remember such and such, remember such and such,' - things that he had not remembered - until he does not know how many (Rak'ahs) he has prayed." 
671 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said:"If the people knew what (virtue) there is in the call to prayer and the first row, and they had no other way but to draw lots concerning them, they would draw lots. If they knew what (virtue) there is in coming early for the prayer, they would compete in doing so. And if they knew what (virtue) there is in 'Atamah and Subh prayer, they would come even if they had to crawl." 
672 | ,It was narrated that 'Uthman bin Abi Al-As said:"I said: 'O Messenger of Allah (S.A.W), make me the Imam of my people.' He said: 'You are their Imam, so consider the weakest among them and choose a Mu'adhdhin who does not accept any payment for his Adhan.'" 
673 | ,It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said:"When you hear the call, say what the Mu'adhdhin says." 
674 | ,An-Nasr bin Sufyan narrated that he heard Abu Hurairah say:"We were with the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) and Bilal stood up and gave the call. When he fell silent the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever says the same as this (what the Mu'adhdhin) with certainty, he will enter Paradise. 
675 | ,It was narrated that Mujammi' bin Yahya Al-Ansari said:"I was sitting with Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunaif when the Mu'adhdhin called the Adhan. He said: 'Allahu akbar; Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest),' and he (also) pronounced the takbir twice. Then he said: 'Ashhadu an la ialaha ill-Allah (I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah),' and he also sent the testimony twice.  Then he said: 'Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah (I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah),' and he (also) sent the testimony twice. Then he said: 'This is what Mu'awiyah bin Abi Sufyan told me, narrating from statement of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W).'" 
676 | ,It was narrated that Abu Umamah bin Sahl said:"I heard Mu'awiyah say: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W), when he heard the Mu'adhdhin, repeating what he said.'" 
677 | ,It was narrated that 'Alqamah bin Waqqas said:"I was with Mu'awiyah when the Mu'adhdhin called the Adhan. Muawiyah said what the Mu'adhdhin said, but when he said: 'Hayya 'alas-salah (come to prayer),' he said: 'La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (There is no power and no strength except with Allah);' and when he said: 'Hayya 'alal-falah (come to prosperity),' he said: 'La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (There is no power and no strength except with Allah).' After that he said what the Mu'adhdhin said, then he said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) saying exactly like that.'" 
678 | ,'Abdullah bin 'Amr said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) say: 'When you hear the Mu'adhdhin then say what he says, and do Salah upon me, for whoever does Salah upon me once, Allah will Salah upon him ten (times). Then ask Allah to grant me Al-Wasilah, which is a position in paradise which only one of the slaves of Allah will attain, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for Al-Wasilah for me, will be entitled to my intercession.'" 
679 | ,It was narrated from Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said:"Whoever says, when he hears the Mu'adhdhin: 'Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu wa anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa Rasuluhu, raditu Billahi Rabban, wa bil-Islami dinan was bi Muhammadin Rasula (I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad is the His slave and Messenger; I am content with Allah as my Lord, Islam as my religion and Muhammad as my Messenger),' his sins will be forgiven." 
680 | ,It was narrated that Jabir said:"The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said: 'Whoever says, when he hears the call to prayer: "Allahumma rabba hadhihid-da'wat it-tammah was-salat il-qaimah, ati Muahmmadan al-wasilah wal-fadilah, wab'athu maqaman mahmudan alladhi wa'adtahu (O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and the prayer to be offered, grant Muhammad the privilege (of interceding) and also the eminence, and resurrect him to the praised position that you have promised),' will be granted my intercession on the Day of Resurrection." 
681 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin Mughaffal said:"The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said: 'Between each two Adhans [1] there is a prayer, between each two Adhans there is a prayer, between each two Adhans there is a prayer, for whoever wants to do it."  [1]Meaning, between the Adhan and Iqamah. 
682 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"When the Mu'adhdhin called the Adhan, some of the Companions of the Prophet (S.A.W) would get up and rush to the pillars (in the Masjid) and pray until the Prophet (S.A.W) came out and they were like that. They would pray before Maghrib and there was nothing between the Adhan and Iqamah." 
683 | ,It was narrated from Ash'ath bin Abi Ash-Sha'tha' that his father said:"I saw Abu Hurairah, when a man passed by in the Masjid until he parted from it - after the call. Abu Hurairah said: 'This man has indeed disobeyed Abu Al-Qasim (S.A.W).'" 
684 | ,Abu Sakhrah narrated that Abu Ash-Sha'tha' said:"A man left the Masjid after the call to prayer had been given, and Abu Hurairah said: 'This man has indeed disobeyed Abu Al-Qasim (S.A.W).'" 
685 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Between the time when he finished 'Isha' prayer and Fajr, the Prophet (S.A.W) used to pray eleven Rak'ahs, saying the Taslim after each two Rak'ahs, then praying Witr as one Rak'ah. He would prostrate for as long as it takes one of you to recite fifty verses, then he would raise his head. When the Mu'adhdhin finished the call to Fajr prayer and he could see the dawn, he would pray two brief Rak'ahs, then he would go out with him." Some of these narrators (Ibn Abi Dhi'b, Yunus and 'Amr bin Al-Harith) added some phrases not mentioned by the others in the Hadith. 
686 | ,It was narrated from Makhramah bin Sulaiman that Kuraib - the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas - told him:"I asked Ibn 'Abbas: 'How did the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) pray at night?'

689 | ,It was narrated from Anas that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"One of the portents of the Hour will be that people will show off in building Masjids." 
690 | ,It was narrated that Ibrahim said:"I used to recite Qur'an to my father on the road, and if I recited a verse in which prostration was required, he would prostrate. I said: 'O my father, do you prostrate on the street?' He said: 'I heard Abu Dharr say: "I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): 'Which Masjid was built first?' He said: 'Al-Masjid Al-Haram.' [1] I said: 'Then which?' He said: 'Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa.' [2] I said: 'How long was there between them?' He said: 'Forty years. And the earth is a Masjid (or a place of prostration) for you, so wherever you are when the time for prayer comes, pray.'"  [1] In Makkah. [2] "Furthest Masjid", meaning the Masjid in Jerulsalem. 
691 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that Maimunah the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Whoever prays in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (that is good), for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ' One prayer offered there is better than a thousand prayers offered elsewhere, except the Masjid of the Ka'bah.'" 
692 | ,It was narrated from Salim that his father said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered the House (the Ka'bah), with Usamah bin Zaid, Bilal and 'Uthman bin Talhah, and they locked the door behind them. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) opened it, I was the first one to enter. I met Bilal and asked him: 'Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pray inside?' He said: 'Yes, he prayed between the two Yemeni columns.'" 
693 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Amr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"When Sulaiman bin Dawud finished building Bait Al-Maqdis, he asked Allah for three things: Judgement that was in harmony with His judgement, and he was given that. And he asked Allah for a dominion that no one after him would have, and he was given that. And when he finished building the Masjid he asked Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, that no one should come to it, intending only to pray there, but he would emerge free of sin as the day his mother bore him." 
694 | ,It was narrated from Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman and Abu 'Abdullah Al-Agharr, the freed slave of the Juhanis - better of whom were companions of Abu Hurairah - that they heard Abu Hurairah say:"One prayer in the Masjid of the  Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is better than one thousand prayers offered in other mosques, except Al-Masjid Al-Haram, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was the last of the prophets and his Masjid was the last of the Masjids." Abu Salamah and Abu 'Abdullah said: "We do not doubt that Abu Hurairah was speaking on the basis of the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but we could not verify that Hadith with Abu Hurairah before he died. Then we remembered that and we blamed one another for not having spoken to Abu Hurairah about that, so that he could attribute it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) if he had indeed heard it from him. While we were arguing, we went and sat down with 'Abdullah bin Ibrahim bin Qariz, and we told him about the Hadith and how we had been negligent in not checking it with Abu Hurairah. 'Abdullah bin Ibrahim said to us: 'I bear witness that I heard Abu Hurairah say: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I am the last of the prophets and it is the last of the Masjids.'"

700 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Mounts are not saddled for except to (travel to) three Masjids: Al-Masjid Al-Haram, this Masjid of mine, and Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa."

We told him that in our land there was a church that belonged to us. We asked him to give us the leftovers of his purification (Wudu' water). So he called for water, performed Wudu' and rinsed out his mouth, then he poured it into a vessel and said to us: 'Leave, and when you return to your land, demolish your church, and sprinkle this water on that place, and take it as a Masjid.' We said: 'Our land is far away and it is very hot; the water is far away and it is very hot; the water will dry up.' He said: 'Add more water to it, for that will only make it better.'

It is as if I can see the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on his she-camel with Abu Bakr riding behind him (on the same camel) and the chiefs of Banu An-Najjar around him, until he dismounted in the courtyard of Abu Ayyub. The Prophet (ﷺ) used to offer the prayer wherever he was when the time for prayer came, and he would pray even in sheepfolds. Then he ordered that the Masjid be built.

There were eighty-odd men, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) accepted what they declared and accepted their oaths of allegiance; he prayed for forgiveness for them and left whatever was in their hearts to Allah. Then when I came and greeted him, he smiled as one who is angry, then he said: 'Come here.' So I came and sat in front of him, [1] and he said: 'What kept you behind? Did you not buy a mount?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, if I were to sit before anyone other than you of those who hold high positions in this world, I would find a way to avoid his anger. I am an eloquent man but, by Allah, I know that if I were to tell you a lie today to make you pleased with me, Allah would soon make you angry with me, but if I tell you the truth, it will make you angry with me, but I will still have the hope that Allah may forgive me. I have never been in a better position, physically or financially, than the time when I stayed behind and did not join you.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'This man has spoken the truth. Go away until Allah decides concerning you.' So I got up and went away." This is an abridged version of narration.  [1] It is this which the author cited the narration for.

When he completed the prayer he turned to face the people and said: '0 people, why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever among you comes across something in the prayer should say: 'Subhan Allah' for there is none who will not turn round when they hear him saying Subhan Allah. 0 Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I gestured to you to do so?' Abu Bakr replied: 'It is not fitting for the son of Abu Quhafah to lead the prayer in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).'"

Abu Bakr was such that whenever he started praying, he would never glance sideways, but when he noticed that the clapping persisted he turned around. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gestured to him to carry on praying. Abu Bakr praised Allah the Mighty and Sublime for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) having told him to continue. Then Abu Bakr moved backward on his heels, and when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that, he came forward and led the people in prayer. When he completed the prayer he said: 'O Abu Bakr, when I gestured to you, what kept you from continuing (to lead the people)?'

When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt a little better, he came with the help of two men, one of whom was Al-'Abbas, to pray Zuhr. When Abu Bakr saw him, he wanted to step back, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gestured to him not to step back.

You delayed the prayer, and he prayed with you then he came back to lead us in prayer, and he started to recite Shut Al-Baqarah. When I heard that, I stepped aside and prayed by myself, because we are people who bring water with the camels and we work hard.'

And the virtue of the first row is like that of the row of the angels. If you knew its virtue, you would compete for it. A man's prayer with another man is greater in reward than his prayer alone. And a man's prayer with two other men is greater in reward than his prayer with one other man; the more people there are, the more beloved that is to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime."'

I do not think that there is anyone among you who does not have a place where he prays in his house. But if you were to pray in your houses and forsake the Masjids, you would be forsaking the Sunnah of your Prophet, and if you were to forsake the Sunnah of your Prophet you would go astray. There is no Muslim slave who performs Wudu and does it well, then walks to the prayer, but Allah will record one Hasanah (good deed) for each step he takes, or raise' him one level by it or erase one sin from him. I remember how we used to take short steps, and I remember (a time) when no one stayed behind from the prayer except a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known. And I have seen a man coming Supported by two others until he would be made to stand in the row."

When the Imam says the takbir and bows, then say the takbir and bow, for the Imam bows before you and stands up before you.' The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'This makes up for that.

Abu Bakr never used to turn around when he prayed, but when they clapped consistently he realized something must have happened while they were praying. So he turned around and saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gestured to him to stay where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hands and praised and thanked Allah (SWT) for what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said. Then, he moved backwards, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went forward and prayed.

He said: 'The enemy of Allah (SWT), Iblis, came with a brand of fire to throw it in my face, so I said: I seek refuge with Allah from you three times, then I wanted to take hold of him.

May my father and mother be ransomed for him, he neither did hit me nor rebuke me nor revile me. I have never seen a better teacher than him, before or after. He said: 'This prayer of ours is not the place for ordinary human speech, rather it is glorification and magnification of Allah (SWT), and reciting Qur'an.' Then I went out to a flock of sheep of mine that was tended by a slave woman of mine beside Uhud and Al-Jawwaniyyah, and I found that the wolf had taken one of the sheep. I am a man from the sons of Adam and I get upset as they get upset. So I slapped her. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him what happened. He regarded that as a serious action on my part. I said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), should I set her free?' He said: 'Call her.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her: 'Where is Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime?' She said: 'Above the heavens.' He said: 'And who am I?' She said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).'

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Do not say peace (salam) be upon Allah (SWT), for Allah (SWT) is As-Salam (the Source of peace; the One free from all faults). Rather say: At-tahiyyatu lillahi wasalawatu wat-tayibaat, as-salamu 'alaika ayah-Nabiyyu wa rahmatAllahi wa baraktuhu. As-salamu 'alaina a 'ala ibad illahis-salihin (All compliments, prayers and pure words are due to Allah. Peace be upon you O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah.) If you say that, it will be for every righteous slave in the heavens and on earth, "ashadu an la ilaha ill Allah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuluhu (I bear witness that that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger.)

Ya hayyu ya qayyum! Inni as'aluka. (O Allah, indeed I ask You since all praise is due to You, there is none worthy of worship but You, the Bestower, the Creator of the heavens and earth, O Possessor of majesty and honor, O Ever-living, O-Eternal, I ask of You.)' The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Do you know what he has supplicated with?' They said: "Allah (SWT) and His Messenger know best." He said: 'By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, he called upon Allah by His greatest Name, which, if He is called by it, He responds, and if He is asked by it, He gives.'"

Bi-annakal-Wahidul-Ahad us-Samad, alladhi lam yalid wa lam yowled, wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad, an taghfirali dhunubi, innaka antal-Ghafurur-Rahim (O Allah, I ask of You, O Allah, as You are the One, the Only, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who begets not nor was He begotten, and there is None equal or comparable to Him, forgive me my sins, for You are the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)"

1305 | ,Ata bn As-Sa'ib narrated that his father said:"Ammar bin Yasir led us in prayer and he made it brief. Some of the people said to him: 'You made the prayer sort (or brief).' He said: 'Nevertheless I still recited supplications that I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' When he got up and left, a man -- he was my father but he did not name himself -- followed him and asked him about that supplication, then he came and told the people:   "Allāhumma bi `ilmikal-ghaiba wa qudratika 'alal-khalqi aḥyinī mā `alimtal-ḥayāta khairan lī, wa tawaffanī idhā `alimtal-wafāta khairan lī.

And I ask You for everlasting delight and joy that will never cease. I ask You to make me pleased with that which You have decreed and for an easy life after death. I askYou for the sweetness of looking upon Your face and a longing to meet You in a manner that does not entail a calamity that will bring about harm or a trial that will cause deviation. O Allah, beautify us with the adornment of faith and make us among those who guide and are rightly guided." 
1306 | ,It was narrated that Qais bin 'Ubad said:"Ammar bin Yasir led the people in prayer and he made the prayer short.

O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, and I seek refuge in Your forgiveness from Your punishment, and I seek refuge in You from You. None can withhold what you have given and none can give what you have withheld, and no wealth or fortune can avail the man of wealth and fortune before You.)'"

And I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) counting them on his hands. 'And when one of you retires to his bed he says the tasbih thirty-three times and the tahmid thirty-three times and the takbir thirty-four times, that is one hundred on the tongue and one thousand in the balance.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "So which of you does two thousand five hundred bad deeds in a day and a night?" It was said: "O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), how can a person not persist in doing that?"

Then he stayed one month on the night when he used to go back home, and he addressed the people and enjoined upon them whatever Allah (SWT) willed. Then he said: 'I used to observe I'tikaf during these ten days, then I decided to spend the last ten days in I'tikaf. So whoever was observing I'tikaf with me, let him stay in his place of I'tikaf, for I was shown this night (Lailatul Qadr), then I was caused to forget it, so seek it during the last ten nights on the odd-numbered nights.

We said: 'O Messenger of Allah (SA), why don't you lead us in praying Qiyam for the rest of the night?' He said: 'If a man prays with the Imam until he leaves, that will be continued for him as if he spent the whole night in prayer.' Then, when there were four days left, he did not lead us in praying Qiyam. When there were three days left he sent for his daughters and women, and gathered the people, and he led us in praying Qiyam until we feared that we would miss Al-Falah.

Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except as Muslims; O Mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him he created his wife, and from them he created many men and women, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship).

There is no living creature on Earth that does not listen out from Friday morning until the sun rises, fearing the onset of the Hour, except the son of Adam.

If you see either of them being eclipsed, then hasten to remember Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, Paradise was brought so near to me that if I had stretched out my hand, I could have taken some of its fruits. And Hell was brought so near to me that I tried to ward it off for fear it may overwhelm you. I saw therein a woman from Himyar who was being punished because of a cat she tied up, not leaving it free to eat of the vermin of the earth, nor feeding it or giving it water, until it died. I saw it biting her when she came and biting her backside when she went. And I saw the owner of the Sabtiyatain, the brother of Banu As-Da'da, being pushed with a  two-pronged stick in the Fire. And I saw the owner of the stick with a crooked end, who used to steal from the Hajj pilgrims with that crooked stick, leaning on his stick in Hell and saying: 'I am the thief with the crooked stick.'"

Then he prostrated for a long time, then he sat up, then he prostrated for a long time that was shorter than the first time. Then he stood up and bowed twice again, doing the same again. Then he prostrated twice, doing the same again, until he had finished his prayer. Then he said: 'The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah (SWT), and they do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see that then hasted to remember Allah (SWT) and pray.'" 
1484 | ,Tha'labah bin 'Abbad Al-'Abdi from the people of Al-Basrah narrated that:He attended a Khutbah one day that was delivered by Samurah bin Jundub. In his Khutbah he mentioned a hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Samurah bin Jundub said: "One day a boy from among the Ansar and I were shooting at two targets of ours, during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), when the sun was at a height of two or three spears as it appears to one who is looking at the horizon. The sun turned black, and we said to one another, let us go to the masjid, for by Allah (SWT) this must herald some event concerning the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his ummah. We went to the masjid and we saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) coming out to the people. He went forward and prayed. He stood for the longest time that he had ever stood in any prayer in which he led us, but we did not hear him saying anything. Then he bowed for the longest time that he had ever bowed in any prayer in which he led us, but we did not hear him saying anything. Then he prostrated for the longest time that he had ever prostrated in any prayer in which he led us, but we did not hear him saying anything. The he did likewise in the second rak'ah. And the eclipse ended as he was sitting at the end of the second rak'ah. The he said the salam, then he praised and glorified Allah (SWT), and bore witness that there is none worthy of worship but Allah (SWT) and he bore witness that he was the slave and Messenger of Allah." Narrated in abridged form. 
1485 | ,It was narrated that An-Nu'man bin Bashir said:"The sun eclipsed during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he rushed out, dragging his cloak until he came to the masjid. He continued leading us in prayer until the eclipse ended. When it ended, he said: 'People claim that the eclipse of the sun and moon only happen when a great man dies, but that is not so. Eclipses of the sun and the moon do not happen for the death or birth of anyone, but they are signs from Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime. When Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, manifests Himself to anything of His creation, it humbles itself before Him, so if you see that then pray like the last obligatory prayer you did before that.'" 
1486 | ,It was narrated that Qabisah bin Mukhariq Al-Hilali said:"There was an eclipse of the sun and at the time we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in Al-Madinah. He rushed out dragging his garment and prayed two rak'ahs, which he made lengthy. The end of his prayer coincided with the end of the eclipse. He praised and glorified Allah (SWT), then he said: 'The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah (SWT), and they do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see anything of that, then pray like the last obligatory prayer you did before that.'" 
1487 | ,It was narrated from Qabisah Al-Hilali:That there was an eclipse of the sun and the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) prayed two rak'ahs until it ended. Then he said: "The sun and the moon do not become eclipsed for the death of anyone, but they are two of His creations. Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, causes whatever He wants to happen in His creation. If Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, manifests Himself to any of His creation, it humbles itself before Him, so if either of them (solar or lunar eclipse) happens, pray until it is over or until Allah causes something to happen." 
1488 | ,It was narrated from An-Nu'man bin Bashir that :The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "If there is an eclipse of the sun or the moon, pray like the last obligatory prayer you did before that."

1490 | ,It was narrated from An-Nu'man bin Bashir that :The Prophet (ﷺ) came rushing out to the masjid one day when the sun eclipsed, and he prayed until the eclipse ended, then he said: "The people of Jahilliyyah used to say that eclipses of the sun and the moon only happened when some great man on earth died. But eclipses of the sun and the moon do not happen for the death or birth of anyone. Rather they are two of the creations of Allah (SWT) and Allah (SWT) causes to happen in His creation what He wills. Whichever of them becomes eclipsed, pray until it is over or Allah (SWT) causes something to happen." 
1491 | ,It was narrated that Abu Bakrah said:"We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when the sun became eclipsed. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out dragging his garment, until he came to the masjid, and the people gathered around him. He led us in praying two rak'ahs and when (the eclipse) ended he said: 'The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah (SWT) by means of which Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, strikes fear into His slaves. They do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see that, then pray until Allah (SWT)r relieves you of fear.' That was because his son named Ibrahim had died, and the people suggested to him that (the eclipse) happened because of that." 
1492 | ,It was narrated from Abu Bakrah that:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed two rak'ahs like this prayer of yours, and he mentioned the eclipse of the sun. 
1493 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin Abbas said:"There was an eclipse of the sun and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed and the people with him. He stood for long time reciting something like Surah Al-Baqarah, then he raised (his head) and stood for a long time, then he raised (his head) and stood for a long time which was shorter than the first time. Then he bowed for a long time, which was shorter than the first time, then he prostrated. Then he got up and stood for a long time, which was shorter than the first time, then he bowed for a long time, which was shorter than the first time, then he raised (his head) and stood for a long time, which was shorter than the first time. Then he bowed for a long time, which was shorter than the first time, then he prostrated, then he finished (his prayer) and the sun had been clear. He said: 'The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah (SWT) and they do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see that then remember Allah (SWT) the Mighty and Sublime.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we saw you stretching out your hand when you were standing, then we saw you moving backward. He said: 'I saw Paradise-or it was shown to me- and I reached out to a take a bunch of its fruits. If I ha taken it you would have eaten from it for as long as this world lasts. And I saw Hell and I have never seen anything like it, and I saw that most of its inhabitants are women.' They said: "Why, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: 'Because of their ingratitude.' It was said: 'Are they ungrateful to Allah?' He said: 'They are ungrateful to their husbands and they are ungrateful for kind treatment. If you are kind to one of them for a lifetime, then she sees (one) bad thing from you, she will say: I have never seen anything good from you.'" 
1494 | ,It was narrated from Aishah that:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed, bowing four times, and he recited loudly, and every time he raised his head he said: "Sami Allahu liman hamidah. Rabbana wa lakal-hamd (Allah hears those who praise Him, Our Lord to You be praise.)." 
1495 | ,It was narrated from Samurah that:The Prophet (ﷺ) led them in prayer during an eclipse of the sun, and we did not hear him say anything. 
1496 | ,It was narrated that Abdullah bin Amr said:"The sun eclipsed during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed and stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up and (remained standing) for a long time." (One of the narrators) Shu'bh said: "I think he said something similar concerning prostration."- "He started weeping and blowing during his prostration and said: 'Lord, You did not tell me that You would do that while I am asking You for forgiveness; You did not tell me that You would do that while I was still among them.' When he finished praying he said: "Paradise was shown to me, and if I had stretched forth my hand I could have taken some of its fruits. And Hell was shown to me, so I started blowing for fear that its heat might overwhelm you. I saw therein the thief who stole the two camels of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); and I saw therein the brother of Banu As-Du'du; the thief who stole from the pilgrims, and when he was caught he said: The crooked stick did it; and I saw therein a tall black woman who was being punished because of a cat she tied up and did not feed or give it water, and she did not let it eat of the vermin of the earth, until it died. Then sun and the moon do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone, but they are two of the signs of Allah. If one of them becomes eclipsed'- or he said: 'if one of them does anything like that'- 'then hasten to remember Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.'"

The worst of things are those that are newly invented; every newly-invented thing is an innovation and every innovation is going astray, and every going astray is in the Fire.' Then he said: 'The Hour and I have been sent like these two.' Whenever he mentioned the Hour, his cheeks would turn red, and he would raise his voice and become angry, as if he were warning of an approaching army and saying: 'An army is coming to attack you in the morning, or in the evening!'

He said: "I wanted to get up (and leave), then I thought of the Qiyam (night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: "Tell me about the Qiyam of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)." She said: "Do you not recite this surah: "O you wrapped in garments?" I said: "Yes." She said: "Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, made Qiyam Al-Lail obligatory at the beginning of this surah, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his companions prayed Qiyam Al-Lail for one year. Allah (SWT) withheld the latter part of this surah for twelve months, then he revealed the lessening (of this duty) at the end of this surah, so Qiyam Al-Lail became voluntary after it had been obligatory."  I felt inclined to stand up (and not ask anything further), then I thought of the witr of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I said: "O Mother of the Believers, tell me about the witr of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)." She said: "We used to prepare his siwak and water for his ablution, and Allah (SWT) would wake him when He wished during the night. He would use the siwak, perform ablution, and then pray eight rak'ahs in which he would not sit until he reached the eighth one. Then he would sit and remember Allah (SWT) and supplicate, then he would say the taslim that we could hear. Then he would pray two rak'as sitting after uttering the taslim, then he would pray one rak'ah, and that made eleven rak'ahs, O my son! When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) grew older and put on weight, he prayed witr with seven rak'ahs, then he prayed two rak'ahs sitting down after saying the taslim, and that made nine rak'ahs. O my son, when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)offered a prayer, he liked to continue to offer it, and when sleep, sickness, or pain distracted him from praying Qiyam Al-Lail, he would pray twelve rak'ahs during the day. I am not aware of the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) having recited the whole Qur'an during a single night, or praying through the whole night until morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan." I went to Ibn 'Abbas and told him what she had said, and he said: "She has spoken the truth. If I could go to her (and meet her face to face) I would so that she could tell me all of that verbally." 
1602 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Whoever prays Qiyam during Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward, he will be forgiven his previous sins." 
1603 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Whoever prays Qiyam during Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward, he will be forgiven his previous sins." 
1604 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed in the masjid one night, and some people followed his prayer. Then he prayed the following night and more people came. Then they gathered on the third or fourth night and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come out to them. When morning came he said: "I saw what you did, and nothing prevented me from coming out to you but the fact that I feared that this would be made obligatory for you," and that was in Ramadan. 
1605 | ,It was narrated that Abu Dharr said:"We fasted with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in Ramadan and he did not lead us in praying Qiyam until there were seven days left in the month, when he led us in praying Qiyam until one-third of the night had passed. Then he did not lead us in praying Qiyam when there were six days left. Then he led us praying Qiyam when there were five days left until one-half of the night had passed. I said: "O Messenger of Allah! What if we spend the rest of this night praying Nafl?" He said: "Whoever prays Qiyam with the Imam until he finishes, Allah (SWT) will record for him the Qiyam of a (whole) night." Then he did not lead us in prayer or pray Qiyam until there were three days of the month left. Then he led us in praying Qiyam when there were three days left. He gathered his family and wives (and led us in prayer) until we feared that we would miss Al-Falah. I (one of the narrators) said: "What is Al-Falah?" He said: "The suhur". 
1606 | ,Nu'aim bin Ziyad Abu Talhah said:"I heard An-Nu'man bin Bashir on the minbar in Hims saying: "We prayed Qiyam with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during Ramadan on the night of the twenty-third until one-third of the night had passed, then we prayed Qiyam with him on the night of the twenty-fifth until one-half of the night had passed, then we prayed Qiyam with him on the night of the twenty-seventh until we thought that we would miss Al-Falah- that is what they used to call suhur." 
1607 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'When any one of you goes to sleep, the Shaitan ties three knots on his head, saying each time: "(Sleep) a long night." If he wakes up and remembers Allah (SWT), one knot is undone. If he performs wudu', another knot is undone. If he prays, all the knots are undone and he starts his day in a good mood and feeling energetic. Otherwise he starts his day in a bad mood and feeling lethargic.'" 
1608 | ,It was narrated that Abdullah said:"Mention was made in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about a man who slept all night until morning. He said: 'That is a man in whose ear the Shaitan has urinated.'" 
1609 | ,It was narrated that Abdullah said:"A man said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So-and-so slept and missed the prayer yesterday until morning came.' He said: 'The Shaitan has urinated in that one's ears.'" 
1610 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'May Allah (SWT) have mercy on a man who gets up at night and prays, then he wakes his wife and she prays, and if she refuses he sprinkles water in her face. And may Allah (SWT) have mercy on a woman who gets up at night and prays, then she wakes her husband and prays, and if he refuses she sprinkles water in his face.'" 
1611 | ,It was narrated from 'Ali bin Abi Talib that:The Prophet (ﷺ) came to him and Fatimah at night and said: "Won't you pray?" I said: "O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), our souls are in the hand of Allah and if He wants to make us get up, He will make us get up." The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went away when I said that to him. Then as he was leaving I heard him striking his thigh and saying: But, man is ever more quarrelsome than anything. 
1612 | ,It was narrated from Ali bin Husain, from his father, that:Hs grandfather Ali bin Abi Talib said: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came in to Fatimah and I, one night and woke us up to pray, then he went back to his house and prayed for part of the night, and he did not hear any movement from us. He came back to us and woke us up, and said: 'Get up and pray.' I sat up, rubbing my eyes, and said: 'By Allah, we will only pray that which has decreed for us; our souls are in the hand of Allah (SWT) and if He wants to make us get up, He will make us get up.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned away, striking his hand on his thigh, saying: 'We will only pray that which Allah (SWT) has decreed for us! But man is ever more quarrelsome than anything.'" 
1613 | ,It was narrated from Humaid bin 'Abdur-Rahman- that is Ibn 'Awf, that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The best fasting after the month of Ramadan is the month of Allah, Al-Muharram, and the best prayer is prayer at night.'" 
1614 | ,It was narrated from Abu Bishr Ja'far bin Abi Wahshiyyah that:He heard Humaid bin 'Abdur-Rahman say: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The best prayer after the obligatory (fard) prayers is prayer at night and the best fasting after the month of Ramadan is Al-Muharram.'" Shu'bah bin Al-Hajjaj narrated it in Mursal form. 
1615 | ,It was narrated from Zaid bin Zabyan who attributed it to Abu Dharr that:The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "There are three whom Allah (SWT) loves: A man who comes to some people and asks (to be given something) for the sake of Allah and not for the sake of their relationship, but they do not give him, so a man stayed behind and gave it to him in secret, and no one knew of his giving except Allah (SWT) and the one to whom he gave it. People who travel all night until sleep becomes dearer to them than anything equated with it, so they lay down their heads (and slept), then a man among them got up and started praying to Me and beseeching Me, reciting My Verses. And a man who was on a campaign and met the enemy and they fled, but he went forward (pursuing them) until he was killed or victory was granted." 
1616 | ,It was narrated that Masruq said:"I said to 'Aishah: 'Which deed was most beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?' She said: 'That which was done persistently.' I said: 'At what part of the night did he pray Qiyam?' She said: 'When he heard the rooster.'" 
1617 | ,It was narrated that 'Asim bin Humaid said:"I asked 'Aishah with what did he- meaning the Prophet (ﷺ)- start Qiyam Al-Lail? She said: 'You have asked me something which no one before you has asked. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say the takbir ten times, the tahmid ten times, the tasbih ten times, and the tahlil ten times, and pray for forgiveness ten times, and say: Allahummaghfirli, wahdini, warzuqni wa 'afini. A'udhu billahi min diqil-maqami yawmal-qiyamah (O Allah, forgive me, guide me, grant me provision and good health. I seek refuge with Allah from the difficulty of standing on the Day of Resurrection.)" 
1618 | ,It was narrated that Rabi'ah bin Ka'b Al-Aslami said:"I used to stay overnight at the Prophet's (ﷺ) apartment and I used to hear him when he prayed Qiyam at night saying: 'Subhan Allahi Rabil-Alamin (Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds)' for a long time, then he said: 'Subhan Allah wa bi hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allah) for a long time." 
1619 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"When the Prophet (ﷺ) got up at night to pray Tahajjud, he said: Allahumma, lakal-hamdu anta nurus-samawati wal-ardi wa man fihinna wa lakal-hamdu anta qayyamus-samawati wal ardi wa man fihinna wa lakal-hamdu, anta haqqun wa wa'duka haqqun wal jannatu haqqun wan-nuru haqqun wan-nabiyyuna haqqun wa Muhammadan haqqun, laka aslant wa 'alaika tawakkaltu wa bika amant. ( O Allah, to You be praise, You are the Light of the heavens and earth and whoever is in them. To You be praise, You are the Sustainer of the Heavens and the earth and whoever is in them. To You be praise, You are the Sovereign of the heavens and earth and whoever is in them. To You be praise; You are True, Your promise is true, Paradise is true, Hell is true, the Hour is true, the Prophets are true and Muhammad is true. To You have I submitted, in You I put my trust and in You I have believed.'" Then (one of the narrators) Qutaibah mentioned some words the meaning of which was: "Wa bika khasamtu wa ilaika hakamtu, ighfirli ma quadrate wa ma akhkhartu wa ma a'lantu antal-muqaddimu wa antal-mu'khkhir, la ilaha illa anta wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (And with Your help I argue [with my opponents, the non-believers], and I take You as a judge [to judge between us]. Forgive me my past and future sins and those that I commit openly. You are the One who puts [some people] back and bring [others] forward. There is no God but You and there is no power and no strength except with Allah).'" 
1620 | ,It was narrated from Kuraib that 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas told him:He slept at the house of Maimunah the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), who was his maternal aunt. He said: "I laid down across the mattress an the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his wife lay along it. The Prophet (ﷺ) slept until midnight, or a little before or a little after. The Prophet (ﷺ) woke up and began to rub the sleep from his face with his hand. Then he recited the last ten verses of Surah Al Imran. Then he got up and went to a water skin that was hanging up and performed wudu from it, and he performed wudu well, then he stood up and prayed." Abdullah bin 'Abbas said: "I stood up and did what he had done, then I went and stood beside him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) put his right hand on my neck, and took old of my right hand and tweaked it. Then he prayed two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then he prayed witr.Then he lay down until the Mu'adhdhin came to him and he prayed two brief rak'ahs."

She said: 'When he got up to pray at night he would start his prayer with the words: Allahumma Rabba Jibril wa Maika'il wa Israfil; Fatirus-samawati wal-ard, 'alim al-ghaybi wash-shahadah, anta tahkumu bayna 'ibadika fima kanu fihi yakhtalifun, Allahumma ihdini limakktulifa fihi min al-haqq innaka tahdi man tasha'ila siratin mustaqim (O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika'il and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You judge between Your slaves concerning wherein they differ. O Allah, guide me to the disputed matters of truth for You are the One Who guides to the Straight Path)."

When he prayed 'Isha, he lay down for a long time. Then he woke up and looked toward the horizon and said: "Our Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose" until he reached: "for You never break (Your) Promise." Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) reached across his bed and took a siwak from it, then he poured water from a vessel and cleaned his teeth. Then he stood and prayed until I said: He has prayed for as long as he has slept. Then he lay down until I said: He has slept as long as he prayed.

1629 | ,It was narrated from Ya'la bin Mamlak that he asked Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) about the recitation and prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Yes indeed. This is a prayer of hope and fear in which I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, for three things, of which He gave me two and did not grant me one. I asked my Lord not to destroy us with which he destroyed the nations before us, and He granted me that. And I asked my Lord not to let an enemy from without prevail over us, and He granted me that.

He said: "Observe the best of fasts, the fast of Dawud, peace be upon him: Fasting for one day and breaking the fast for one day."

She said: 'What a wonderful man he is. He does not sleep at night and he does not break his fast during the day.' He got upset with me and said: 'I got you married to a woman from among the Muslims and you have neglected her.' I did not pay attention to what he said because of my energy and love of worship. News of that reached the Prophet and he said: 'But I stand (in prayer) and I sleep, I fast and I break my fast. So stand (in prayer) and sleep, fast and break your fast.' He said: 'Fast three days of every month.' I said: 'I am able to do more than that.' He said: 'O bserve the fast of Dawud, peace be upon him: fast one day and break your fast one day.' I said: 'I am able to do more than that.' He said: 'Read the Quran (once) every month.' Then it ended up being every fifteen days, and I still said: 'I am able to do more than that."'

For your eyes have a right over you, your body has a right over you, your body has a right over you, your wife has a right over you, your guest has a right over you, and your friend has a right over you. I hope that you will have a long life and that it will be sufficient for you to fast three days of each month. That is fasting for a lifetime, because a good deed is equal to ten like it.' I said : 'I feel able to do more.' I was strict, so I was dealt with strictly. He said: 'Fast three days each week.' I said: 'I am ableto do more thtn that; I was strict, so I was dealt with strictly. He said: 'Observe the fast of the Prophet of Allah, Dawud, peace be upon him.

Fast and break your fast, sleep and stand (in prayer), and fast three days of each month. For a good deed is equal to ten like it, and that is like fasting for a lifetime.' I said: 'But I am able to do bette than that.' He said: 'Fast for one day and break your fast for two days.' I said: 'I am able to do better than that, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Then fast for one day and break your fast for two days.' I said: 'I am able to do better than that, O Messenger of Allah said : 'There is noting better than that."'

The Messenger of Allah heard about that, and came in to me in my house, and said: I have heard that you said, I will fast for a lifetime and will read the Quran. I said: I did say that, O Messenger of Allah. He said; Do not do that. Fast three days of each month. I said: I am able to do more than that. He said: fast two days of each week, Monday and Thursday. I said: I am able to do more than that. He said; Observe the fast of Dawud, peace be upon him, for it is the best kind of fasting before Allah; one day fasting, and one day not fasting. And when he made a promise he did not break it, and when he met (the enemy in battle) he did not flee."

Then he raised his head with joy on his face, and that was dearer to us than red camels. Then he said: 'There is no one who offers the five (daily) prayers, fasts Ramadan, pays Zakah and avoid the seven major sins, but the gates of Paradise will be opened to him, and it will be said to him: Enter in peace."' 
2439 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah say" 'Whoever spends on a pair of things in the cause of Allah, he will be called from the gates of Paradise: O slave of Allah, this is good for you. Paradise had (several) gates. Whoever is one of the people of Salah, he will be called from the gate of prayer. Whoever is one of the people of Jihad, will be called from the gate of Jihad. Whoever is one of the people of charity will be called from the gate of charity. And whoever is one of the people of fasting will be called from the gate of Ar-Rayyan."

He said: "those who have a lot of wealth, except one who does like this, and like this, and like this,' (motioning) in front of him, and to his right, and to his left. Then he said: 'By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no man dies leaving camels, or cattle, or sheep on which he did not pay the Zakah, but they will come on the Day of Resurrection as big and fat as they ever were, trampling him with their hooves and goring him with their horns. Every time the last of them runs over him, the first of them will come back, until judgment is passed among the people."'

Nay, it will be worse for them; the things which they covetously withheld, shall be tied toothier necks like a collar on the Day of Resurrection."' 
2442 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'Any man who has camels and does not pay what is due on them in its Najdah or its Risl mean?' He said: 'In times of hardship or in times of ease; they will come on the Day of Resurrection as energetic, fat and lively as they ever were. He will be laid face down in a flat arena for them and they will trample him with their hooves. When the last of them has passed, the first of them will return, on a day that is as long as fifty thousand years, until judgment is passed among the people, and he realizes his end. Any man who has cattle and does not pay what is due on them in drought or in plenty, they will come on the Day of Resurrection as energetic, fat and lively as they ever were. He will be laid face down in a flat arena for them, and they will trample him with their cloven hooves. When the last of them has passed the first of them will return, on a day that is as long as fifty thousand years, until judgment is passed among the people and he realizes his end. Any man who has sheep and does not pay what is due on them in drought or in plenty, they will come on the Day or Resurrection as energetic, fat and lively as they ever were. He will be laid face down in a flat arena for them and they will trample him with their cloven hooves, and each horned one will gore him with its horn, and there will be none among them with twisted or broken horns. When the last of them has passed, the first of them will return, on a day that is as long as fifty thousand years, until judgment is passed among the people, and he realizes his end."' 
2443 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"When the Messenger of Allah died, and Abu Bakr became the Khalifah after him, and some of the 'Arabs reverted to disbelief. 'umar said to Abu Bakr: 'How can you fight the people when the Messenger of allah said: "I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship but Allah). Whoever says La ilaha illah, his wealth and his life safe from me, unless he deserves a legal punishment justly, and his reckoning will be with Allah?"'  Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'I will fight anyone who separates prayer and Zakah; Zakah is the compulsory right to be taken from wealth. By Allah, if they withhold from me a rope that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah, I will fight them for wiholding it.' 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'By Allah, it was as if I saw that Allah has opened the heart of Abu Bakr for fighting, and I knew that I was the truth."' 
2444 | ,Bahz bin Hakim said:"My father told, me that my grandfather said: 'I heard the Prophet say: With regard to grazing camels, for every forty a Bint Labbun (a two-year old female camel). No differentiation is to be made between camels when calculating them. Whoever gives it seeking reward, he will be rewarded for it. Whoever refuses, we will take it, and half of his camels, as one of the rights of our Lord. And it is not permissible for the family of Muhammad to have any of them."' 
2445 | ,It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah said:"No Sadaqah is due on less than five Awsuq,[1] and no Sadaqah is due on less than five Dhawd (head of camel), and no Sadaqah is due on less than five Awaq."[2]

2447 | ,It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that Abu Bakar wrote to them:"This is the obligation of Sadaqah which the Messenger of Allah enjoined upon the Muslims, as Allah , the Mighty and Sublime, commanded the Messenger of Allah .Whoever is asked for it in the manner explained (in the letter of Abu Bakar), let him give it, and whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it. When there are less than twenty-five camels, for every five camels, one sheep (is to be given). If the number reaches twenty five, then a Bint Makhad (a one-year old she-camel) is due, up to thirty-five. If a Bint Makhad is not available, then a Bin Labun (a two-year old male camel). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a Bint Labun (a two-yer-old she-camel) is due, up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a Hiqqqah (a three-year-old she-camel) that has been bred from a stallion camel is due, up to sixty. If the number reaches sixty-one, then a Jadhah (a four-year-old she-camel) is due, up to seventy-six, then two Bint Labuns (two-year-old she-camels0 are due, up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two Hiqqahs (three-year-old she-camels) that have been bred from stallion camels are due, up to one hundred and twenty. If there are more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty a Bint Labun, and for every fifty a Hiqqah. In the event that a person does not have a camel of the age specified according to the Hiaqah regulations, then if a person owes a Jadhah as Sadaqah  but he does not have  a Jadhah, then a Hiqqah should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it if they are available, or twenty Dirhams, If he owes a Hiqqah as Sadaqah and he does not have Hiqqah but he has a Jadhah, then if should be accepted from him, and the Zakah collector should give him twenty Dirhams, or two sheep if they are available. If a person owes a Hiqqah as Sadaqah and he does not have one, but he has a Bint Labun, it should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it if they are available, or twenty Dirhams.

Sheep willcome to their owner in the best state of health that they ever had (in this world) and if he did not pay what was due on them, they will trample him with their cloven hooves and gore him with their horns. And among their rights are that they should be milked with water in the front of them. I do not want any one of you to come on the Day of Resurrection with a groaning camel on his neck, saying , O Muhammad, and I will say: I cannot do anything for you, I conveyed the message. I do not  want any one of you to come on the Day of Resurrection with a bleating sheep on his neck, saying, "O Muhammad," and I will say: "I cannot do anything for you, I conveyed the message." And on the Day of Resurrection the hoarded treasure of one of you will be a blad-headed Shujaa[1]from which its owner will flee, but it will chase him (saying), I am your hoarded treasure, and it will keep (chasing him) until he gives it his finger to swallow."'

And on that day there will be none that are hornless or have broken horns.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what is due on them?' He said: Lending males for breeding, lending their buckets, and giving them to people to ride in the cause of Allah. And there is no owner of wealth who does not give what is due on it but a bald-headed Shujaa[1]will appear to him on the Day of Resurrection; its owner will flee from it and it will chase him and say to him: This is your treasure which you used to hoard. When he realizes that he cannot escape it he will put his hand in its mouth and it will start to bite it as a stallion bites."'

Two men came on a camel and said: We are the messengers of the Messengers of Allah, we come to take the Sadaqah of your sheep. I said: What do I have to give? They said: A sheep. So I went to a sheep that I knew was filled with milk and was fat, and brought it out to them. He said: This is a Shafi - a sheep that has a child or is pregnant - and the Messenger of Allah forbade us to take a Shafi'. So I went to a Mu'tat she-goat - a Mutat is one that has not given birth before, but has reached the age where it could produce young- and brought it out to them. They said: We will take it.

If they obey you in that, then teach them that Allah has enjoined upon them Sadaqah (Zakah) from their wealth, to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they obey you in that, then do not touch the most precious of their wealth, and fear the supplication of the one who has been wronged, for there is no barrier between it and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime." 
2523 | ,Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said:"A man said" 'I am going to give some charity.' So he went out with his charity and put it in the hand of a thief. The next morning they started talking about how charity had been given to a thief. Then he said: 'O Allah, to You be praise for the thief. I am going to give some charity.' So he went out with his charity and put it in the hand of a prostitute. The next morning they started talking about how charity had been given to a prostitute. He said: 'O Allah, to You be praise for the prostitute. I am going to give some charity. So he went out with his charity and put it in the hand of a rich man. The next morning they started talking about how charity had been given to a rich man. He said: 'O Allah, th You be praise for the prostitute, the thief and the rich man. 'Then the message came to him: As for your charity, it is accepted. As for the prostitute, perhaps it will keep her from committing Zina. As for the thief, perhaps it will stop him from stealing. And as for the rich man, perhaps he will learn a lesson, and will spend from that which Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has given him."' 
2524 | ,It was narrated from Abu Al-Malib that his father said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, does not accept prayer without purification or charity from Ghulul." 
2525 | ,Abu Huraiarh said:"The Messenger of Allah said: None gives charity from (wealth earned from) a good source - and Allah does not accept anything but that which is good - but the Most Merciful takes it in His right hand, even if it is a date, and it tended in the hand of the Most Merciful until it becomes grater than a mountain, just as one of you tends his foal or camel calf."'

2528 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'A Dirham was better than a hundred thousand Dirhams.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, how?' He said: 'A man had two Dirhams and gave one in charity, and another man went to part of his wealth and took out a hundred thousand Dirhams and gave them in charity."' 
2529 | ,It was narrated that Abu Mas'ud said:"The Messenger of Allah used to tell us to give in charity, and one of us could not find anything to give until he went to the market place and hired himself out to carry loads for people. Then he would bring a Mudd and give it to the Messenger of Allah. I know a man who has a hundred thousand now, but on that day he had (only) one Dirham." 
2530 | ,It was narrated that Abu Mas 'ud said:"When the Messenger of Allah commanded us to give in charity, Abu 'Aqil give half a Sa', and another man brought much more than that. The hypocrites said: 'Allah has no need of the charity of the former, and the latter only did it to show off. Then the following was revealed: 'Those who defame such of the believers who give charity voluntarily, and such who could not find to give charity except what is available to them."'[1] 
2531 | ,Sa'eed and 'Urwah narrated that they heard Hakim bin Hizam say:"I asked the Messenger of Allah and he gave me, then I asked him and he gave me, then I asked him and he gave me. Then he said: "This wealth is attractive and sweet. Whoever takes it without insisting, it will be blessed for him, and whoever takes it with avarice, it will not be blessed for him. He is like one who eats and is not satisfied. And the upper hand is better than the lower hand."' 
2532 | ,It was narrated that Tariq Al-Muharibi said:"We came to Al-Madinah and the Messenger of Allah was standing on the Minbar addressing the people and saying: 'The hand which gives is the upper hand. Start with those for whom you are responsible; your mother, your father, your sister, your brother, then the next closest, and the next closet."' 
2533 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar that:the Messenger of Allah said, when mentioning charity and those who refrain from asking. "The upper hand is better than the lower hand; the upper hand is that which gives and the lower hand is that which asks."

Then he came on the third Friday, when the Prophet was delivering Khutbah and he said: "Pray two Rak'ahs." Then he said: "Give in charity."  So they gave in charity, and he gave him (that man) two garments. Then he said: "Give in charity" and (that man) threw one of his two garments. The Messenger of Allah said: "Have you not seen this man? He entered the Masjid in scruffy clothes and I hoped that you would notice him, and give charity to him, but you did not do that, So I said, 'Give in charity.' You gave in charity, and I gave him two garments, then I said; 'Give in charity' and he threw one of his two garments. Take your garment." And he rebuked him.

When my master fund out about that, he beat me, so I went to the Messenger of Allah and he came to him and said: 'Do not beat him.' He said: 'He gave away my food without me telling him to.'

The husband will be rewarded for what he earned and she will be rewarded for what she spent." 
2540 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr said:"When the Messenger of Allah conquered Makkah, he stood up to address the people and said in his Khutbah; 'It is not permissible for a woman to give anything without her husband's permission."' (He narrated it) in abridged from.

He said: "The one of you who has the longest arms." They took a stick and started to measure their arms. But Sawdah was the first one to follow him. She was the one who had the longest arms, because she used to give in charity a great deal.

News of that reached the Messenger of Allah and he said: 'Do you have any property besides him?' He said: 'No.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'Who will buy him from me?' Nu'aim bin 'Abdullah Al-Adawi bought him for eight hundred Dirhams. The Messenger of Allah brought it (the money) and gave it to him, then he said: 'Start with yourself and if there is anything left, give it to our family. If there is anything left after your family (has been taken care of), then give it to your relatives. If there is anything left after your relatives (have been taken care of), then (give it) to such and such, saying: 'In front of you and to your right and to your left."' (Shih) 
2547 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah said: "The parable of the one who spends and give in charity, and the one who is miserly, is that of two men wearing coats of mail, with their hands pressed closely to their breasts and their collarbones. When the one who spends wants to give charity, the (coat of mail) expends so much that it covers his fingertips and obliterates his traces. But when the miser wants to give, the (coat of mail) contracts and every ring grips the place where it is, and his hands are tied up to his collarbone."' Abu Hurairah says: 'I swear that he saw the Messenger trying to expand it but it did not." Tawus said: "I heard Abu Hurairah said: "I heard Abu Hurairah illustrating with his hand trying to expand it but it did not." (Sahaih) 
2548 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet said:"The parable of the miser and the one who gives in charity is that of two men wearing coats of mail with their hands tied to their collarbones. Every time the one who gives thinks of giving in charity, the (coat of mail) expands until it obliterates his traces, and every time the miser thinks of giving charity, every circle (of the coat of mail) contracts and sticks to him, and his hand is tied up to his collarbones." I heard the Messenger of Allah say: "He tries to expand it, but he cannot."

The Messenger of Allah said: Do you want that nothing should enter or leave your house without your knowledge? I said: 'Yes.' He said: "Don't be hasty, O 'Aishah. Do not count what you give, otherwise Allah will count what He gives to you."'

Most of them, may all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The face of the Messenger of Allah changed when he saw them in poverty. He went in (to his house) then he came out and ordered Bilah to call the Adhan and then the Iqamah. He (the Prophet) prayed, tjem je addressed te,, (reciting the Verses): 'O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him(Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women: and fear Allah through Whom you demand (your mutual right), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship).  Surely, Allah is Ever and All-Watcher over you.' [1] and: 'Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow,' [2] Then they gave in charity, some giving a Dinar, others a Dirham, or a garment, or a Sa' of wheat or, a Sa' of dates, until he said: 'Even half a date.' A man from among the Ansar came with a bag of money which his hands could hardly lift. The people followed one another (in giving charity) until I saw two heaps of food and clothing, and I saw the face of the Messenger of Allah shining like gold (with joy). The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever sets a good precedent in Islam, he will have the reward for that, and the reward of those who acted in accordance with it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. And whoever sets an evil precedent in Islam, he will have a burden of sin for that, and the burden of those who acted in accordance with it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest."'

2558 | ,It was narrated from Ibn Jabir, from his father, that the Messenger of Allah said:"There is a kind of protective Jealousy that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, loves anda kind that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, hates, and a kind of pride that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, loves and a kind that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, hates, As for the protective jealousy that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, loves, it is protective jealousy when there are grounds for suspicion. As for the protective jealousy that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, hates, it is protective jealousy when there are no grounds for suspicion. As for the pride that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, loves, it is when a man feels proud of himself when fighting and when giving charity. And as for the kind of pride that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, hates, it is pride in doing wrong."

The Messenger of Allah repeated and Abu Dharr said: "May they be lost and doomed." He said: "The one who lets his garment hang beneath his ankles, a vendor who tries to sell his product by means of false oaths, and the one who reminds people of what he has given them." 
2564 | ,It was narrated that Abu Dharr said:"The Messenger of Allah said: "There are three to whom of Allah will not speak on the Day of Resurrection or look at them or purify them, and theirs will be a painful torment: the one who reminds people of what he has given them, the one who lets his garment hang beneath his ankles, and a vendor who tries to sell his product by means of false oaths."

2568 | ,Bahz bin Hakim narrated from his father that his grandfather said:"I said: 'O Prophet of Allah! I did not come to you until I had sworn more that this many times' - the number of fingers on his hands - 'that I would never come to you or follow your religion. I am a man who does not know anything except that which Allah and His Messenger teach me. I ask you by the face of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, with what has your Lord sent you to us? He said: 'With Islam.' I said: What are the signs of Islam? He said; To say: I submit my face to Allah and give up Shirk, and, to establish the Salah and to pay Zakah. Each Muslim is sacred and inviolable to his fellow Muslim; they support one another. Allah does not accept my deed from an idolater after he becomes a Muslim, until he departs from the idolaters and joins the Muslims."' 
2569 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said:"Shall I not tell you of the best of the people in status?" We said: "Yes. O Messenger of Allah!" He said: "A man who rides his horse in the cause of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, until he dies or is killed. Shall I not tell you of the one who comes after him (in status)?" We said: "Yes, O Messenger of Allah!" He said; "A man who withdraws to a mountain pass and establishes Salah, and pays Zakah, and keeps away from the evil of people. Shall I not tell you of the worst of people?" We said: "Yes, O Messenger of Allah!"

2570 | ,It was narrated from Zaid bin Zibyan, and attributed to Abu Dharr, that the Prophet said:"There are three whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, loves, and three whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, hates. As for those whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, loves: A man who comes to some people and asks (to be given something) for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and not for the sake of their relationship, but they do not give him. So one man stayed behind and gave to him in secret, and no one knew of his giving except Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and the one to whom he gave it. People who travel all night until sleep becomes dearer to them than anything that may be equivalent to it, so they lay down their heads (and slept). Then a man among them got up and started praying to Me and beseeching Me, reciting MY Ayat. And a man who was on a campaign and met the enemy and they fled, but he went forward (pursuing them) until he was killed or Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, granted victory to him. And three whom Allah hates are the old man who commits Zina, the poor man who shows off, and the rich man who is unjust." 
2571 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the messenger of Allah said:"The poor man (Miskin) is not the one who leaves if you give him a date or two, or a morsel or two. Rather the poor man is the one who refrains from asking. Recite if you wish: "They do not beg of people at all."' 
2572 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of  Allah said:"The poor man (Miskin) is not the one who goes around asking people and they send him away with a morsel or two, of a date or two.

2575 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah said: "There are three to whom Allah, it Mighty and Sublime, with not speak on the Day of Resurrection: An old man who commits adultery, a poor man who is arrogant, and an Imam who tells lies."'

The Quraish" - he said one time: became angry and said: 'You give to the chiefs of  Najdand that, so as to soften their hearts toward Islam.' Then a man with a thick beard, prominent cheeks, and a shaven head came and said: 'Fear Allah. O Muhammad! He said: 'Who would obey Allah if I disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) He has entrusted me with all the people of the Earth but you do not trust me?' Then the man went away, and a man from among the people, whom they (the narrators) think was Khalid bin Al-Walid, asked for permission to kill him. The Messenger of Allah said: 'Among the offspring of this man will be some people who will recite the Qur'an but it will not go any further than their throats. They will kill the Muslims but leave the idol worshippers alone, and they will passes through Islam as an arrow passes through the body of the target. If I live to see them. I will kill them all, as the people of 'Ad were killed."'

2580 | ,It was narrated that Qubaisah bin Mukhariq said:"I undertook a financial responsibility, then I came to the Prophet and asked him (for help) concerning that. He said: 'Hold on, o Qubaisah! When we get some charity we will give you some.' Then the Messenger of Allah said: 'O Qubaisah, charity is not permissible except for one of three: A man who undertakes a financial responsibility, so it is permissible for him to be given charity until he finds means to make him independent and to suffice him; a man who was stricken by calamity and his wealth was destroyed, so it is permissible for him to ask for help until he has enough to keep him going, them he should refrain from asking; and a man who is stricken with poverty and three wise men from among his own people testily that so-and-so is in desperate need, then it is permissible for him to ask for help until he finds means to make him independent and to suffice him. Asking for help in cases other than these, O Qubaisah, is unlawful, and the one who takes it is consuming it unlawfully."' 
2581 | ,It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri said:"The Messenger of Allah sat on the Minbar, and we sat around him. He said: 'What I fear most for you after I am gone is the (worldly) delights that will come to you.' And he spoke of this world and its attractions. A man said: 'Can good bring forth evil? 'The Messenger of Allah remained silent and it was said to him (that man): 'What is the matter with you? You speak to the Messenger of Allah when he does not speak to you? We noticed that he was receiving Revelation. Then he recovered and wiped off his sweat and said: I know what the questioner meant: he means that good never brings forth evil. But some of that which grows in the spring kills the animals or makes them sick, unless they eat Al-Khadir (kind of plant): if they eat their fill or it then turn to face the sun and then defecate and urinate and start to graze again. This wealth is fresh and sweet. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to a Muslim from which he gives to orphans, the poor and wayfarers. The one who takes it unlawfully is like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and who eats but is never satisfied, and it will be a witness against him on the Day of  Resurrection."'

'Abdullah was not a wealthy man and she said to him: 'Can I spend my charity on you and on my brother's children who are orphans? 'Abdullah said: 'Ask the Messenger of Allah about that.' She said: So I went to the Messenger of Allah, and at his door I found a woman from among the Ansar who was also called Zainab, and she was asking about the same matter as I was. Bilal came out to us and we said to him: Go to the Messenger of Allah and ask him about that, but do not tell him who we are. He went to the Messenger of Allah and he said:' Who are they?' He said: Zainab.' He said: 'Which Zainab?" He said: 'Zainab Al-Ansariyyah.' Abdullah and Zainab Al-Ansariyyah.' He said: 'Yes, they will have two rewards, the reward for upholding the ties of kinship and the reward dfor giving charity."' 
2584 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'if one of you were to carry a bundle of firewood on his back and sell it, that would be better than asking a man who may or may not give him something."'

3092 | ,It was narrated from 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Utbah bin Mas'ud that Abu Hurairah said:"When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died and Abu Bakr (was appointed Khalifah) after him, and some of the 'Arabs disbelieved, 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'O Abu Bakr, how can you fight the people when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship except Allah.) Whoever says La ilaha illallah, his life and his property are safe from me, except for its right, and his reckoning will be with Allah?'" Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "I will surely fight those who separate prayer and Zakah, for Zakah is what is due on wealth. By Allah, if they withhold from me a small she-goat that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) I will fight them for withholding it.' ('Umar said) 'By Allah, when I realized that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, had opened the chest of Abu Bakr to fighting, then I knew that it was the truth.'" The wording is that of Ahmad. 
3093 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"When Abu Bakr mobilized to fight them, 'Umar said: 'O Abu Bakr, how can you fight the people when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy or worship except Allah). Whoever says La ilaha illallah, his life and his property are safe from me, except for its right, and his reckoning will be with Allah?'" Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with me him, said: 'By Allah, I will surely fight those who separate prayer and Zakah, for Zakah is what is due on wealth. By Allah, if they withhold from me a small she-goat that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) I will fight them for withholding it.' ('Umar said) 'By Allah, when I realized that Allah, the Most High, had opened the chest of Abu Bakr to fighting them, then I knew that it was the truth.'" 
3094 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, some of the 'Arabs apostatized. 'Umar said: 'O Abu Bakr, how can you fight the 'Arabs? Abu Bakr said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I have been commanded to fight the people until they testify that La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship except Allah) and that I am the Messenger of Allah, and establish prayer and pay Zakah?' By Allah, if they withhold from me a small she-goat that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) I will fight them for withholding it.' ('Umar siad) 'By Allah, when I realized that (Abu) Bakr was confident about this idea, then I knew that this was teh truth.'" Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: 'Imran Al Qattan is not strong in Hadith, and this narration is a mistake. The one that is before it is the correct narration of Az-Zuhri, from 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Utbah, from Abu Hurairah. 
3095 | ,Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (there is non worthy or worship except Allah). Whoever says it, his life and his property are safe from me, except for its right, and his reckoning will be with Allah." 
3096 | ,It was narrated from Anas that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Strive against the idolators with your wealth, your hands and your tongues." [1]  [1] Its chain has defects while its meaning is supported by other chains. 
3097 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy." 
3098 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'By the One in Whose hand is my soul, were it not for the fact that there are some believing men who would not feel happy to stay behind (when I go out on a campaign) and I do not have the means to provide them with mounts (so that they cn join me), I would not have stayed behind from any campaign or battle in the cause of Allah. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I wish that I could be killed in the cause of Allah, then brought back to life, then be killed, then be brought back to life, then be killed then be brought back to life, then be killed.'" 
3099 | ,It was narrated that Sahl bin Sa'd said:"I saw Marwan bin Al-Hakam sitting and I came and sat with him. He told us that Zaid bin Thabit told him, that the following was revealed to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ): (Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home) and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah), then Ibn Umm Maktum came when he was dictating it to me (Zaid), and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! If I were able to go for Jihad I would go out for Jihad.' Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed to him - while his thigh was against mine, and became so heavy that I thought my thigh would break, until (the revelation) stopped -: 'Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame).'" [1] Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: This 'Abdur-Rahman bin Ishaq is tolerable, while 'Abdur-Rahman bin IShaq, from whom reports 'Ali bin Mushir, abu Mu'awiyah, and 'Abdul-Wahid bin Ziyad from An-Nu'man bin Sa'd - he is not trustworthy.  [1] An-Nisa' 4:95. 
3100 | ,It was narrated that Ibn Shihab said:"Sahl bin Sa'd said: 'I saw Marwan sitting in the Masjid so I went and sat beside him, and he told us that Zaid bin Thabit had told him, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) dictated to him the words: [Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home) and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah]. Then Ibn umm Maktum came to him while he was dictating it to me (Zaid) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! If I were able to go for Jihad I would go out for Jihad.' But he was a blind man. Then Allah revealed to His Messenger (ﷺ) - while his thigh was agaisnt my thigh, and (it became so heavy that) I thought my thigh would break, then it was lifted from him, and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: 'Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame).'" [1]  [1] An-Nisa' 4:95. 
3101 | ,It was narrated from Al-Bara' that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"bring me a shoulder blade of a camel, or a tablet, and write: Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home)." [1] 'Amr bin Umm Maktum was behind him and he said: "Is there a concession for me?" Then the following was revealed: "Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame)." [2]  [1] An-Nisa' 4:95. [2] An-Nisa' 4:95. 
3102 | ,It was narrated that Al-Bara' said:"When the following was revealed: 'Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home),' [1] Ibn Umm Maktum, who was blind, came and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what about me? I am blind.' He said: 'He did not leave before the following was revealed: Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame).'" [2]  [1] An-Nisa' 4:95. [2] An-Nisa' 4:95. 
3103 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr said:"A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him for permission to go for Jihad. He said: 'Are your parents alive?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Then strive for their sake.'" 
3104 | ,It was narrated from Mu'awiyah bin Jahimah As-Sulami, that Jahimah came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said:"O Messenger of Allah!

3105 | ,It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri that a man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said:"O Messenger of Allah! Which of the people is best?" He said: "One who strives with himself and his wealth in the cause of Allah." He said: "Then who, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "Then a believer (isolating himself) in one of the mountain passes, who fears Allah and spares the people his evil." 
3106 | ,It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri said:"in the year of Tabuk, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed the people, while leaning against his mount. He said: 'Shall I not tell you of the best of the people and the worst of the people? Among the best of the people is a man who strives in the cause of Allah on the back of his horse, or on the back of his camel, or on his own two feet, until death comes to him. And among the worst of the people, is an immoral man (Fajir) who reads the Book of Allah but he does not refrain from doing anything bad because of it.'" 
3107 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"No man who weeps for fear of Allah will be touched by the Fire until the milk goes back into the udders. And the dust (of Jihad) in the cause of Allah and the smoke of Hell, will never be combined in the nostrils of a Muslim." 
3108 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"No man will enter the Fire who weeps for fear of Allah, Most High, until the milk goes back into the udders. And the dust (of Jihad) in the cause of Allah, and the smoke of Hell will never be combined." 
3109 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Two will never be gathered together in the Fire: A Muslim who killed a disbeliever then tried his best and did not deviate. And two will never be gathered together in the lungs of a believer: Dust in the cause of Allah, and the odor of Hell. And two will never be gathered in the heart of a salve: Faith and envy." 
3110 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The dust in the cause of Allah and the smoke of Hell will never be combined in the lungs of a slave, and the stinginess and faith can never be combined in a slave's heart."

3116 | ,Yazid bin Abi Mariam said:"Abayah bin Rafi' met me when I was walking to Friday prayers, and he said: 'Rejoice, for these steps you are taking are in the cause of Allah.

3117 | ,Abu 'Ali At-Tujibi (said) that he heard Abu Raihanah say:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'The eye that stays awake in the cause of Allah will be forbidden to the Fire.'" 
3118 | ,It was narrated that Sahl bin Sa'd said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Going out before noon or after noon, in the cause of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is better than this world and everything in it.'" 
3119 | ,It was narrated from Abu 'Abdur-Rahman Al-Hubuli that he heard Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari say:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Going out before noon and after noon, in the cause of Allah, is better than everything on which the sun rises and sets.'" 
3120 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"There are three, all of whom have a promise of help from Allah: 'The Mujahid who strives in the cause of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime; the man who gets married, seeking to keep himself chaste; and the slave who has a contract of manumission and wants to buy his freedom.'" 
3121 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The guests of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, are three: The warrior, the pilgrim performing Hajj, and the pilgrim performing 'Umrah.'" 
3122 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has guaranteed to the one who strives in His cause, only going out for Jihad in His cause, and believing in His Word, that He will admit him to Paradise, or bring him back to his home from which he emerged, with whatever he has earned of reward, or spoils of war." 
3123 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'Allah has guaranteed: 'For the one who goes out in the cause of Allah, and nothing makes him do that except faith in Me, and Jihad in My cause - that He will admit him to Paradise whether he is killed or he dies, or He will return him to his home from which he departed with whatever he has earned of reward or spoils of war.'" 
3124 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'The parable of Mujahid (who strives in the cause of Allah) - and Allah knows best who strives in teh cause of Allah - is that of one who fasts and prays Qiyam (continually). Allah has promised Mujahid (who strives in His cause), that He will either cause him to die and admit him to paradise, or, He will bring him back safely with whatever he had earned of reward or spoils of war.'" 
3125 | ,'Abdullah bin 'Amr said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'There is no raiding party that goes out in the cause of Allah and acquires some spoils of war, but they have been given two-thirds of their reward in this world instead of in the Hereafter, and there remains one-third (in the Hereafter). And if they do not acquire any spoils of war, then all of their reward (will come in the Hereafter).'" 
3126 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar, from the Prophet (ﷺ), of what he related from his Lord, the Mighty and Sublime:"And of My slaves who goes out as a Mujahid striving in the cause of Allah, seeking my pleasure, I guarantee that I will bring him back with whatever he had earned as reward or spoils of war, and if I take his (soul) I will forgive him and have mercy on him." 
3127 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'The parable of a Mujahid who strives in the cause of Allah - and Allah knows best who in His cause - is that of one who fasts, prays Qiyam, focuses with proper humility, bows and prostrates.'" 
3128 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'Tell me of an action that is equal to Jihad.' He said: 'I cannot. When the Mujahid goes out, can you enter the Masjid and stand in prayer and never rest, and fast and never break your fast?' He said: 'Who can do that?'"

3131 | ,It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"O Abu Sa'eed! Whoever is content with Allah as Lord, Islam as his religion and Muhammad as Prophet, then he is guaranteed Paradise." Abu Sa'eed found this amazing and said: "Say it to me again, O Messenger of Allah." So he did that, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "And there is something else by means of which a person may be raised one hundred degrees in Paradise, each of which is like that which is between the Heaven and the Earth." He said: "What is it, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "Jihad in the cause of Allah, Jihad in the cause of Allah." 
3132 | ,It was narrated that Abu Ad-Darda' said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever established Salah, pays Zakah, and dies not associating anything with Allah, he has a right from Allah the Mighty and Sublime, that He will forgive him, whether he emigrated, or died in his birthplace.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Shall we not tell the people about it so that they may rejoice?' He said: 'In Paradise there are one hundred levels, (the distance) between each two of which is like (the distance) between the Heaven and the Earth; Allah has prepared them fro the Mujahidin who strive in His cause. Were it not that it would be too difficult for the believers and I cannot find mounts for them - and they do not like to stay behind if I go out (on a campaign) - I would not have stayed behind from any expedition. I wish that I could be killed then brought back to life, then killed again.'" 
3133 | ,It was narrated from 'Amr bin Malik Al-Janbi that he heard Fadalah bin 'Ubaid say:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'I am a Za'im - and the Za'im is the guarantor - for the one who believes in me and accepts Islam, and emigrates: A house on the outskirts of Paradise and a house in the middle of Paradise. And I am a guarantor, for the one who believes in me and accepts Islam, and strives in the cause of Allah: A house on the outskirts of Paradise and a house in the middle of Paradise and a house in the highest chambers of Paradise. Whoever does that and seeks goodness wherever it is, and avoids evil wherever it is, may die wherever he wants to die.'" 
3134 | ,It was narrated that Sabrah bin Abi Fakih said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'the Shaitan sits in the paths of the son of Adam. He sits waiting for him, in the path to Islam, and he says: Will you accept Islam, and leave your religion, and the religion of your forefathers? But he disobeys him and accepts Islam. Then he sits waiting for him, on the path to emigration, and he says: Will you emigrate and leave behind your land and sky? The one who emigrates is like a horse tethered to a peg. But he disobeys him and emigrates. Then he sits, waiting for him, on the path to Jihad, and he says: Will you fight in Jihad when it will cost you your life and your wealth? You will fight and be killed, and your wife will remarry, and your wealth will be divided. But he disobeys him and fights in Jihad.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever does that, then he had a right from Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, that He will admit him to paradise. Whoever is killed, he has a right from Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, that He will admit him to Paradise. If he is drowned, he has a right from Allah that He will admit him to paradise, or whoever is thrown by his mount and his neck is broken, he had a right from Allah that he will admit him to Paradise.'" 
3135 | ,Abu Hurairah used to narrate that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Whoever spends on a pair (of things) in the cause of Allah, he will be called in Paradise: 'O slave of Allah, here is prosperity.' Whoever is one of those who pray, he will be called from the gate of Paradise. Whoever is one of those who participated in Jihad, he will be called from the gate of Paradise. Whoever is one of those who fast, he will be called from the gate of Ar-Rayyan." Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said: "O Messenger of Allah! No distress, or need will befall the one who is called from those gates. Will there be anyone who will be called from all these gates? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Yes, and I hope that you will be one of them." 
3136 | ,Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari said:"A Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'A man fights for fame, or he fights for the spoils of war, or he fights to show off. Who is the one who is fighting in the cause of Allah?' He said: 'The one who fights so that the word of Allah will be supreme is the one who is fighting in the cause of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.'" 
3137 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah, that one of the people of Ash-Sham said to him:"O Shaikh, tell me of a Hadith that you heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)." (He said: "Yes; I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)) say: 'The first of people for whom judgment will be passed on the Day of Resurrection are three. A man who was martyred. He will be brought and Allah will remind him of His blessings and he will acknowledge them. He will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I fought for Your sake until I was martyred. He will say: You are lying. You fought so that it would be said that so-and-so is brave, and it was said. Then He will order that he be dragged on his face and thrown into the Fire. And (the second will be) a man who acquired knowledge and taught others,and read Qur'an. He will be brought, and Allah will remind him of His blessings, and he will acknowledge them. He will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I acquired knowledge and taught others, and read the Qur'an for Your sake. He will say: You are lying. You acquired knowledge so that it would be said that you were a scholar; and you read Qur'an so that it would be said that you were a reciter, and it was said. Then He will order that he be dragged on his face and thrown into the Fire. And (the third will be) a man whom Allah made rich and gave him all kinds of wealth. He will be brought and Allah will remind him of His blessings, and he will acknowledge them. he will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I did not leave any way that You like wealth to be spent - Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: I did not understand "what You like" as I wanted to [1] - "but I spent it." He will say: "You are lying. You spent it so that it would be said that he was generous, and it was said." Then he will order that he be dragged on his face and thrown into the Fire.'"  [1] That is, he did not hear or understand what came after it as well as he wanted to, but it was similar to what follows regarding the spending. Similar was stated by Shaikh 'Abdur-Rahman Al-punjani in his notes on the text, according to Al-Funjani in his commentary At-Ta'iqat As-Salafiyyah (2:51) 
3138 | ,It was narrated from Yahya bin Al-Walid bin 'Ubadah bin As-Samit that his grandfather said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever fights in the cause of Allah intending only to get an 'Iqal, he will have what he intended." 
3139 | ,It was narrated from 'Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:"Whoever fights seeking only an 'Iqbal, then he will have what he intended." 
3140 | ,It was narrated that Abu 'Umamah Al-Bahili said:"A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: 'What do you think of a man who fights seeking reward and fame - what will he have?' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'He will not have anything.' He repeated it three times, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: 'He will not have anything.' Then he said: 'Allah does not accept any deed, except that which is purely for Him, and seeking His Face.'" 
3141 | ,Mu'adh bin Jabal said that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say:"Whoever fights in the cause of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, for the length of time between two milkings of a she-camel, Paradise is guaranteed for him. Whoever asks Allah to be killed (in Jihad) sincerely, from his heart, then he dies or is killed, he will have the reward of a martyr. Whoever is wounded or injured in the cause of Allah, it will come on the Day of Resurrection bleeding the most it ever bled, but its color will be like saffron, and its fragrance will be like musk. Whoever is wounded in the cause of Allah, upon him is the seal of the martyrs." 
3142 | ,It was narrated from Shurahbil bin As-Simt that he said to 'Amr bin 'Abasah:"O 'Amr! Tell us a Hadith that you heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)." He said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'Whoever develops one gray hair in the cause of Allah, Most High, it will be light for him on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever shoots an arrow in the cause of Allah, Most High, whether it reaches the enemy or not, it will be as if he freed a slave. Whoever frees a believing slave, it will be a ransom for him from the Fire, limb by limb.'" 
3143 | ,It was narrated that Abu Najih As-Sulami said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'Whoever shoots an arrow in the cause of Allah and it hits the target, it will raise him one level in Paradise.' That day I shot sixteen arrows that hit their targets." He said: "And I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'Whoever shoots an arrow in the cause of Allah, it is equal to the reward of freeing a slave.'" 
3144 | ,It was narrated that Shurahbil bin As-Simt said to Ka'b bin Murrah:"O Ka'b! Tell us a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and be careful." He said: "I heard him say: 'Whoever develops one gray hair in Islam, in the cause of Allah, it will be light for him on the Day of Resurrection.'" He said to him: "Tell us about the Prophet (ﷺ) and be careful." He said: "I heard him say: 'Shoot, and whoever hits the enemy with an arrow, Allah will raise him one degree in status thereby.'" Ibn An-Nahhan said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what is a degree?' He said: 'It is not like the doorstep of your mother; [1] rather (the distance) between two degrees is (that if) a hundred years.'"  [1] As explained after it; the degree of distance is greater than such a degree in this world. 
3145 | ,It was narrated that Shurahbil bin As-Simt said:"I said: 'O 'Amr bin 'Abasah! Tell us a Hadith that you heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) without forgetting or omitting anything.' He said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Whoever shoots an arrow in the cause of Allah, and it reaches the enemy, whether it misses or hits, it will be as if he freed slave. Whoever frees a believing slave, that will be a ransom for him, limb by limb, from the Fire of Hell. Whoever develops a gray hair in the cause of Allah, it will be light for him on the Day of Resurrection." 
3146 | ,It was narrated from 'Uqbah bin 'Amir that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will admit three people into Paradise for one arrow: The one who makes it, intending it to be used for a good cause, the one who shoots it, and one who passes it to him." 
3147 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:"No one is wounded in the cause of Allah - and Allah knows best who is wounded in His cause - but he will come on the Day of Resurrection with his wounds bleeding the color of blood, but with the fragrance of musk." 
3148 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin Tha'labah said:"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Wrap them up with their blood, for there is no wound incurred in the cause of Allah, but he will come on the Day of Resurrection bleeding with the color of blood, but its fragrance will be that of musk.'" 
3149 | ,It was narrated that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:"On the day of Uhud, the people ran away, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in one position among twelve men of the Ansar, one of whom was Talhah bin 'Ubaidullah. He said: 'Who will face the people?' Talhah said: 'I will.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Stay where you are.' One of the Ansar said: 'I will, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' He said: 'You (go ahead).' So he fought until he was killed. Then he turned and saw the idolators. He said: 'Who will face the people?' Talhah said: 'I will'. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Stay where you are.' One of the Ansar said: 'I will, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' He said: 'You (go ahead).' So he fought until he was killed. This carried on, and each man of the Ansar went out to face them and fought like the one before him, and was killed, until only the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Talhah bin 'Ubaidullah were left. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Who will face the people?' Talhah said: 'I will.' So Talhah fought like the eleven before him, until his hand was struck, and his fingers were cut off, and he exclaimed in pain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'If you had said Bismillah (in the Name of Allah), the angels would have lifted you up with the people looking on.' Then Allah drove back the idolators." 
3150 | ,Salamah bin Al-Akwa' said:"On the day of Khaibar, my brother fought fiercely alongside the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), then his sword recoiled upon him and killed him. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), complaining about that, said: 'A man has died by his own weapon.'" Salamah said: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned from Khaibar and I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, do you permit me to recite some lines of Rajaz verse to you?' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave him permission but 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Think what you are saying." "I said: 'By Allah, if Allah had not guided us we would not have been guided  We would not have given in charity nor prayed'  The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'You have spoken the truth.' (I continued:)  'Send down tranquility upon us, And make us steadfast when we meet the enemy.  For the idolators have transgressed against us.'  When I completed my Rajaz verse, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Who said that?' I said: 'My brother.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'May Allah have mercy on him.'

Ans He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower' And another third of the rock broke off and there was another flash of light, which Salman saw. Then he struck (the rock) a third time and said: 'And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.' The last third fell, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out, picked up his Rida' and sat down. Salman said: 'O Messenger of Allah, Each time you struck the rock there was a flash of light.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: 'O Salman, did you see that?' He said: 'Yes, by the One Who sent you with the truth, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'When I struck the first blow, the cities of Kisra and their environs were shown to me, and many other cities, and I saw them with my own eyes.' Those of his Companions who were present said: 'O Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to grant us victory and to give us their land as spoils of war, and to destroy their lands at our hands.'

He said: "I know Surah such-and-such, and Surah such-and-such," and listed them. He said: "Can you recite them by heart?" He said: "Yes."

3346 | ,'Urwah bin Az-Zubair narrated that he asked 'Aishah about the saying of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime:"And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice." She said: "O son of my sister, this refers to a female orphan who is in the care of her guardian, and her wealth is joined to his, and he is attracted to her wealth and her beauty. So her guardian wants to marry her without being fair with regard to her dowry, and without giving her what someone else would give her. So they were forbidden to marry them unless they were fair to them and gave them the highest possible dowry that is customarily given, and they were commanded to marry other women of their choice."  'Urwah said: "'Aishah said: 'Then later on, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed concerning them: 'They ask your legal instruction concerning women, say: Allah instructs you about them, and about what is recited unto you in the Book concerning the orphan girls whom you give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you desire to marry.' 'Aishah said: 'What Allah, Most High, mentioned here that is recited in the Book is the first Verse in which it says: And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice.' 'Aishah said: 'What is referred to in the other Verse -and yet whom you desire to marry- is the desire of one of you not to marry orphan girl who is under his care if she is lacking in wealth and beauty. So they were forbidden to marry those orphan women to whose wealth they were attracted unless they were fair, because of their desire not to marry (those who were lacking in wealth and beauty.)'" 
3347 | ,It was narrated that Abu Salamah said:"I asked 'Aishah about that and she said: 'The Messenger of Allah got married (and married his daughters) for twelve Uqiyah and a Nashsh'" which is five hundred Dirhams. 
3348 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The dowry, when the Messenger of Allah was among us, was ten Awaq." 
3349 | ,It was narrated that Abu Al-'Ajfa' said:"Umar bin Al-Khattab said: 'Do not go to extremes with regard to the dowries of women, for if that were a sign of honor and dignity in this world, or a sign of piety before Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, then Muhammad would have done that before you. But he did not give any of his wives, and none of his daughters were given, more than twelve Uqiyyah. A man may increase the dowry until he feels resentment against her and says: You cost me everything I own ('Alaqul-Qirbah)'" "And I was a man born among the 'Arabs, but I did not know the meaning of 'Alaqul-Qirbah' and others of you are saying -about those killed in this or that battle of yours, or who died: 'So-and-so was martyred' or 'so and so died as a martyr.' While perhaps he merely overloaded the backside of his beast, or lined his saddle with gold or silver seeking trade. So do not say that, rather say as the Prophet said: 'Whoever is killed in the cause of Allah, or dies, then he is in Paradise.'" 
3350 | ,It was narrated from Umm Habibah that the Messenger of Allah married her when she was in Ethiopia. An-NajaShi performed the marriage for her and gave her a dowry of four thousand, and he fitted her out from his own wealth, and sent her with Shurahbil bin Hasanah.

The Messenger of Allah asked him (about that) and he told him that he had married a woman from among the Ansar. The Messenger of Allah said:"How much did you give her?" He said: "A Nawah (five Dirhams) of gold." The Messenger of Allah said: "Give a Walimah (wedding feast) even if it is with one sheep." 
3352 | ,'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf said:"The Messenger of Allah saw me looking cheerful as I had just got married." I said: "I have gotten married to a woman of the Ansar." He said: "How much did you give her as a dowry?" He said: "A Nawah (five Dirhams) of gold." 
3353 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Amr:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whatever is given as a dowry, or gift or is promised her before the marriage belongs to her. Whatever is given after the marriage belongs to the one to whom it was given. And the most deserving for which a (man) is to be honored is (when marrying off) his daughter or sister.'" This is the wording of 'Abdullah (one of the narrators). 
3354 | ,It was narrated that 'Alqamah and Al-Aswad said:"A man was brought to 'Abdullah who had married a woman without naming a dowry for her, then he died before consummating the marriage with her.

He said: 'I will say what I think, and if it is correct then it is from Allah. She should have a dowry like that of her peers and no less, with no injustice, and she may inherit from him, and she has to observe the 'Iddah.' A man from Ashja' stood up and said: "The Messenger of Allah passed a similar judgment among us concerning a woman called Birwa' bint Washiq. She married a man who died before consummating the marriage with her, and the Messenger of Allah ruled that she should be given a dowry like that of her peers, and she could inherit, and she had to observe the 'Iddah.' 'Abdullah raised his hands and said the Takbir." 
3355 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah that a woman was brought to him who had married a man then he had died without naming any dowry for her and without consummating the marriage with her. They kept coming to him for nearly a month, and he did not issue any ruling to them. Then he said:"I think that she should have a dowry like that of her peers no less, with no injustice and she may inherit from him and she has to observe the 'Iddah."

3437 | ,It was narrated that 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:"Actions are but by intentions, and each man will have but that which he intended. Whoever emigrated for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, his emigration was for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, and whoever emigrated for the sake of some worldly gain or to marry some woman, his emigration was for that for which he emigrated." 
3438 | ,Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said:"Look at how Allah diverts the insults and curses of Quraish from me. They insult 'Mudhammam' and curse 'Mudhammam' -but I am Muhammad."

She said: "He knew that my parents would never tell me to leave him." She said: "Then he recited this Verse: 'O Prophet! Say to your wives: If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner.' I said: 'Do I need to consult my parents concerning this? I desire Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and His Messenger, and the home of the Hereafter.'"

3447 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah, the wife of the Prophet, said:Three Sunan were established because of Barirah. One of those Sunan was that she was set free and was given the choice concerning her husband; the Messenger of Allah said: 'Al Wala' is to the one who set the slave free;' and the Messenger of Allah entered when some meat was being cooked in a pot, but bread and some condiments were brought to him. He said: 'Do I not see a pot in which some meat is being cooked?' They said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah, that is meat that was given in charity to Barirah and you do not eat (food given in) charity.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'It is charity for her and a gift for us.' 
3448 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Three judgments were established because of Barirah. Her masters wanted to sell her but they stipulated that Al-Wala should still be to them. I mentioned that to the Prophet and he said: 'Buy her and set her free, for Al-Wala, is to the one who sets the slave free.' She was set free and the Messenger of Allah gave her the choice, and she chose herself. And she used to be given charity and she would give some of it as a gift to us. I mentioned that to the Prophet and he said: 'Eat it for it is charity for her and a gift for us.'" 
3449 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"I bought Barirah and her masters stipulated that her Wala' should go to them. I mentioned that to the Prophet and he said: 'Set her free, and Al-Wala' is to the one who pays the silver.' So I set her free and the Messenger of Allah called her and gave her the choice concerning her husband. She said: 'Even if you gave me such and such, I would not stay with him,' so she chose herself and her husband was a free man." 
3450 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that she wanted to buy Barirah, but her masters stipulated that her Wala' should go to them. She mentioned that to the Prophet and he said:"Buy her and set her free, for Al-Wala' is to the one who sets the slave free." Some meat was brought and it was said: "This is some of that which was given in charity to Barirah." He said: "It is charity for her and a gift for us." And the Messenger of Allah gave her the choice, and her husband was a free man. 
3451 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Barirah made a contract that she would be freed in return for nine Awaq, one Uqiyyah to be paid each year." She came to 'Aishah asking for help and she said: "No, not unless they agree to accept the sum in one payment, and that the Wala' will go to me." Barirah went and spoke to her masters but they insisted that the Wala' should be for them. She came to 'Aishah and the Messenger of Allah came, and she told her what her masters had said. She said: "No, by Allah, not unless Wala' is to me." The Messenger of Allah said: "What is this?" She said: "O Messenger of Allah, Barirah came to me and asked me to help her with her contract of manumission, and I said no, not unless they agree to accept the sum in one payment, and that the Wala' will be for me. She mentioned that to her masters and they insisted that the Wala' should be for them." The Messenger of Allah said: "Buy her, and stipulate that the Wala' is for the one who sets the slave free." Then he stood up and addressed the people and said: "What is the matter with people who stipulate conditions that are not in the Book of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime? They say: 'I set so-and-so free but the Wala' will be to me.' Every condition that is not in the Book of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is a false condition, even if there are a hundred conditions." And the Messenger of Allah gave her the choice with regard to her husband who was still a slave, and she chose herself. 'Urwah said: "If he had been free the Messenger of Allah would not have given her the choice." 
3452 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said:"The husband of Barirah was a slave." 
3453 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that she bought Barirah from some of the Ansar who stipulated that her Wala' should go to them. The Messenger of Allah said:"Al-Wala' is to the one who did the favor (of setting the slave free)." The Messenger of Allah gave her the choice, as her husband was a slave. And she gave some meat to 'Aishah as a gift, and the Messenger of Allah said: "Why don't you give me some of this meat?" 'Aishah said: "It was given in charity to Barirah." He said: "It is a charity for her, and a gift for us." 
3454 | ,Yahya bin Abi Bukair Al-Karmani said:"Shu'bah narrated to us, from 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim, from his father, from 'Aishah. He (Shu'bah) said: "And he ('Abdur-Rahman) was the executor for his father." He (Shu'bah) said: "I was afraid to say to him: 'Did you hear this from your father.'" -- 'Aishah said: "I asked the Messenger of Allah about Barirah, as I wanted to buy her but it was stipulated that the Wala' would go to her (former) masters. He said: 'Buy her, for the Wala' is to the one who sets the slave free.' And she was given the choice, as her husband was a slave." Then he said, after that: "I do not know." --"And some meat was brought to the Messenger of Allah and they said: 'This is some of that which was given in charity to Barirah.' He said: 'It is charity for her and a gift for us.'" 
3455 | ,Ibn 'Abbas said:"One morning, we saw the wives of the Prophet weeping, and each one of them had her family with her. I entered the Masjid and found it filled with people. Then 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, came, and went to the Prophet who was in his room. He greeted him with the Salam but no one answered. He greeted him again but no one answered. He greeted him (a third time) but no one answered. So he went back and called out: 'Bilal!' He came to the Prophet and said: 'Have you divorced your wives?' He said: 'No, but I have sworn an oath of abstention from them for a month.' So he stayed away from them for twenty-nine days, then he came and went into his wives." 
3456 | ,It was narrated that Anas said:"The Prophet swore an oath of abstention from his wives for a month and stayed in his room for twenty-nine days. It was said: 'O Messenger of Allah, did you not swear an oath of abstention for a month?' He said: 'This month is twenty-nine days.'" 
3457 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that a man came to the Prophet who had declared Zihar from his wife, then he had intercourse with her. He said:"O Messenger of Allah, I declared Zihar on my wife, then I had intercourse with her before I offered the expiation." He said: "What made you do that, may Allah have mercy on you?" He said: "I saw her anklets in the light of the moon." He said: "Do not approach her until you have done that which Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has commanded." 
3458 | ,It was narrated that 'Ikrimah said:"A man declared Zihar to his wife, then had intercourse with her before he had offered the expiation. He mentioned that to the Prophet. The Prophet said to him: 'What made you do that?' He said: 'May Allah have mercy on you, O Messenger of Allah. I saw her anklets, or her calves, in the light of the moon.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'Keep away from her until you have done that which Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has commanded.'" 
3459 | ,'Ikrimah said:"A man came to the Prophet of Allah and said: 'O Prophet of Allah,' and that he had declared Zihar to his wife, then he had intercourse with her before he did what he had to do. He said: 'What made you do that?' He said: 'O Prophet of Allah! I saw the whiteness of her calves in the moonlight.' The Prophet said: 'Keep away until you have done what you have to do.' (One of the narrators) Ishaq said in his Hadith: "Keep away from her until you have done what you have to do." The wording is that of Muhammad. 
3460 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that she said:"Praise be to Allah Whose hearing encompasses all voices. Khawlah came to the Messenger of Allah complaining about her husband, but I could not hear what she said. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: 'Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband, and complains to Allah. And Allah hears the argument between you both.'" 
3461 | ,It was narrated from Ayyub, from Al-Hasan, from Abu Hurairah, that the Prophet said:"Women who seek divorce and Khul' are like the female hypocrites." Al-Hasan said: "I did not hear it from anyone other than Abu Hurairah." 
3462 | ,It was narrated from Yahya bin Sa'eed, from 'Amrah bint 'Abdur-Rahman, that she told him about Habibah bint Sahl:"She was married to Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas. The Messenger of Allah went out to pray As-Subh and he found Habibah bint Sahl at his door at the end of the night. The Messenger of Allah said: 'Who is this?' She said: 'I am Habibah bint Sahl, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'What is the matter?' She said: 'I cannot live with Thabit bin Qais' -her husband. When Thabit bin Qais came, the Messenger of Allah said to him: 'Here is Habibah bint Sahl and she has said what Allah willed she should say.' Habibah said: 'O Messenger of Allah, everything that he gave me is with me.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'Take it from her.' So he took it from her and she stayed with her family." 
3463 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the wife of Thabit bin Qais came to the Prophet and said:"O Messenger of Allah, I do not find any fault with Thabit bin Qais regarding his attitude or religious commitment, but I hate Kufr after becoming Muslim." The Messenger of Allah said: "Will you give him back his garden?" She said: "Yes." The Messenger of Allah said: "Take back the garden and divorce her once." 
3464 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"A man came to the Messenger of Allah and said: 'My wife does not object if anyone touches her.' He said: 'Divorce her if you wish.' He said: 'I am afraid that I will miss her.' He said: 'Then stay with her as much as you need to.'" 
3465 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that a man said:"O Messenger of Allah, I have a wife who does not object if anyone touches her." He said: "Divorce her." He said: "I cannot live without her." He said: "Then keep her." 
3466 | ,It was narrated from Sahl bin Sa'd, from 'Asim bin 'Adiyy who said:"Uwaimir, a man from Banu 'Ajlan, came and said: 'O 'Asim, what do you think if a man sees another man with his wife, should he kill him and be killed in retaliation, or what should he do? O 'Asim, ask the Messenger of Allah about that for me.'" So 'Asim asked the Messenger of Allah about that, and the Messenger of Allah disapproved of the question and criticized the asking of too many questions. Then 'Uwaimir came to him and said: "What happened, O 'Asim?" 'Asim said to 'Uwaimir: "What happened?! You have not brought me any good. The Messenger of Allah disapproved of the question I asked." 'Uwaimir said: "By Allah, I will go and ask the Messenger of Allah." So he went to the Messenger of Allah and asked him. The Messenger of Allah said: "Allah the Mighty and Sublime has revealed (something) concerning you and your wife, so bring her here." Sahl said: "I was among the people in the presence of the Messenger of Allah and he brought her and they engaged in the procedure of Li'an. He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, by Allah! If I keep her I would have been telling lies about her.' So he parted from her before the Messenger of Allah told him to separate from her, and that became the way of Li'an." 
3467 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"The Messenger of Allah conducted the procedure of Li'an between the 'Ajlani and his wife, who was pregnant." 
3468 | ,It was narrated that Muhammad said:"I asked Anas bin Malik about that, as I thought that he had knowledge of that. He said: 'Hilal bin Umayyah accused his wife (of committing adultery) with Sharik bin As-Sahma', who was the brother of Al-Bara' bin Malik through his mother. He was the first one who engaged in the procedure of Li'an. The Messenger of Allah conducted the procedure of Li'an between them, then he said: "Look and see, if she produces a child who is white, with straight hair and Qadiy'a eyes, then he belongs to Hilal bin Umayyah, and if she produces a child who has dark lines around his eyes, curly hair and narrow calves, then he belongs to Sharik bin As-Sahma'." I was told that she produced a child who has dark lines around his eyes, curly hair and narrow calves.'" 
3469 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"The first Li'an in Islam was when Hilal bin Umayyah accused Sharik bin As-Sahma' (of committing adultery) with his wife. He came to the Prophet and told him about that. The Prophet said: '(Bring) four witnesses, otherwise (you will feel) the Hadd punishment on your back.' And he repeated that several times. Hilal said to him: 'By Allah, O Messenger of Allah! Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, knows that I am telling the truth, and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will certainly reveal to you that which will spare my back from the whip.' While they were like that, the Verse of Li'an was revealed to him: 'As to those who accuse their wives.' He called Hilal and he bore witness four times by Allah that he was telling the truth, and the fifth time he invoked the curse of Allah upon him if he were lying. Then he called the woman and she bore witness four times by Allah that he was lying. When it came to the fourth or fifth time, the Messenger of Allah said: 'Stop her, for it will inevitably bring the punishment of Allah upon the liar.' She hesitated until we thought that she was going to confess, then she said: 'I will not dishonor my people today.' Then she went ahead with the oath. The Messenger of Allah said: 'Wait and see. If she produces a child who is white, with straight hair and Qadiy'a eyes, then he belongs to Hilal bin Umayyah, but if she produces a child who is dark with curly hair, of average size and with narrow calves, then he belongs to Sharik bin As-Sahma'.' She produced a child who was dark with curly hair, of average size and with narrow calves. The Messenger of Allah said: 'Had not the matter been settled by the Book of Allah, I would have punished her severely.'" 
3470 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"Mention of Li'an was made in the presence of the Messenger of Allah and 'Asim bin 'Adiyy said something about that, then he went away. A man from among his people came to him, complaining that he had found a man with his wife. 'Asim said: 'I was only put to this test because of what I said.' He took him to the Messenger of Allah and told him of the situation in which he found his wife. That man was pale and slim with straight hair, and the one whom he claimed to have found with his wife was dark and well-built. The Messenger of Allah said: 'O Allah, make it clear to me.' Then she gave birth to a child who resembled the one whom her husband said he had found with her. So the Messenger of Allah conducted the procedure of Li'an between them." A man in the gathering said to Ibn 'Abbas: "Was she the one of whom the Messenger of Allah said: 'If I were to have stoned anyone without evidence I would have stoned this one?'" Ibn 'Abbas said: "No, that was a woman who used to do mischief even after becoming Muslim." 
3471 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas said:"Mention of Li'an was made in the presence of the Messenger of Allah and 'Asim bin 'Adiyy said something about that, then he went away. He was met by a man from among his people who told him that he had found a man with his wife. He took him to the Messenger of Allah and told him of the situation in which he found his wife. That man was pale and slim with straight hair, and the one whom he claimed to have found with his wife was dark and well built, with very curly hair. The Messenger of Allah said: 'O Allah, make it clear to me.' Then she gave birth to a child who resembled the one whom her husband said he had found with her. So the Messenger of Allah conducted the procedure of Li'an between them." A man in the gathering said to Ibn 'Abbas: "Was she the one of whom the Messenger of Allah said: 'If I were to have stoned anyone without evidence I would have stoned this one?'"

3473 | ,'Abdul-Malik bin Abi Sulaiman said:"I heard Sa'eed bin Jubair say: 'I was asked about the two who engage in Li'an during the governorship of Ibn Az-Zubair - should they be separated? I did not know what to say, so I got up and went to the house of Ibn 'Umar and said: "O Abu 'Abdur-Rahman, should the two who engage in Li'an be separated?" He said: "Yes, Subhan Allah! The first one who asked about that was so-and-so the son of so-and-so who said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what do you think if a man among us sees his wife committing immoral actions, and if he speaks of it, he will be speaking of a grave matter, but if he keeps quiet, he will be keeping quiet about a grave matter?' He did not answer him, then after that, he came to him and said: 'I was tried with the matter that I asked you about, so Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed these Verses in Surat An-Nur.: 'And for those who accuse their wives' until he reached: 'And the fifth (testimony) should be that the Wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth.' So he started with the man, exhorting him, reminding him, and telling him that the punishment in this world was less severe than the punishment in the Hereafter. He said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truth, I am not lying.' Then he turned to the woman and exhorted her and reminded her. She said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truth, he is lying.' So he started with the man, and he bore witness four times by Allah that he was telling the truth, and the fifth time (he invoked) the curse of Allah upon himself if he was lying. Then he turned to the woman and she bore witness four times by Allah that he was lying, and the fifth time (she invoked) the wrath of Allah upon herself if he was telling the truth. Then he separated them."'" 
3474 | ,It was narrated that Sa'eed bin Jubair said:"Al-Mus'ab did not separate the two who engaged in Li'an." Sa'eed said: "I mentioned that to Ibn 'Umar and he said: 'The Messenger of Allah separated the couple from Banu 'Ajlan.'" 
3475 | ,It was narrated from Ayyub, that Sa'eed bin Jubair said:"I said to Ibn 'Umar: 'A man accused his wife.' He said: 'The Messenger of Allah separated the couple from Banu 'Ajlan and said: Allah knows that one of you is lying, so will either of you repent? He said that to them three times and they did not respond, then he separated them.'" (One of the narrators) Ayyub said: "Amr bin Dinar said: 'In this Hadith there is something that I think you are not narrating.' He said: 'The man said: My wealth. He said: You are not entitled to any wealth. If you are telling the truth, you have consummated the marriage with her, and if you are lying then you are even less entitled to it.'"

3478 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that a man from Banu Fazarah came to the Messenger of Allah and said:"My wife has given birth to a black boy." The Messenger of Allah said: "Do you have camels?" He said: "Yes." He said: "What color are they?" He said: "Red." He said: "Are there any gray ones among them?" He said: "There are some gray ones among them." He said: "Where do you think they come from?" He said: "Perhaps it is hereditary." He said: "Likewise, perhaps this is hereditary."

This is the son of my brother 'Utbah bin Abi Waqqas, who made me promise to look after him because he is his son. Look at whom he resembles.' 'Abd bin Zam'ah said: 'He is my brother who was born on my father's bed to his slave woman.' The Messenger of Allah looked to determine at whom he resembled, and saw that he resembled 'Utbah. He said: 'He is for you, O 'Abd! The child is the bed's and for the fornicator is the stone. Veil yourself from him, O Sawdah bint Zam'ah.' And he never saw Sawdah again." 
3485 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair said:"Zam'ah had a slave woman with whom he used to have intercourse, but he suspected that someone else was also having intercourse with her. She gave birth to a child who resembled the one whom he suspected. Zam'ah died when she was pregnant, and Sawdah mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah said: 'The child is the bed's, but veil yourself from him, O Sawdah, for he is not a brother of yours.'" 
3486 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah said:"The child is the bed's, and for the fornicator is the stone." 
3487 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas and 'Abd bin Zam'ah disputed concerning a son of Zam'ah. Sa'd said: 'My brother 'Utbah urged me, if I came to Makkah: Look for the son of the slave woman of Zam'ah, for he is my son.' 'Abd bin Zam'ah said: 'He is the son of my father's slave woman who was born on my father's bed.' The Messenger of Allah saw that he resembled 'Utbah, but he said: 'The child is the bed's. Veil yourself from him, O Sawdah.'" 
3488 | ,It was narrated that Zaid bin Arqam said:"Three men were brought to 'Ali while he was in Yemen; they all had intercourse with a woman during a single menstrual cycle. He asked two of them: 'Do you affirm that this child belongs to (the third man)?' And they said: 'No.' He asked another two of them: 'Do you affirm that this child belongs to (the third man)?' And they said: 'No.' So he cast lots between them, and attributed the child to the one whom the lot fell, and obliged him to pay two-thirds of the Diyah. The Prophet was told of this, and he laughed so much that his back teeth became visible." 
3489 | ,It was narrated that Zaid bin Arqam said:"While we were with the Messenger of Allah, a man came to him from Yemen and started telling him (about an incident) while 'Ali was still in Yemen. He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, three men were brought to 'Ali who were disputing about a child, and they all had intercourse with a woman during a single menstrual cycle.'" And he quoted the same Hadith. 
3490 | ,It was narrated that Zaid bin Arqam said:"I was with the Messenger of Allah, and 'Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, was in Yemen at that time. A man came to him and said: 'I saw 'Ali when three men were brought to him who all claimed (to be the father) of a child. 'Ali said to one of them: Will you give the child up to him? And he refused. He said to (the next one): Will you give the child up to him? And he refused. He said to (the next one): Will you give the child up to him? And he refused. 'Ali said: You are disputing partners. I will cast lots among you, and whoever wins the draw, the child is for him, and he has to pay two-thirds of the Diyah.' The Messenger of Allah laughed so much that his back teeth became visible." 
3491 | ,It was narrated from a man from Hadramawt, that Zaid bin Arqam said:"The Messenger of Allah sent 'Ali to (be the governor of) Yemen, and a child was brought to him concerning whom three men were disputing." Then he quoted the same Hadith. Salamah bin Kuhail contradicted them. 
3492 | ,Salamah bin Kuhail said:"I heard Ash-Sha'bi narrating from Abu Al-Khalil or Ibn Abi Al-Khalil that three men had intercourse (with the same woman) during a single menstrual cycle;" and he mentioned something similar, but he did not mention Zaid bin Arqam or attribute anything to the Prophet. 
3493 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"The Messenger of Allah came to me looking happy and cheerful, and he said: 'Did you not see that Mujazziz looked at Zaid bin Harithah and Usamah and said: These feet belong to one another.'" 
3494 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said:"The Messenger of Allah came to me one day looking happy and said: 'O 'Aishah! Did you not see that Mujazziz Al-Mudliji came to me when Usamah bin Zaid was with me. He saw Usamah bin Zaid and Zaid with a blanket over them; their heads were covered but their feet were exposed, and he said: These feet belong to one another.'" 
3495 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdul-Hamid bin Salamah Al-Ansari, from his father, from his grandfather, that he became Muslim but his wife refused to become Muslim. A young son of theirs, who had not yet reached puberty, came, and the Prophet seated the father on one side and the mother on the other side, and he gave him the choice. He said:"O Allah, guide him," and (the child) went to his father. 
3496 | ,It was narrated that Abu Maimunah said:"While I was with Abu Hurairah he said: 'A woman came to the Messenger of Allah and said: May my father and mother be ransomed for you! My husband wants to take my son away, but he helps me, and brings me water from the well of Abu 'Inabah. Her husband came and said: Who is going to take my son from me? The Messenger of Allah said: "O boy, this is your father and this is your mother; take the hand of whichever of them you want." He took his mother's hand and she left with him.'" 
3497 | ,Ar-Rubayy' bint Mu'awwidh bin 'Afra' narrated that Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas hit his wife and broke her arm --her name was Jamilah bint 'Abdullah bin Ubayy. Her brother came to the Messenger of Allah to complain about him, and the Messenger of Allah sent for Thabit and said:"Take what she owes you and let her go." He said: "Yes." And the Messenger of Allah ordered her to wait for one menstrual cycle and then go to her family. 
3498 | ,'Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin 'Ubadah bin As-Samit narrated from Rubayy' bint Mu'awwidh. He said:"I said to her: 'Tell me your Hadith.' She said: 'I was separated from husband by Khul', then I came to 'Uthman and asked him: What 'Iddah do I have to observe? He said: You do not have to observe any 'Iddah, unless you had intercourse with him recently, in which case you should stay with him until you have menstruated. He said: In that I am following the ruling of the Messenger of Allah concerning Mariam Al-Maghaliyyah, who was married to Thabit bin Qais and was separated by Khul' from him.'" 
3499 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas with regard to Allah's saying:"Whatever a Verse (revelation) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it." and He said: "And when We change a Verse in place of another --and Allah knows best what He sends down." and He said: "Allah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book."   "The first thing that was abrogated in the Qur'an was the Qiblah."  And He said: "And divorced women shall wait (as regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods." and He said: "And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the 'Iddah, if you have doubt (about their periods), is three months." So (some) of that was abrogated, (according to) His, Most High, saying: "And then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no 'Iddah have you to count in respect of them." 
3500 | ,It was narrated that Zainab bint Umm Salamah said:"Umm Habibah said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah say: It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for anyone who dies for more than three days, except for a husband; (she mourns for him for) four months and ten (days)." 
3501 | ,It was narrated from Zainab bint Umm Salamah -I (the narrator) said:"From her mother?" He said: "Yes" - "that the Prophet was asked about a woman whose husband had died but they were worried about her eyes - could she use kohl?" He said: "One of you used to stay in her house wearing her shabbiest clothes for a year, then she would come out. No, (the mourning period is) four months and ten (days)." 
3502 | ,It was narrated from Zainab bint Umm Salamah, that Umm Salamah and Umm Habibah said:"A woman came to the Prophet and said: 'My daughter's husband has died, and I am worried about her eyes. Can I apply kohl to her?' The Messenger of Allah said: 'One of you used to stay (in mourning) for a year. Rather (the mourning period is) four months and ten (days). And when that year had passed she would go out and fling a piece of dung behind her.'" 
3503 | ,It was narrated from Safiyyah bint Abi 'Ubaid that she heard Hafsah bint 'Umar, the wife of the Prophet, (narrate) that the Prophet said:"It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for anyone who dies for more than three days except for a husband; she should mourn for him for four months and ten (days)." 
3504 | ,It was narrated from Safiyyah bint Abi 'Ubaid from one of the wives of the Prophet, and from Umm Salamah, that the Prophet said:"It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for anyone who dies for more than three days except for a husband; she should mourn for him for four months and ten (days)." 
3505 | ,A similar report was narrated from Safiyyah bint Abi 'Ubaid from one of the wives of the Prophet -and she is Umm Salamah- from the Prophet. 
3506 | ,It was narrated from Al-Miswar bin Makhramah that Subai'ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth one day after her husband died. She came to the Messenger of Allah and asked his permission to marry, and he gave her permission to marry and she married. 
3507 | ,It was narrated from Al-Miswar bin Makhramah that the Prophet commanded Sabai'ah to get married when her Nifas ended. 
3508 | ,It was narrated that Abu As-Sanabil said:"Subai'ah gave birth twenty-three or twenty-five days after her husband died, and when her Nifas ended she expressed her wish to remarry and was criticized for that. Mention of that was made to the Messenger of Allah and he said: 'There is nothing to stop her; her term has ended.'" 
3509 | ,Abu Salamah said:"Abu Hurairah and Ibn 'Abbas differed concerning the widow who gives birth after her husband's death. Abu Hurairah said: 'She may be married.' Ibn 'Abbas said: '(She has to wait) for the longer of the two periods.' They sent word to Umm Salamah and she said: 'The husband of Subai'ah died and she gave birth fifteen days -half a month- after her husband died.' She said: 'Two men proposed marriage to her, and she was inclined toward one of them. When they feared that she was becoming single-minded (on this issue, and not consulting her family), they said: It is not permissible for you to marry. She went to the Messenger of Allah and he said: 'It is permissible for you to marry, so marry whomever you want.''" 
3510 | ,It was narrated that Abu Salamah said:"Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Hurairah were asked about the woman whose husband dies when she is pregnant. Ibn 'Abbas said: '(She should wait) for the longer of the two periods.' Abu Hurairah said: 'When she gives birth it becomes permissible for her to marry.' Abu Salamah went to Umm Salamah and asked her about that, and she said: 'Subai'ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth half a month after her husband died, and two men proposed to her. One was young and one was old, and she was inclined toward the young one. So the old one said: It is not permissible for you to marry. Her family was not there, and he hoped that if he went to her family they would marry her to him. She went to the Messenger of Allah and he said: It is permissible for you to marry, so marry whomever you want.'" 
3511 | ,Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman said:"It was said to Ibn 'Abbas concerning a woman who gives birth one day after her husband died: 'Can she get married?' He said: 'No, not until the longer of the two periods has ended.' He said: 'Allah says: And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden.' He said: 'That only applies in the case of divorce.' Abu Hurairah said: 'I agree with my brother's son' --meaning, Abu Salamah. He sent his slave Kuraib and told him: 'Go to Umm Salamah and ask her: Was this the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah?' He came back and said: 'Yes, Subai'ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth twenty days after her husband died, and the Messenger of Allah told her to get married, and Abu As-Sanabil was one of those who proposed marriage to her.'" 
3512 | ,It was narrated from Sulaiman bin Yasir that Abu Hurairah, Ibn 'Abbas, and Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman were talking about the 'Iddah of a woman whose husband dies, and she gives birth after her husband dies. Ibn 'Abbas said:"She should observe 'Iddah for the longer of the two periods." Abu Salamah said: "No, it becomes permissible for her to marry when she has given birth." Abu Hurairah said: "I agree with my brother's son." So they sent word to Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet, and she said: "Subai'ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth shortly after her husband died; she consulted the Messenger of Allah and he told her to get married." 
3513 | ,It was narrated that Umm Salamah said:"Subai'ah gave birth a few days after her husband died, and the Messenger of Allah told her to get married." 
3514 | ,It was narrated from Sulaiman bin Yasar that 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas and Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman disagreed concerning a woman who gave birth one day after her husband died. 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas said:"(She should wait) for the longer of the two periods." Abu Salamah said: "When she has given birth, it becomes permissible for her to remarry." Abu Hurairah came and said: "I agree with my brother's son" -meaning Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman. They sent Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas, to Umm Salamah to ask her about that. He came back to them and told them that she said: "Subai'ah gave birth one day after her husband died;" she mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah and he said: "It has become permissible for you to marry." 
3515 | ,Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman said:"Ibn 'Abbas, Abu Hurairah and I were together, and Ibn 'Abbas said: 'If a woman gives birth after her husband dies, her 'Iddah is the longer of the two periods.'" Abu Salamah said: "We sent Kuraib to Umm Salamah to ask her about that. He came to us and told us from her that the husband of Subai'ah died and she gave birth a few days after her husband died, and the Messenger of Allah told her to get married." 
3516 | ,It was narrated from Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman that Zainab bint Abi Salamah told him, from her mother, Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet:"That a woman from Aslam who was called Subai'ah was married to her husband, and he died while she was pregnant. Abu As-Sanabil bin Ba'kak proposed to her but she refused to marry him. He said: 'You cannot get married until you have observed 'Iddah for the longer of the two periods.' Approximately twenty days later she gave birth. She went to the Messenger of Allah and he said: 'Get married.'" 
3517 | ,Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman said:"While Abu Hurairah and I were with Ibn 'Abbas, a woman came and said that her husband had died while she was pregnant, then she had given birth less than four months after the day he died. Ibn 'Abbas said: '(You have to wait) for the longer of the two periods.'" Abu Salamah said: "A man from among the Companions of the Prophet told me that Subai'ah Al-Aslamiyyah came to the Messenger of Allah and said that her husband died while she was pregnant, and she gave birth less than four months after he died. The Messenger of Allah told her to get married. Abu Hurairah said: 'And I bear witness to that.'" 
3518 | ,'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah narrated that his father wrote to 'Umar bin 'Abdullah bin Arqam Az-Zuhri, telling him to go to Subai'ah bint Al-Harith Al-Aslamiyyah and ask her about her Hadith and what the Messenger of Allah had said to her when she consulted him. 'Umar bin 'Abdullah wrote back to 'Abdullah bin 'Utbah telling him that Subai'ah told him, that she was married to Sahl bin Khawlah -who was from Banu 'Amir bin Lu-ayy and was one of those who had been present at Badr- and her husband died during the Farewell Pilgrimage while she was pregnant. She gave birth soon after he died, and when her Nifas ended she adorned herself to receive proposals of marriage. Abu As-Sanabil bin Ba'kak -a man from Banu 'Abd Ad-Dar- went to her and said to her:'Why do I see you adorned? Perhaps you want to get married, but by Allah you will not get married until four months and ten days have passed.' Subai'ah said: 'When he said that to me, I put on my clothes in the evening and went to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about that. He ruled that it had become permissible for me to marry when I gave birth, and he told me to get married if I wanted to.'" 
3519 | ,It was narrated from Yazid bin Abi Habib that Muhammad bin Muslim Az-Zuhri wrote to him mentioning that 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah told him, that Zufar bin Aws bin Al-Hadathan An-Nasri told him that Abu As-Sanabil bin Ba'kak bin As-Sabbaq said to Subai'ah Al-Aslamiyyah:"It is not permissible for you to get married until four months and ten days, the longer of the two periods, have passed." She went to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about that. She said that the Messenger of Allah ruled that she could get married when she had given birth. She was nine months pregnant when her husband died, and she was married to Sa'd bin Khawlah, who died during the Farewell Pilgrimage with the Messenger of Allah. She married a young man from her people when she had given birth to (the child). 
3520 | ,It was narrated from 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah that 'Abdullah bin 'Utbah wrote to 'Umar bin 'Abdullah bin Al-Arqam Az-Zuhri, telling him:"Go to Subai'ah bint Al-Harith Al-Aslamiyyah, and ask her about the ruling of the Messenger of Allah concerning her pregnancy." He said: "So 'Umar bin 'Abdullah went to her and asked her. She told him that she was married to Sa'd bin Khawlah, who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah who had been present at Badr. He died during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and she gave birth before four months and ten days had passed since her husband's death. When her Nifas ended, Abu As-Sanabil -a man from Banu 'Abd Ad-Dar- went to her and saw that she had adorned herself. He said: 'Perhaps you want to get married before four months and ten days has passed?' She said: 'When I heard that from Abu As-Sanabil, I went to the Messenger of Allah and told him my story. The Messenger of Allah said: 'It is permissible for you to marry when you gave birth.''" 
3521 | ,It was narrated that Muhammad said:"I was sitting with some people in Al-Kufah in a large gathering of the Ansar, among whom was 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila. They spoke about the story of Subai'ah and I mentioned what 'Abdullah bin 'Utbah bin Mas'ud had said in meaning." (One of the narrators) Ibn 'Awn's saying was: "when she gives birth." Ibn Abi Layla said: 'But his (paternal) uncle did not say that.' I raised my voice and said: 'Would I dare to tell lies about 'Abdullah bin 'Utbah when he is in the vicinity of Al-Kufah?'" He said: "Then I met Malik and said: 'What did Ibn Mas'ud say about the story of Subai'ah?' He said: 'He said: "Are you going to be too strict with her and not allow her the concession (with regard to the 'Iddah)? The shorter Surah about women (At-Talaq) was revealed after the longer one (Al-Baqarah)."'" 
3522 | ,It was narrated from 'Alqamah bin Qais that Ibn Mas'ud said:"Whoever wants, I will meet and debate with him and invoke the curse of Allah upon those who lie. The Verse: 'And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden.' was only revealed after the Verse about women whose husbands die. 'When a woman whose husband has died gives birth, it becomes permissible for her to marry.'" This is the wording of Maimun (one of the narrators). 
3523 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah that the shorter Surah, that speaks of women (At-Talaq), was revealed after Al-Baqarah. 
3524 | ,It was narrated from Ibn Mas'ud, that he was asked about a man who married a woman, but did not name a Mahr or consummate the marriage before he died. Ibn Mas'ud said:"She should have a Mahr like that of women like her, no less and no more; she has to observe the 'Iddah, and she is entitled to inherit." Ma'qil bin Sinan Al-Ashja'i stood up and said: "The Messenger of Allah passed a similar judgment among us concerning Birwa' bint Washiq." And Ibn Masud rejoiced at that. 
3525 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that the Messenger of Allah said:"It is not permissible for a woman to mourn for anyone who dies for more than three days, except for her husband." 
3526 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that the Prophet said:"It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days, except for her husband." 
3527 | ,It was narrated from Zainab bint Abi Salamah that Umm Habibah said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah say this on this Minbar: 'It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and His Messenger to mourn for anyone who dies for more than three days, except for a husband, (for whom the mourning period is) four months and ten days.'" 
3528 | ,It was narrated from Al-Fari'ah bint Malik that her husband went out to pursue some slaves and they killed him. Shu'bah and Ibn Juraij said:"She was in a remote house. She came with her brothers to the Messenger of Allah and told him (about the situation) and he granted her a concession. When she was leaving he called her back and said: 'Stay in your house until the term prescribed is fulfilled.'" 
3529 | ,It was narrated from Al-Furai'ah bint Malik that her husband hired some slaves to work for him and they killed him. She mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah and said:"I am not living in a house that belongs to him, and I do not receive maintenance from him; should I move to my family with my two orphans and stay with them?" He said: "Do that." Then he said: "What did you say?" So she told him again and he said: "Observe your 'Iddah where the news came to you." 
3530 | ,It was narrated from Furai'ah that her husband went out to pursue some slaves of his and he was killed on the edge of Al-Qadum. She said:"I came to the Prophet and mentioned moving to (join) my family." She told him about her situation. She said: "He allowed me, then, when I turned to leave, he called me back and said: 'Stay with your family until the term prescribed is fulfilled.'" 
3531 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that this Verse abrogated the woman's 'Iddah among her family, and she may observe her 'Iddah wherever she wants. That is the saying of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime:without turning them out. 
3532 | ,Furai'ah bint Malik, the sister of Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri, said:"My husband died in Al-Qadum, so I went to the Prophet and told him that our house was remote." He gave her permission then he called her back and said: "Stay in your house for four months and ten days, until the term prescribed is fulfilled." 
3533 | ,It was narrated from Humaid bin Nafi' that Zainab bint Abi Salamah told him these three Hadiths. Zainab said:"I entered upon Umm Habibah, the wife of the Prophet, when her father Abu Sufyan bin Harb died. Umm Habibah called for some perfume and put some on a young girl, then she put some on her cheeks. Then she said: 'By Allah, I do not have any need for perfume but I heard the Messenger of Allah say: It is not permissible for any woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for anyone who dies for more than three days, except for a husband, (for whom the mourning period is) four months and ten days.'" 
3533b | ,Zainab said:"Then I went into Zainab bint Jahsh when her brother died, and she called for some perfume and put some on. Then she said: 'By Allah, I do not have any need for perfume but I heard the Messenger of Allah say on the Minbar: It is not permissible for any woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for anyone who dies for more than three days, except for a husband, (for whom the mourning period is) four months and ten days.'" 
3533c | ,Zainab said:"I heard Umm Salamah say: 'A woman came to the Messenger of Allah and said: O Messenger of Allah, my daughter's husband has died and she has a problem in her eye; can I put kohl on her? The Messenger of Allah said: No. Then he said: It is four months and ten days. During the Jahiliyyah one of you would throw a piece of dung at the end of the year.'" Humaid said: "I said to Zainab: 'What is this throwing a piece of dung at the end of the year?' She said: 'If a woman's husband died, she would enter a small room (Hifsh) and wear her worst clothes, and she would not put on perfume or anything until a year. Then an animal would be brought, a donkey or sheep or bird, and she would end her 'Iddah with it (clean herself with it), and usually any animal used for that purpose would die. Then she would come out and would be given a piece of dung which she would throw, then she would go back to whatever she wanted of perfume, etc.'"   In the narration of Muhammad (bin Salamah) Malik said: Hifsh means hut. 
3534 | ,It was narrated that Umm 'Atiyyah said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'No woman should mourn for anyone who dies for more than three days, except for a husband, for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days. She should not wear garments that are dyed or patterned, or put on kohl or comb her hair, and she should not put on any perfume except when purifying herself after her period, when she may use a little of Qust or Azfar.'" 
3535 | ,It was narrated from Safiyyah bint Shaibah, from Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet, that the Prophet said:"The woman whose husband has died should not wear clothes that are dyed with safflower or red clay, and she should not use dye nor kohl." 
3536 | ,It was narrated from Umm 'Atiyyah that the Prophet said:"It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day, to mourn for anyone who dies for more than three days, except for a husband; she should not use kohl, dye nor wear dyed clothes." 
3537 | ,Umm Hakim bint Asid narrated from her mother that her husband died and she had a problem in her eye, so she applied kohl to clear her eyes. She sent a freed slave woman of hers to Umm Salamah to ask her about using kohl to clear her eyes. She said:"Do not use kohl unless it cannot be avoided. The Messenger of Allah entered upon me when Abu Salamah died and I had put some aloe juice on my eyes. He said: 'What is this, O Umm Salamah?' I said: 'It is aloe juice, O Messenger of Allah, there is no perfume in it.' He said: 'It makes the face look bright, so only use it at night, and do not comb your hair with perfume or henna, for it is a dye.' I said: 'With what can I comb it, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'With lote leaves -cover your head with them.'" 
3538 | ,Zainab bint Abi Salamah narrated that her mother Umm Salamah said:"A woman from the Quraish came and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, my daughter's eyes are inflamed; shall I apply kohl to her?' (The daughter's) husband had died so (the Prophet) said: 'Not until four months and ten days (have passed).' Then she said: 'I fear for her sight.' He said: 'No, not until four months and ten days (have passed). During the Jahiliyyah one of you would mourn for her husband for a year, then when one year had passed she would throw a piece of dung.'" 
3539 | ,It was narrated from Zainab bint Abi Salamah, from her mother, that a woman came to the Prophet and asked him about her daughter whose husband had died and she was ill. He said:"One of you used to mourn for a year, then throw a piece of dung when a year had passed. Rather it (the mourning period) is four months and ten days." 
3540 | ,It was narrated from Zainab bint Abi Salamah, from Umm Salamah that a woman from the Quraish came to the Messenger of Allah and said:"My daughter's husband has died, and I am worried about her eyes; she needs kohl." He said: "One of you used to throw a piece of dung after a year had passed. Rather it (the mourning period) is four months and ten days." I (the narrator) said to Zainab: "What does 'after a year had passed' mean?" She said: "During the Jahiliyyah, if a woman's husband died she would go to the worst room she had and stay there, then, when a year had passed, she would come out and throw a piece of dung behind her." 
3541 | ,It was narrated from Zainab that a woman asked Umm Salamah and Umm Habibah whether she could put on kohl during her 'Iddah following her husband's death. She said:"A woman came to the Prophet and asked him about that, and he said: 'During the Jahiliyyah, if her husband died, one of you would stay (in mourning) for a year, then she would throw a piece of dung then come out. Rather it (the mourning period) is four months and ten days, until the term prescribed is fulfilled.'" 
3542 | ,It was narrated from Hafsah, from Umm 'Atiyyah, from the Prophet, that he granted a concession to the woman whose husband has died, allowing her to use Qust and Azfar when purifying herself following her menses. 
3543 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, with regard to Allah's saying:"And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance and residence without turning them out." This was abrogated by the Verse on inheritance, which allocated to her one-quarter or one-eighth. And the appointed time ('Iddah) of one year was abrogated and replaced with the ('Iddah) term of four months and ten days. 
3544 | ,It was narrated from 'Ikrimah with regard to the saying of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime:"And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance and residence without turning them out," that he said: "This was abrogated by: 'And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days.'" 
3545 | ,'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Asim narrated that Fatimah bint Qais -who was married to a man of Banu Makhzum- told him that he divorced her three times. He went out on a military campaign and told his representative to give her some provision. She thought it was too little, so she went to one of the wives of the Prophet, and the Messenger of Allah came in while she was with her. She said:"O Messenger of Allah, this is Fatimah bint Qais who has been divorced by so-and-so. He sent her some provision but she rejected it. He said that it was something he did not have to do (a favor)." He said: "He is telling the truth." The Prophet said: "Go to Umm Kulthum and observe your 'Iddah in her house." Then he said: "Umm Kulthum is a woman who has a lot of visitors. Go to 'Abdullah bin Umm Maktum for he is blind." So she went to 'Abdullah and observed her 'Iddah in his house, until her 'Iddah was over. Then Abu Al-Jahm and Mu'awiyah bin Abi Sufyan proposed to her. So she came to the Messenger of Allah to consult him about them. He said: "As for Abu Al-Jahm, he is a man the waving of whose stick I fear for you. And as for Mu'awiyah he is a man who does not have any money." So she married Usamah bin Zaid after that. 
3546 | ,It was narrated from Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman that Fatimah bint Qais told him that she was married to Abu 'Amr bin Hafs bin Al-Mughirah, who divorced her by giving her the last of three divorces. Fatimah said that she came to the Messenger of Allah and consulted him about leaving her house. He told her to move to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, the blind man. Marwan refused to believe Fatimah about the divorced woman leaving her house. 'Urwah said:"Aishah denounced Fatimah for that." 
3547 | ,Hisham narrated from his father that Fatimah said:"I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! My husband has divorced me three times and I am afraid that my house be broken into.' So he told her to move." 
3548 | ,It was narrated that Ash-Sha'bi said:"I came to Fatimah bint Qais and asked her about the ruling of the Messenger of Allah concerning her. She said that her husband divorced her irrevocably, and she referred her dispute with him, concerning accommodation and maintenance, to the Messenger of Allah. She said: 'He did not give me (the right to) accommodation and maintenance, and he told me to observe my 'Iddah in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum,'" 
3549 | ,It was narrated that Fatimah bint Qais said:"My husband divorced me and I wanted to move, so I went to the Messenger of Allah and he said: 'Move to the house of your paternal cousin 'Amr bin Umm Maktum, and observe your 'Iddah there.'" Al-Aswad hit him (Ash-Sha'bi) with a pebble and said: "Woe be to you! Why do you issue such a Fatwa? 'Umar said: 'If you bring two witnesses who will testify that they heard that from the Messenger of Allah (we will believe you), otherwise, we will not leave the Book of Allah for the word of a woman.' 'And turn them not out of their (husband's) homes nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open Fahishah.'" 
3550 | ,It was narrated from Jabir that his maternal aunt was divorced, and she wanted to go out to some date palms of hers, but she met a man who told her not to do that. She went to the Messenger of Allah and he said:"Go out and take the harvest of your date palms, for perhaps you will give Zakah or do some good (give voluntary charity)." 
3551 | ,It was narrated that Abu Bakr bin Hafs said:Abu Salamah and I entered upon Fatimah bint Qais, who said: "My husband divorced me and he did not give me any accommodation or maintenance." She said: "He left with me ten measures (Aqfizah) (of food) with a cousin of his: Five of barley and five of dates. I went to the Messenger of Allah and told him about that. He said: 'He has spoken the truth.' And he told me to observe my 'Iddah in the house of so-and-so." And her husband had divorced her irrevocably. 
3552 | ,'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Utbah narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin 'Uthman divorced the daughter of Sa'eed bin Zaid -whose mother was Hamnah bint Qais- irrevocably. Her maternal aunt Fatimah bint Qais told her to move from the house of 'Abdullah bin 'Amr. Marwan heard of that, so he sent word to her, telling her to go back to her home until her 'Iddah was over. She sent a word to him telling him that her maternal aunt Fatimah had issued a Fatwa to that effect, and she told her that the Messenger of Allah had issued a Fatwa to her, telling her to move when Abu 'Amr bin Hafs Al-Makhzumi divorced her. Marwan sent Qabisah bin Dhu'aib to Fatimah to ask her about that. She said that she had been married to Abu 'Amr when the Messenger of Allah appointed 'Ali bin Abi Talib as governor of Yemen, and he went out with him, then he sent word to her divorcing her, and that was the final divorce for her. He told her to ask Al-Harith bin Hisham and 'Ayyash for her provisions that her husband had allocated for her. They said:"By Allah, she is not entitled to any provision. So, she sent to Al-Harith bin Hisham and 'Ayyash asking them for the provisions from us unless she is pregnant, and she has no right to live in our house unless we permit her." Fatimah said that she went to the Messenger of Allah and told him about that and he said that they had told the truth. She said: "I said: 'Where shall I move to, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Move to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum' -who was the blind man, concerning whom Allah rebuked him in His Book. I moved to his house, and I used to take off my outer garments." Then the Messenger of Allah married her to Usamah bin Zaid. 
3553 | ,It was narrated from 'Amr bin Az-Zubair that Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish told him that she came to the Messenger of Allah and complained to him about (continual) bleeding. The Messenger of Allah said to her:"That is a vein. Look and when your period comes, do not pray, and when your period ends, then purify yourself and pray during the time between one period and the next." 
3554 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, regarding Allah's saying:"Whatever a Verse do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it." and "And when We change a Verse in place of another -and Allah knows best what He sends down" (Al-Nahl 16:101) and "Allah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book." The first thing that was abrogated in the Qur'an was the Qiblah. And He said: "And divorced women shall wait (as regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day." "And their husbands have better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation." -that is because when a man divorced his wife, he had more right to take her back, even if he had divorced her three times. Then (Allah) abrogated that and said: "The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness." 
3555 | ,Ibn 'Umar said:"I divorced my wife when she was menstruating. 'Umar went to the Prophet and told him about that. The Prophet said: 'Tell him to take her back, then when she becomes pure, if he wants to, let him divorce her.'" I said to Ibn 'Umar: "Did that count as one divorce?" He said: "Why not? What do you think if some becomes helpless and behaves foolishly." 
3556 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that he divorced his wife when she was menstruating. 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, mentioned that to the Prophet and he said:"Tell him to take her back until she menstruates again, then when she becomes pure, if he wants he may divorce her and if he wants he may keep her. This is the divorce that Allah has enjoined. Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, says: 'The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness.'" 
3557 | ,When Ibn 'Umar was asked about a man who divorced his wife when she was menstruating, he would say:"If it is the first or second divorce, the Messenger of Allah would tell him to take her back and keep her until she has menstruated again and purified herself, then divorce her before having intercourse with her. But if it was three simultaneous divorces, then you have disobeyed Allah with regard to the way in which divorce should be conducted and your wife has become irrevocably divorced." 
3558 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that he divorced his wife when she was menstruating, and the Messenger of Allah told him to take her back. 
3559 | ,Ibn Tawus narrated from his father that he heard 'Abdullah bin 'Umar being asked about a man who divorced his wife when she was menstruating. He said:"Do you know 'Abdullah bin 'Umar?" He said: "Yes." He said: "He divorced his wife when she was menstruating, and 'Umar went to the Prophet and told him about that. He ordered him to take her back until she became pure," and I did not hear him adding anything to that. 
3560 | ,It was narrated from 'Umar that the Prophet -'Amr (one of the narrators) said:"The Messenger of Allah- had divorced Hafsah, then he took her back." And Allah knows best. 

3561 | It was narrated that Salamah bin Nufail Al-Kindi said:"I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah when a man said: 'O Messenger of Allah! The people have lost interest in horses and put down their weapons, and they say there is no Jihad, and that war has ended.' The Messenger of Allah turned to face him and said: 'They are lying, now the fighting is to come. There will always be a group among my Ummah who will fight for the truth, for whom Allah will cause some people to deviate, and grant them provision from them, until the Hour begins and until the promise of Allah comes. Goodness is tied to the forelocks of horses until the Day of Resurrection. It has been revealed to me that I am going to die and will not stay long, and you will follow me group after group, striking one another's necks. And the place of safety for the believers is Ash-Sham.'" 
3562 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'There is goodness tied to the forelocks of horses until the Day of Resurrection. And horses are of three types: Those that bring reward to man, those that are a means of protection for a man, and those that are a burden (of sin) for a man. As for those that bring reward, they are kept for the cause of Allah and for Jihad. No fodder enters their stomach but for everything that enters their stomachs, reward is written for him, even if he puts them out to pasture.'" And he quoted the Hadith. 
3563 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah said:"Horses may bring reward to a man, or they may be a means of protection, or they may be a burden (of sin). As for that which brings reward, it is a man who keeps it for the cause of Allah and ties it with a long rope in a pasture or a garden; whatever it eats or drinks in that pasture or garden will count as good deeds for him. If it breaks its rope and jumps over one or two hills, its footsteps" -and according to the Hadith of Al-Harith, "its dung will count as good deeds for him. If it passes by a river and drinks from it, even though (its owner) did not intend to give it water from that river, that will also bring him reward. If a man keeps a horse in order to earn an independent living and avoid asking others for help, and he does not forget his duty toward Allah with regard to their (the horses') necks and backs, then they will be a means of protection for him. If a man keeps horses out of pride, to show off before others and to fight the Muslims, then that will be a burden (of sin) for him." The Prophet was asked about donkeys and he said: "Nothing has been revealed to me concerning them except this Verse which is comprehensive in meaning: 'So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.'" 
3564 | ,It was narrated that Anas said:"There was nothing dearer to the Messenger of Allah after women than horses." 
3565 | ,It was narrated that Abu Wahb, who was a Companion of the Prophet, said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'Call (your children) by the names of the prophets. And the most beloved names to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, are 'Abdullah and 'Abdur-Rahman. Keep horses; wipe their forelocks and posteriors, and prepare them for Jihad, but do not prepare them to seek vengeance for people killed during the Jahiliyyah. You should seek out Kumait, horses with a white mark on the face and white feet, or red with a white mark on the face and white feet, or black with a white mark on the face and white feet.'" 
3566 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:The Prophet used to dislike the Shikal among horses. And the wording is that of Isma'il. 
3567 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet used to dislike the Shikal among horses. 
3568 | ,It was narrated from Salim, from his father, that the Prophet said:"Omens are only in three things: a woman, a horse or a house."

3578 | ,It was narrated that Khalid bin Yazid Al-Juhani said:"Uqbah bin 'Amir used to pass by me and say: 'O Khalid, let us go out and shoot arrows.' One day I came late and he said: 'O Khalid, come and I will tell you what the Messenger of Allah said.' So I went to him and he said: 'The Messenger of Allah said: Allah will admit three people to Paradise because of one arrow: The one who makes it seeking good thereby, the one who shoots it and the one who hands it to him. So shoot and ride, and if you shoot that is dearer to me than if you ride. And play is only in three things: A man training his horse, and playing with his wife, and shooting with his bow and arrow. Whoever gives up shooting after learning it because he is no longer interested in it, that is a blessing for which he is ungrateful -or that he has rejected.'" 
3579 | ,It was narrated that Abu Dharr said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'There is no Arabian horse but it is allowed to offer two supplications every Sahar (end of the night): O Allah, You have caused me to be owned by whoever You wanted among the sons of Adam, and you have made me belong to him. Make me the dearest of his family and wealth to him, or among the dearest of his family and wealth to him.'" 
3580 | ,It was narrated that Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, said:"A mule was given as a gift to the Messenger of Allah and he rode it."

3581 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abbas said:I was with Ibn 'Abbas and a man asked him: "Did the Messenger of Allah recite during Zuhr and 'Asr?" He said: "No." He said: "Perhaps he used to recite to himself?" He said: "May your face be scratched! This question is worse than the first one. The Messenger of Allah was a slave whose Lord commanded him and he conveyed (the message). By Allah, the Messenger of Allah did not specify anything for us above the people, except for three things: He commanded us to perform Wudu' properly, not to consume charity, and not to mate donkeys with horses." 
3582 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah said:"Whoever keeps a horse for the cause of Allah out of faith in Allah and believing the promise of Allah, its feed, water, urine and dung will all count as Hasanat in the balance of his deeds." 
3583 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah organized a horse race and sent them from Al-Hafya' and its finish line was Thaniyyat Al-Wada'; and he organized a race for horses that had not been made lean, and the course stretched from Ath-Thaniyyah to the Masjid of Banu Zuraiq.

3588 | ,It was narrated that Anas said:"The Messenger of Allah had a she-camel called Al-'Adba' which could not be beaten. One day a Bedouin came on a riding-camel and beat her (in a race). The Muslims were upset by that, and when he saw the expressions on their faces they said: 'O Messenger of Allah, Al-'Adba' has been beaten.' He said: 'It is a right upon Allah that nothing is raised in this world except He lowers it.'" 
3589 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah said:"There should be no awards (for victory in a competition) except over camels or horses." 
3590 | ,It was narrated from 'Imran bin Husain that the Messenger of Allah said:"There is no 'bringing', no 'avoidance' and no Shighar in Islam, and whoever robs is not one of us." 
3591 | ,It was narrated from 'Imran bin Husain that the Messenger of Allah said:"There is no 'bringing', no 'avoidance' and no Shighar in Islam." 
3592 | ,It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:"The Messenger of Allah raced with a Bedouin and (the latter) won. It was as if the Companions of the Messenger of Allah were upset by this, so he said: 'It is a right upon Allah that there is nothing that raises itself in this world except that He lowers it.'"

I came to the Messenger of Allah and said: 'I have acquired some land and I have never acquired any wealth that is dearer to me or more precious than it.' He said: 'If you wish, you can give it in charity.'" So he gave it in charity on condition that it would not be bought or given away, for the poor, relatives, slaves, guests and wayfarers. And there is no sin on the administrator if he eats from it or feeds others on a reasonable basis, with no intention of becoming wealthy from it.

He came to the Prophet and said: I have acquired some land at Khaibar, and I have never been given any wealth that is more precious to me than it. What do you command me to do with it? He said: If you wish, you can 'freeze' it and give it in charity. So he gave it in charity on condition that it would not be sold, given away or inherited, to the poor, relatives, slaves, for the cause of Allah, guests and wayfarers. There is no sin on the one who administers it if he eats from it on a reasonable basis and feeds his friend, with no intention of becoming wealthy from it.'"

He said: 'I have acquired a great deal of land, and I have never acquired any wealth that is more precious to me than it. What do you command me to do with it?' He said: 'If you wish, you may freeze it and give it in charity.' So he gave it in charity on condition that it would not be sold or given away, and he gave it in charity to the poor, relatives, to emancipate slaves, for the cause of Allah, for wayfarers and guests. There is no sin -on the administrator- if he eats (from it) or feeds a friend, with no intention of becoming wealthy from it.'" These are the wordings of Isma'il.

So he 'froze' it, stipulating that it should not be sold, given as a gift or inherited, and he gave it in charity to the poor, relatives, slaves, the needy, wayfarers and guests. There is no sin on the administrator if he eats from it on a reasonable basis or feeds a friend with no intention of becoming wealthy from it.

When I got there, it was said that 'Uthman bin 'Affan had come. He came, wearing a yellowish cloak. I said to my companion: Stay where you are until I find out what is happening. 'Uthman said: Is 'Ali here? Is Az-Zubair here? Is Talhah here? Is Sa'd here? They said: Yes.

Yet today you are preventing me from drinking from it, so that I have to drink salty water.' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'I adjure you by Allah and by Islam, are you aware that I equipped the army of Al-'Usrah (Tabuk) from my own wealth?' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'I adjure you by Allah and by Islam, are you aware that when the Masjid became too small for the people and the Messenger of Allah said: Who will buy the plot of the family of so and so and add it to the Masjid, in return for a better plot in Paradise? I bought it with my capital and added it to the Masjid? Yet now you are preventing me from praying two Rak'ahs therein.' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'I adjure you by Allah and by Islam, are you aware that when the Messenger of Allah was atop Thabir -the Thabir in Makkah- and with him were Abu Bakr, 'Umar and myself, the mountain shook, and the Messenger of Allah kicked it with his foot and said: Be still, Thabir, for upon you are a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs?' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'Allahu Akbar! They have testified for me, by the Lord of the Ka'bah' -i.e., that I am a martyr." 
3609 | ,It was narrated from Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman that 'Uthman looked out over them when they besieged him and said:"By Allah, I adjure a man who heard the Messenger of Allah, on the day when the mountain shook with him, and he kicked it with his foot and said: 'Be still, for there is no one upon you but a Prophet or a Siddiq or two martyrs,' and I was with him." Some men responded and affirmed that. Then he said: "By Allah, I adjure a man who witnessed the Messenger of Allah, on the day of Bai'at Al-Ridwan, say: 'This is the Hand of Allah and this is the hand of 'Uthman.'" Some men responded and affirmed that. He said: "By Allah, I adjure a man who heard the Messenger of Allah say, on the day of the army of Al-'Usrah (i.e. Tabuk): 'Who will spend and it will be accepted?' And I equipped half of the army from my own wealth." Some men responded and affirmed that. Then he said: "By Allah, I adjure a man who heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'Who will add to this Masjid in return for a house in Paradise,' and I bought it with my own wealth." Some men responded and affirmed that. Then he said: "By Allah, I adjure a man who witness Rumah being sold, and I bought it from my own wealth and allowed wayfarers to use it." Some men responded and affirmed that.

3611 | It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"A man came to the Prophet and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what kind of charity brings the greatest reward?' He said: 'To give in charity when you are healthy and feeling miserly, and fearing poverty and hoping for a long life. Do not wait until the (death rattle) reaches the throat and then say: "This is for so and so," and it nearly became the property of so and so (the heirs).'" 
3612 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'For whom among you is the wealth of his heirs dearer to him than his own wealth?' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, there is no one among us for whom his own wealth is not dearer to him than the wealth of his heirs.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'Know that there is no one among you for whom the wealth of his heirs is not dearer than his own wealth. Your wealth is that which you have sent on ahead, and the wealth of your heirs is that which you have kept.'" 
3613 | ,It was narrated from Mutarrif, from his father, that the Prophet said:"The mutual rivalry (for piling up of worldly things) diverts you, 'Until you visit the graves (i.e. till you die).' The son of Adam says: 'My wealth, my wealth,' but your wealth is what you eat and consume, or what you wear and it wears out, or what you give in charity and send on ahead (for the Hereafter).'" 
3614 | ,Abu Habibah At-Ta'i said:"A man made a will leaving some Dinars (to be spent) in the cause of Allah. Abu Ad-Darda' was asked about that, and he narrated that the Prophet said: 'The likeness of the one who frees a slave or gives some charity when he is dying, is that of a man who gives a gift after he has eaten his fill.'" 
3615 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Umar said:"The Messenger of Allah said: 'It is not befitting for a Muslim who has anything concerning which a will should be made, to abide for two nights without having a written will with him.'" 
3616 | ,It was narrated from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah said:"It is not befitting for a Muslim who has anything concerning which a will should be made, to abide for two nights without having a written will with him."

3618 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar that the Prophet said:"It is not befitting for a Muslim to abide for three nights without having his will with him." 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said: "Since I heard this from the Messenger of Allah, I have always had my will with me."

The Messenger of Allah came to visit me, and I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I have a great deal of wealth and I have no heir except my daughter. Shall I give two-thirds of my wealth in charity?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Half?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'One-third?' He said: '(Give) one-third, and one-third is a lot. It is better to leave your heirs independent of means, than to leave them poor and holding out their hands to people.'" 
3627 | ,It was narrated that Sa'd said:"The Prophet came to visit me when I was in Makkah. I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, shall I bequeath all my money?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'One-half?'

He said: 'No.' I said: 'One-third?' He said: 'One-third, and one-third is a lot. For you to leave your heirs independent of means is better than if you were to leave them poor, holding out their hands to people.'" 
3629 | ,One from the family of Sa'd narrated:"Sa'd fell sick and the Messenger of Allah entered upon him and he said: 'O Messenger of Allah, shall I bequeath all my money?' He said: 'No.'" And he quoted the same Hadith. 
3630 | ,'Amir bin Sa'd (narrated) from his father that he fell sick in Makkah and the Messenger of Allah came to him. When Sa'd saw him, he wept and said:"O Messenger of Allah, am I to die in the land from which I emigrated?" He said: "No, if Allah wills." He said: "O Messenger of Allah, shall I bequeath all of my wealth in the cause of Allah?" He said: "No." He said: "Two-thirds?" He said: "No." He said: "Half of it?" He said: "No." He said: "One-third of it?" The Messenger of Allah said: "One-third, and one-third is a lot.

3631 | ,It was narrated that Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas said:"The Messenger of Allah visited me when I was sick, and said: 'Have you made a will?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'How much?' I said: 'For all my wealth to be given in the cause of Allah.' He said: 'What have you left for your children?' I said: 'They are rich (independent of means).' He said: 'Bequeath one-tenth.'

He said: "No." He said: "Shall I bequeath half?" He said: "No." He said: "Shall I bequeath one-third?" He said: "Yes, one-third, and one-third is much or large. If you leave your heirs independent of means that is better than if you leave them poor, holding out their hands." 
3634 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"If the people were to reduce (their bequests) to one-quarter (of their wealth, that would be better), because the Messenger of Allah said: 'One-third, and one-third is much or large.'"

3636 | ,Jabir bin 'Abdullah narrated that his father was martyred on the Day of Uhud, and he left behind six daughters, and some outstanding debts. When the time to pick the dates came, I went to the Messenger of Allah and said:"You know that my father was martyred on the Day of Uhud and he left behind a great deal of debt. I would like the creditors to see you." He said: "Go and pile up the dates in separate heaps." I did that, then I called him. When they saw him, it was as if they started to put pressure on me at that time. When he saw what they were doing, he went around the biggest heap three times, then he sat on it then said: "Call your companions (the creditors)." Then he kept on weighing them out for them, until Allah cleared all my father's debts. I am pleased that Allah cleared my father's debts without even a single date being missed. 
3637 | ,It was narrated from Jabir that his father died owing debts. "I came to the Prophet and said:'(O Messenger of Allah!) My father has died owing debts, and he has not left anything but what his date-palms produce. What his date-palms produce will not pay off his debts for years. Come with me, O Messenger of Allah, so that the creditors will not be harsh with me.' The Messenger of Allah went to each heap, saying Salams and supplicating for it, then sitting on it. He called the creditors and paid them off, and what was left was as much as what they had taken." 
3638 | ,It was narrated that Jabir said:"Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Haram died, leaving behind debts. I asked the Messenger of Allah to intercede with his creditors so that they would waive part of the debt. He asked them to do that but they refused. The Prophet said to me: 'Go and sort your dates into their different kinds: The 'Ajwah on one side, the cluster of Ibn Zaid on another side, and so on. Then send for me.' I did that, then the Messenger of Allah came and sat at the head or in the middle of the heaps. Then he said: 'Measure them out for the people.' So I measured them out for them until I had paid them all off, and my dates were left as if nothing had been taken from them." 
3639 | ,It was narrated that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:"My father owed some dates to a Jew. He was killed on the Day of Uhud and he left behind two gardens. The dates owed to the Jew would take up everything in the two gardens. The Prophet said: 'Can you take half this year and half next year?' But the Jew refused. The Prophet said: 'When the time to pick the dates comes, call me.' So I called him and he came, accompanied by Abu Bakr. The dates were picked and weighed from the lowest part of the palm trees, and the Messenger of Allah was praying for blessing, until we paid off everything that we owed him from the smaller of the two gardens, as calculated by 'Ammar. Then I brought them some fresh dates and water and they ate and drank, then he said: 'This is part of the blessing concerning which you will be questioned.'" 
3640 | ,It was narrated that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:"My father died owing debts. I offered to his creditors that they could take the fruits in lieu of what he owed them, but they refused as they thought that it would not cover the debt. I went to the Messenger of Allah and told him about that, he said: 'When you pick the dates and have put them in the Mirbad (place for drying dates), call me.' When I had picked the dates and put them in the Mirbad, I went to the Messenger of Allah and he came, accompanied by Abu Bakr and 'Umar. He sat on (the dates) and prayed for blessing. Then he said: 'Call your creditors and pay them off.' I did not leave anyone to whom my father owed anything but I paid him off, and I had thirteen Wasqs left over. I mentioned that to him and he smiled and said: 'Go to Abu Bakr and 'Umar and tell them about that.' So I went to Abu Bakr and 'Umar and told them about that, and they said: 'We knew, when the Messenger of Allah did what he did, that this would happen.'"

3646 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah said, when the Verse: 'And warn your tribe (O Muhammad) of near kindred.' was revealed: 'O Quraish! Buy your souls from your Lord; I cannot avail you anything before Allah. O Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib! I cannot avail you anything before Allah. O 'Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttalib! I cannot avail you anything before Allah. O Safiyyah, paternal aunt of the Messenger of Allah! I cannot avail you anything before Allah. O Fatimah bint Muhammad! Ask me for whatever you want, I cannot avail you anything before Allah.'" 
3647 | ,Abu Hurairah said:"The Messenger of Allah stood up when the following was revealed to him: 'And warn your tribe (O Muhammad) of near kindred,' and said: 'O Quraish! Buy your souls from your Lord, I cannot avail you anything before Allah. O Banu 'Abd Manaf! I cannot avail you anything before Allah. O 'Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttalib!

3667 | ,It was narrated that Abu Dharr said:"The Messenger of Allah said to me: 'O Abu Dharr, I think that you are weak, and I like for you what I like for myself. Do not accept a position of Amir over two people, and do not agree to be the guardian of an orphan's property.'" 
3668 | ,It was narrated from 'Amr bin Shu'aib, from his father, from his grandfather, that a man came to the Prophet and said:"I am poor and I do not have anything, and I have an orphan (under my care)." He said: "Eat from the property of your orphan without being extravagant, wasteful or keeping it as capital for yourself." 
3669 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"When these Verses were revealed - 'And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it,' and 'Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans' - the people avoided the property and food of the orphans. That caused hardship to the Muslims and they complained about that to the Prophet. Then Allah revealed: 'And they ask you concerning orphans. Say: The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. And Allah knows him who means mischief (e.g. to swallow their property) from him who means good (e.g. to save their property). And if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties.'" 
3670 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said -concerning the Verse:"Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans" -A man would have an orphan in his care, and he would keep his food, drink and vessels separate. This caused hardship to the Muslims, so Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: "And they ask you concerning orphans. Say: The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers" (in religion), so it is permissible for you to mix with them. 
3671 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah said:"Avoid the seven sins that doom one to Hell." It was said: "O Messenger of Allah, what are they?" He said: "Associating others with Allah (Shirk), magic, killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden killing, except in cases dictated by Islamic law, consuming Riba, consuming the property of orphans, fleeing on the day of the march (to battlefield), and slandering chaste women who never even think of anything touching their chastity and are good believers."

3681 | ,An-Nu'man bin Bashir Al-Ansari narrated that his mother, the daughter of Rawahah, asked his father to give some of his wealth to her son. He deferred that for a year, then he decided to give it to him. She said:"I will not be pleased until you ask the Messenger of Allah to bear witness."

The Messenger of Allah said: "O Bashir, do you have any other children besides this one?" He said: "Yes." The Messenger of Allah said: "Have you given all of them a gift like that which you have given to this son of yours?" He said: "No." The Messenger of Allah said: "Then do not ask me to bear witness, for I will not bear witness to unfairness." 
3682 | ,It was narrated that An-Nu'man said:"My mother asked my father for a gift and he gave it to me. She said: 'I will not be contented until you ask the Messenger of Allah to bear witness.' So my father took me by the hand, as I was still a boy, and went to the Messenger of Allah. He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the mother of this boy, the daughter of Rawahah, asked me for a gift, and she wanted me to ask you to bear witness to that.' He said: 'O Bashir, do you have any other child apart from this one?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Have you given him gifts like that which you have given to this one?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Then do not ask me to bear witness, for I will not bear witness to unfairness.'" 
3683 | ,It was narrated that 'Amir said:"I was told that Bashir bin Sa'd came to the Messenger of Allah and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, my wife 'Amrah bint Rawahah told me to give a gift to her son Nu'man, and she told me to ask you to bear witness to that.' The Prophet said: 'Do you have any other children?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Have you given them something like that which you have given to this one?'

We are one of the 'Arab tribes and a calamity has befallen us of which you are well aware. Do us a favor, may Allah bless you.' He said: 'Choose between your wealth or your women and children.' They said: 'You have given us a choice between our families and our wealth; we choose our women and children.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'As for that which was allocated to myself and to Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib, it is yours. When I have prayed Zuhr, stand up and say: "We seek the help of the Messenger of Allah in dealing with the believers, or the Muslims, with regard to our women and children."' So when they prayed Zuhr, they stood up and said that. The Messenger of Allah said: 'As for that which was allocated to myself and to Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib, it is yours.' The Muhajirun said: 'That which was allocated to us is for the Messenger of Allah.' The Ansar said: 'That which was allocated to us is for the Messenger of Allah.' Al-Aqra' bin Habis said: 'As for myself and Banu Tamim, then no (we will not give it up).' 'Uyaynah bin Hisn said: 'As for myself and Banu Fazarah, then no (we will not give it up).' Al-'Abbas bin Mirdas said: 'As for myself and Banu Sulaim, then no (we will not give it up).' Banu Sulaim stood up and said: 'You lied; whatever was allocated to us, it is for the Messenger of Allah.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'O people, give their women and children back to them. Whoever gives back anything of these spoils of war, he will have six camels from the spoils of war that Allah grants us next.' Then he mounted his riding-animal and the people surrounded him, saying: 'Distribute our spoils of war among us.' They made him go back toward a tree on which his Rida' (upper-wrap) got caught. He said: 'O people! Give me back my Rida'. By Allah! If there were cattle as many in number as the trees of Tihamah I would distribute them among you, then you would not find me a miser, a coward or a liar.' Then he went to a camel and took a hair from its hump between two of his fingers and said: 'Look! I do not have any of the spoils of war. All I have is the Khums, and the Khums will be given back to you.' A man stood up holding a ball of yarn made from goat hair and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I took this to fix my camel-saddle.' He said: 'What was allocated to myself and to Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib is for you.' He said: 'Is this so important? I don't need it!' And he threw it down. He said: 'O people! Give back even needles large and small, for Al-Ghulul will be (a source of) shame and disgrace for those who took it on the Day of Resurrection.'"

I ('Aishah) kept quiet and the Messenger of Allah said to her: 'O my daughter! Do you not love the one whom I love?' She said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Then love this one.' Fatimah stood up when she heard this and left the Messenger of Allah, and went back to the wives of the Prophet. She told them what she had said, and what he had said to her. They said to her: 'We do not think that you have been of any avail to us. Go back to the Messenger of Allah and say to him: Your wives are urging you to be equitable with regard to the matter of the daughter of Abu Quhafah.' Fatimah said: 'No, by Allah; I will never speak to him about her again.'" 'Aishah said: "So the wives of the Prophet sent Zainab bint Jahsh to the Messenger of Allah; she was one who was somewhat equal to me in rank in the eyes of the Messenger of Allah. And I have never seen a woman who was better in religious commitment than Zainab, more fearing of Allah, more honest in speech, more dutiful in upholding the ties of kinship, more generous in giving charity, and devoted in giving of herself in acts of charity, by means of which she sought to draw closer to Allah. But she was quick-tempered; however, she was also quick to calm down. She asked permission to enter upon the Messenger of Allah when he was with 'Aishah under her cover, in the same situation as when Fatimah had entered. The Messenger of Allah gave her permission to enter and she said: 'O Messenger of Allah, your wives have sent me to ask you to be equitable with regard to the matter of the daughter of Abu Quhafah.' Then she verbally abused me at length, and I was watching the Messenger of Allah to see if he would allow me to respond. Zainab went on until I realized that the Messenger of Allah would not disapprove if I responded. Then I spoke back to her in such a way, until I silenced her. Then the Messenger of Allah said: 'She is the daughter of Abu Bakr.'" 
3945 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah mentioned a similar report and said:"The wives of the Prophet sent Zainab and she asked him permission to enter and she entered." And she said something similar. Ma'mar contradicted the two of them; he reported it from Az-Zuhri, from 'Urwah, from 'Aishah. 
3946 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"The wives of the Prophet got together and sent Fatimah to the Prophet. They told her to say: 'Your wives'" -and he (the narrator) said something to the effect that they are urging you to be equitable with regard to the matter of the daughter of Abu Quhafah. She said: "So she entered upon the Prophet when he was with 'Aishah under her cover. She said to him: 'Your wives have sent me and they are urging you to be equitable with regard to the matter of the daughter of Abu Quhafah.' The Prophet said to her: 'Do you love me?' She said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Then love her.' So she went back to them and told them what he said. They said to her: 'You did not do anything; go back to him.' She said: 'By Allah, I will never go back (and speak to him) about her again.' She was truly the daughter of the Messenger of Allah. So they sent Zainab bint Jahsh." 'Aishah said: "She was somewhat my equal among the wives of the Prophet. She said: 'Your wives have sent me to urge you to be equitable with regard to the matter of the daughter of Abu Quhafa.' Then she swooped on me and abused me, and I started watching the Prophet to see if he would give me permission to respond to her. She insulted me and I started to think that he would not disapprove if I responded to her. So I insulted her and I soon silenced her. Then the Prophet said to her: 'She is the daughter of Abu Bakr.'" 'Aishah said: "And I never saw any woman who was better, more generous in giving charity, more keen to uphold the ties of kinship, and more generous in giving of herself in everything by means of which she could draw closer to Allah than Zainab. But she had a quick temper; however, she was also quick to calm down."

So she spoke to him, but he did not reply her. When her turn came again, she spoke to him again, but he did not reply her. They said to her: "How did he respond?" She said: "He did not answer me." They said: "Do not leave him alone until he answers you or you comprehend what he says." When her turn came again, she spoke to him and he said: 'Do not bother me about 'Aishah, for the Revelation has never come to me under the blanket of any of you apart from the blanket of 'Aishah.'"

The Prophet gathered the broken pieces of the dish and said:"Eat; your mother got jealous," twice. Then the Messenger of Allah took the dish of 'Aishah and sent it to Umm Salamah and he gave the dish of Umm Salamah to 'Aishah. 
3957 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"I never saw any woman who made food like Safiyyah. She sent a dish to the Prophet in which was some food, and I could not keep myself from breaking it. I asked the Prophet what the expiation was for that, and he said: 'A dish like that dish, and food like that food.'" 
3958 | ,'Aishah said that the Messenger of Allah used to stay with Zainab bint Jahsh and drink honey at her house. Hafsah and I agreed that if the Prophet entered upon either of us, she would say:"I perceive the smell of Maghafir (a nasty-smelling gum) on you; have you eaten Maghafir?" He came in to one of them, and she said that to him. He said: "No, rather I drank honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I will never do it again." Then the following was revealed: 'O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' 'If you two turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you)' about 'Aishah and Hafsah, 'And (remember) when the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives' refers to him saying: "No, rather I drank honey." 
3959 | ,It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him.

3960 | ,It was narrated from 'Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin 'Ubadah bin As-Samit that 'Aishah said:"I looked for the Messenger of Allah and I put my hand on his hair."

3961 | ,It was narrated that 'Aishah said:"I noticed that the Messenger of Allah was not there one night, and I thought that he had gone to one of his other wives, so I reached out for him, and found him bowing or prostrating, and saying: 'Subhanaka wa bi hamdika la ilaha illa anta (Glory and praise be to You, there is none worthy of worship but You).' I said: 'May my father and mother be sacrificed for you; you were doing one thing, and I was thinking of something else.'" 
3962 | ,'Aishah said:"I noticed that the Messenger of Allah was not there one night, and I thought that he had gone to one of his other wives. I looked for him then I came back, and there he was, bowing or prostrating and saying: 'Subhanaka wa bi hamdika la ilaha illa anta (Glory and praise be to You, there is none worthy of worship but You).' I said: 'May my father and mother be sacrificed for you; you were doing one thing and I was thinking of something else.'" 
3963 | ,'Aishah said:"Shall I not tell you about the Prophet and I?" We said: "Yes." She said: "When it was my night, he came in, placed his shoes by his feet, lay down his Rida' (upper garment), and spread his Izar (lower garment) on his bed. As soon as he thought that I had gone to sleep, he put his shoes on slowly and picked up his Rida' slowly. Then he opened the door slowly, went out and shut it slowly. I put my garment over my head, covered myself and put on my Izar (lower garment), and I set out after him until he came to Al-Baqi', raised his hands three times and stood there for a long time. Then he left and I left, he hurried and I hurried, he ran and I ran, and I got there before him and entered (the house). I had only just laid down when he came in and said: 'O 'Aishah, why are you out of breath?' (one of the reporters) Sulaiman said: I thought he (Ibn Wahb) said: 'short of breath.' He said: 'Either you tell me or the All-Aware, All-Knowing will tell me.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you;' and I told him the story. He said: 'You were the black shape I saw in front of me?' I said: 'Yes.'" She said: "He gave me a shove in the chest that hurt me and said: 'You thought that Allah and His Messenger would be unfair to you.' She said: 'Whatever people conceal, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, knows it.' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Jibril came to me when you saw (me leave) but he did not enter upon you because you have taken off your garments. So he called me but he concealed himself from you, and I answered him but I concealed it from you. I thought that you had gone to sleep and I did not want to wake you and I was afraid that you would feel lonely. He told me to go to Al-Baqi' and pray for forgiveness for them.'"  Hajjaj bin Muhammad contradicted him (Ibn Wahb), he said: "From Ibn Juraij, from Ibn Abi Mulaikah, from Muhammad bin Qais." 
3964 | ,'Aishah said:"Shall I not tell you about the Prophet and I?" We said: "Yes." She said: "When it was my night when he" -meaning the Prophet- "was with me, he came in, placed his shoes by his feet, lay down his Rida' (upper garment), and spread the edge of his Izar (lower garment) on his bed. As soon as he thought that I had gone to sleep, he put his shoes on slowly, and picked up his Rida' slowly. Then he opened the door slowly, went out and shut it slowly. I put my garment over my head, covered myself and put on my Izar (lower garment), and I set out after him until he came to Al-Baqi', raised his hands three times and stood there for a long time.

3968 | ,Maimun bin Siyah asked Anas bin Malik:"O Abu Hamzah, what makes the blood and wealth of a Muslim forbidden?" He said: "Whoever bears witness to La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship except Allah) and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah [SAW], faces our Qiblah, prays as we pray, and eats our slaughtered animals, he is a Muslim, and has the same rights and obligations as the Muslims."

Whoever says La ilaha illallah, his wealth and his life are safe from me except for a right that is due, and his reckoning will be with Allah.?' Abu Bakr said: 'By Allah, I will fight whoever separates Salah and Zakah, for Zakah is the compulsory right to be taken from wealth. By Allah, if they withhold from me a rope that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah [SAW], I will fight them for withholding it.'

Abu Musa gave him a cushion to sit down, then a man was brought who had been a Jew, then he became a Muslim, then he reverted to Kufr.

4067 | ,It was narrated from Mus'ab bin Sa'd that his father said:"On the day of the Conquest of Makkah, the Messenger of Allah [SAW] granted amnesty to the people, except four men and two women. He said: 'Kill them, even if you find them clinging to the covers of Ka'bah.' (They were) 'Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, 'Abdullah bin Khatal, Miqyas bin Subabah and 'Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi As-Sarh. 'Abdullah bin Khatl was caught while he was clinging to the covers of Ka'bah. Sa'eed bin Huraith and 'Ammar bin Yasir both rushed toward him, but Sa'eed, who was the younger of the two, got there before 'Ammar, and he killed him. Miqyas bin Subabah was caught by the people in the marketplace, and they killed him. 'Ikrimah traveled by sea, and he was caught in a storm. The crew of the ship said: 'Turn sincerely toward Allah, for your (false) gods cannot help you at all in this situation.' 'Ikrimah said: 'By Allah, if nothing came to save me at sea except sincerity toward Allah then nothing else will save me on land. O Allah, I promise You that if You save me from this predicament I will go to Muhammad [SAW] and put my hand in his, and I am sure that I will find him generous and forgiving.' So he came, and accepted Islam. 'Abdullah (bin Sa'd) bin Abi Sarh hid in the house of 'Uthman bin 'Affan, and when the Messenger of Allah [SAW] called the people to give their Oath of Allegiance, he brought him, and made him stand before the Prophet [SAW]. He ('Uthman) said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Accept the allegiance of 'Abdullah.' He raised his head and looked at him three times, refusing his allegiance each time, then he accepted his allegiance after three times. Then he turned to his Companions and said: 'Was there not any sensible man among you who would get up when he saw me refusing to give him my hand and kill him?' They said: 'We did not know, O Messenger of Allah, what was in your heart. Why did you not gesture to us with your eyes?' He said: 'It is not befitting for a Prophet that his eyes be deceitful.'" 
4068 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"A man from among the Ansar accepted Islam, then he apostatized and went back to Shirk. Then he regretted that, and sent word to his people (saying): 'Ask the Messenger of Allah [SAW], is there any repentance for me?' His people came to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and said: 'So and so regrets (what he did), and he has told us to ask you if there is any repentance for him?' Then the Verses: 'How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their Belief up to His saying: Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful' was revealed. So he sent word to him, and he accepted Islam." 
4069 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said concerning Surat An-Nahl - :"Whoever disbelieved in Allah after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith; but such as open their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a great torment." "This was abrogated, and an exception was made, as Allah said: "Then, verily, your Lord for those who emigrated after they had been put to trials and thereafter strove hard and fought (for the Cause of Allah) and were patient, verily, your Lord afterward is, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." This was 'Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi As-Sarh who was the governor of Egypt and used to write to the Messenger of Allah [SAW]. The Shaitan misled him and he went and joined the unbelievers. So he (the Prophet [SAW]) commanded that he be killed on the day of the Conquest of Makkah. Then, 'Uthman bin 'Afan sought protection for him, and the Messenger of Allah [SAW] granted him protection." 
4070 | ,Ibn 'Abbas narrated that :There was a blind man during the time of the Messenger of Allah [SAW] who had an Umm Walad by whom he had two sons. She used to slander and defame the Messenger of Allah [SAW] a great deal, and he would rebuke her, but she would not pay heed, and he would forbid her to do that, but she ignored him. (The blind man said) One night I mentioned the Prophet [SAW], and she slandered him. I could not bear it so I went and got a dagger which I thrust into her stomach and leaned upon it, and killed her. In the morning she was found slain. Mention of that was made to the Prophet [SAW] and he gathered the people and said: "I adjure by Allah; a man over whom I have the right, that he should obey me, and he did what he did, to stand up." The blind man started to tremble and said: "O Messenger of Allah [SAW], I am the one who killed her. She was my Umm Walad and she was kind and gentle toward me, and I have two sons like pearls from her, but she used to slander and defame you a great deal. I forbade her, but she did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not pay heed. Finally, I mentioned your name and she slandered you, so I went and got a dagger which I thrust into her stomach, and leaned on it until I killed her. The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: "I bear witness that her blood is permissible."

4076 | ,Abu Nasr narrated from Abu Barzah, that he said:"I came to Abu Bakr when he had spoken harshly to a man who had answered back. I said: 'Shall I not strike his neck (kill him)?' He rebuked me, and said: 'That is not for anyone after the Messenger of Allah [SAW].'"

When I saw that, I said: 'O Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah, shall I strike his neck?' When I mentioned killing him, he stopped being angry with him and changed the subject. When we parted, he sent for me and said: 'O Abu Barzah, what did you say?' I said: 'I have forgotten what I said; remind me.' He said: 'Do you not remember what you said?' I said: 'No, by Allah.' He said: 'Don't you remember, when you saw me angry with a man, and said, 'I will strike his neck O Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah?' Don't you remember that? Would you really have done that?' I said: 'Yes, by Allah, and if you tell me to do it now, I will do it.' He said: 'By Allah, that is not for anyone after Muhammad [SAW].'" 
4078 | ,It was narrated that Safwan bin 'Assal said:"A Jew said to his companion: 'Let us go to this Prophet.' His companion said to him: 'Do not say Prophet; if he hears you, he will become big-headed.' So they came to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and asked him about nine clear signs. He said to them: 'Do not associate anything with Allah, do not steal, do not commit adultery, do not kill any soul whom Allah has forbidden you to kill, except by right, do not speak falsely about an innocent man before a ruler, do not engage in magic, do not consume Riba (usury), do not slander chaste women, and do not flee on the day of the march (to battle). And for you Jews especially, do not break the Sabbath.' They kissed his hands and feet and said: 'We bear witness that you are a Prophet.' He said: 'What is keeping you from following me?'

He trusts me with the people of this Earth but you do not trust me.' A man among the people asked for permission to kill him, but he did not let him do that. When (the man) went away, he (the Prophet [SAW]) said: 'Among the offspring of this man there will be people who will recite the Qur'an but it will not go beyond their throats, and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes through the target. They will kill the Muslims and leave the idol-worshippers alone. If I live to see them, I will kill them as the killing of 'Ad.'" 
4102 | ,It was narrated that 'Ali said:"I heard the Messenger of Allah [SAW] say: 'At the end of time there will appear young people with foolish minds. Their faith will not pass through their throats, and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes through the target. If you meet them, then kill them, for killing them will bring reward to the one who killed them on the Day of Resurrection.'" 
4103 | ,it was narrated that Sharik bin Shihab said:"I used to wish that I could meet a man among the Companions of the Prophet [SAW] and ask him about the Khawarij. Then I met Abu Barzah on the day of 'Id, with a number of his companions. I said to him: 'Did you hear the Messenger of Allah [SAW] mention the Khawarij?' He said: 'Yes. I heard the Messenger of Allah [SAW] with my own ears, and saw him with my own eyes. Some wealth was brought to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and he distributed it to those on his right and on his left, but he did not give anything to those who were behind him. Then a man stood behind him and said: "O Muhammad! You have not been just in your division!" He was a man with black patchy (shaved) hair, wearing two white garments. So Allah's Messenger [SAW] became very angry and said: "By Allah! You will not find a man after me who is more just than me." Then he said: "A people will come at the end of time; as if he is one of them, reciting the Qur'an without it passing beyond their throats. They will go through Islam just as the arrow goes through the target. Their distinction will be shaving. They will not cease to appear until the last of them comes with Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal. So when you meet them, then kill them, they are the worst of created beings."

4133 | It was narrated from Yazid bin Hurmuz that:when Najdah Al-Haruriyyah rebelled during the Fitnah of Ibn Zubayr, he sent word to Ibn 'Abbas asking him about the share of the relatives (of the Messenger of Allah) -to whom did he think it should be given? He replied: "It is for us, because of our blood ties to the Messenger of Allah allocated it to them, but 'Umar offered us something we thought was less than what was our due, and we refused to accept it. What he offered to them who wanted to get married, and to help the debtors pay off their debts, and he gave to their indigent. But he refused to give them more than that." 
4134 | ,It was narrated that Yazid bin Hurmuz said:"Najdah wrote to Ibn 'Abbas and asked him about the share of the relatives (of the Messenger of Allah), to whom should it be given?" Yazid bin Hurmuz said:"I wrote down the letter of Ibn 'Abbas to Najdah in which he said; You have written asking me about the share of the relatives (of the Messenger of Allah), to whom should it be given? It is for us, the members of the household (Ahl Al-Bait). 'Umar used to offer to help the single among us (to get married), and to give some to our poor and to pay off the debts of our debtors. We insisted that he should given it to us, but he refused, and we left it at that." 
4135 | ,It was narrated that Al-Awza'i said:"Umar bin 'Abdul-'Aziz wrote a letter to 'Umar bin Al-Walid in which he said: 'The share that your father gave to you was the entire Khumus,[1] but the share that your father is entitled to is the same as that of any man among the Muslims, on which is due the rights of Allah and His Messenger, and of relatives, orphans, the poor and wayfarers. How many will dispute with your father on the Day of Resurrection! How can he be saved who has so many disputants? And your openly allowing musical instruments and wind instruments is an innovation in Islam. I was thinking of sending someone to you who would cut off your evil long hair."' 
4136 | ,Sa'eed bin Al-Musayyab narrated that Jubair bin Mut'im told him:"He and 'Uthman bin 'Affan came to the Messenger of Allah to speak to him about what he had distributed of the Khumus of Hunain to Banu Hashim and Banu Al-Muttalib bin 'Abd Manaf. They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, you distributed it to our brothers; Banu Al-Muttalib bin 'Abd Manaf, and you did not give us anything, and our relationship to you in the same as theirs. 'The Messenger of Allah said to them: 'I see that Hashim and Al-Muttalib are the same." Jubair bin Mut'im said: "The Messenger of Allah did not allocate anything to Banu 'Abd Shams or Banu Nawfal from that Khumus, as he allocated to Banu Hashim and Banu Al-Muttalib." 
4137 | ,It was narrated that Jubair bin Mut'im said:"When the Messenger of Allah distributed the share for his relatives to Banu Hashim and BanuA-Muttalib, I came to himwith 'Uthman bin 'Affan and we said: 'O Messenger of Allah, no one denies the virtue of Banu Hashim because of the relationship between you and them. But how come you have given (a share) to Banu Al-Muttalib and not to us? They and we share the same degree of relationship to you. 'The Messenger of Allah said: "They did not abandon me during the Jahiliyyah or in Islam. Banu Hashim and Banu Al-Muttalib are the same thing, and he interlaced his fingers." 
4138 | ,It was narrated that 'Ubadah bin Al-Samit said:"On the day of Hunain the Messenger of Allah took a hair from the side of a camel and said: 'O you people, it is not permissible for me to take even the equivalent of this from the Fay' that Allah has bestowed upon you, except the Khumus, and the Khumus will come back to you." (Sahih) Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: Abu Sallam's name is Mamtur and he is Ethiopian, and Abu Umamah's name is Sudai bin 'Ajlan. 
4139 | ,It was narrated from 'Amr bin Shu'aib, from his father, from his grandfather, that:the Messenger of Allah went to a camel, and took a hair from its hump between his fingers and said: "I am not entitled to take anything from the Fay, not even this, except the Khumus, and the Khumus will come back to you." 
4140 | ,It was narrated that 'Umar said:"The wealth of Banu An-Nadir was among the Fay' that Allah bestowed upon His Messenger, in cases where the Muslims did not go out on and expedition with horses and camels. From it he kept for himself food for one year, and what was left he spent on cavalry and weapons equipment for the cause of Allah." 
4141 | ,It was narrated from 'Aishah that:Fatimah sent word to Abu Bakr asking for her inheritance from the Prophet, from his charity and what was left of the Khumus of Khaibar. Abu Bakar said: "The Messenger of Allah said: 'We are not inherited from."' 
4142 | ,It was narrated that 'Ata' said concerning the saying of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime:"And know that whatever of  spoils of war that you may gain, verily, (1/5th) of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the near relatives (of the Messenger (Muhammad)" "The Khumus (one-fifth)  of Allah and of His Messenger is the same. The Messenger of Allah used to provide mounts (for jihad) with it, and give some (to the poor), and distribute it however he wanted, and do with it whatever he wanted." 
4143 | ,It was narrated that Qais bin Muslim said:" Iasked Al-Hasan bin Muhammad about the saying of Allah, the Might and Sublime: 'and know that whatever of spoils of war that you may gain, verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah. He said: 'This is the key to the Speech of Allah. This world and the Hereafter belling to Allah. He said: 'They differed concerning these two shares after the death of the Messenger of Allah, the share of the Messenger and the share of the near relatives (of the Messenger of Allah). Some said that the share of the near relatives was for the relatives of the Messenger, and some said that the share of the near relatives was for the relatives of the Khalifah. Then they agreed that these two shares should be spent on horses and equipment in the cause of Allah, and they were allocated for this purpose during the Khalifah of Abu Bakr and' Umar."' 
4144 | ,It was narrated that Musa bin Abi 'Aishah said:"I asked Yahya bin Al-Jazzar about this Verse: and know that whatever of spoils of war that you may gain, verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger". He said: "I said: 'How much of the Khumus did he Prophet take?' He said: 'One-fifth of the Khumus."' 
4145 | ,It was narrated that Mutarrif said:"Ash-Shabi was asked about the share of the Prophet and what he chose for himself. He said: 'The share of the Prophet was like the share of any Muslim man, and what he chose for himself was something precious; he chose whatever he wanted to."' 
4146 | ,It was narrated that Yazid bin Ash-Shikhkhir said:"While I was with Mutarrif in Al-Mirbad, a man came in carrying a piece of leather and said: 'This was written to me by the Messenger of Allah. Is there anyone among you who can read?' I said: 'I can read.' And it was (a letter) from Muhammad the Prophet to Banu Zuhair bin Uqaish, who had testified to Lailah illallah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and had left the idolaters, and had agreed to give the Khumus from their spoils of the Prophet, and wheatever he chose for himself, so they became safe and secure by the covenant of Allah and His Messenger." 
4147 | ,It was narrated that Mujahid said:"The Khumus that is for Allah and His Messenger was for the Prophet and His relatives; they did not take anything from the Sadaqah. The Prophet was allocated one-fifth of the Khumus; his relatives were allocated one-fifth of the Khumus; the same was allocated to orphans, the poor and they wayfarers." (Da 'if) Abu Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasi) said: Allah, the Majestic is he and Praised, said: "And know that whatever of spoils of war that you may gain, verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the near relatives ( of the Messenger (Muhammad)), (and also) the orphans, Al-Masakin (the Poor) and the wayfarer." His, the Mighty and Sublime, saying to Allah starts the speech since everything is of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, saying to Allah starts the speech since everything is of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. And perhaps He only oened His speech about the Fay and the Khumus, mentioning Himself, because that is the noblest of earnings. And He did not attribute Sadaqah to Himself, the Mighty and Sublime, because that is the dirt of people. And Allah knows best. It was said that something should be taken form the spoils of war and placed inside the Kabah, and this is the share that is for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. The share of the Messenger is to be given to the imam to buy horses and weapons, and to give to whomever he thinks will benefit the people of Islam, and to the people of Hadith, Knowledge, Fiqh  and the Quran. The share that is for near relatives should be given to Banu Hashim and Banu Al-Muttablib, rich and poor alike, or it was said that it should be given to the poor among them and not to the rich, such as orphans and wayfarers. This is the view that is more appropriate in my view, and Allah knows best. And the young and the old, male and female, are equal in that, because Allah, the mighty and sublime, has allocated it to them and the Messenger of Allah distributed it among them, and there is nothing in the Hadith to indicate that he preferred some of them over others. And there is no scholarly dispute, as far as we know, to suggest that if a man bequeaths one-third of his wealth to such a tribe, to be distributed out among them equally, that it should be done otherwise, unless the giver stipulated otherwise. And Allah is the source of strength. And (there is) a share for the orphans among the Muslims, and a share for the poor among the Muslims, and a share for the wayfarers among the Muslims. No one should be given both a share for the poor and a share for the wayfarer; it is to be said to him: "Take whichever of them you want." And the other four-fifths are to be divided by the imam among those adult Muslims who were present in the battle. (Daif) 
4148 | ,It was narrated that Malik bin Aws bin Al-Hadathan said:"Al-Abbas and Ali came to 'Umar with a dispute. Al-Abbas said: 'Pass judgment between him and I.' the people said: 'Pass judgment between them.' 'Umar said: 'I will not pass judgment between them. They know that the Messenger of Allah said: We are not inherited from, what we leave behind is charity. He said: And (in this narration of it) Az-Zuhri said: 'It (the Khumus) was under the control of the Messenger of Allah , and he took provision for himself and for his family from it, and disposed to the rest of it as he disposed of other wealth (belonging to the Muslims). Then Abu Bakr took control of it, then I took control of it after Abu Bakr, and I did with it what he sued to do. Then these two came to me and asked me to give it to them so that they could dispose of it as the Messenger of Allah disposed of it, and as Abu Bakr disposed of it, and as I disposed of it. So I gave it to them and I took promises from them that they would take proper care of it. Then they came to me and this one said. Give me my share from my brothers son: and this one said: Give me my share from my wife. If they want me to give it to them on the condition that they would dispose of it in the same manner as the Messenger of Allah did, and as Abu Bakr did, and as I did, I would give it to them, but if they refuse, then they do not have to worry about it.' Then he said: 'And know that whatever of spoils of war that you may gain, verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the near relatives (of the Messenger (Muhammad), (and also) the orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor) and the wayfarer' (Al-Anfal 8:41) this if for them. 'As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqara (poor), and Al-Masakin (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (toward Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah's cause (I.e. for Mujahidun - those fighting in a holy battle)' - this is for them. 'And what Allah gave as booty (Fay') to His Messenger (Muhammad) from them - for this you made no expeditin with either cavalry or camels.' Az-Zuhri said: This applies exclusively to the Messenger of Allah and refers to an 'Arab village called Fadak, and so on. What Allah gave as booty (Fay') to His Messenger (Muhammad) from the people of the townships - it is for Allah, His Messenger (Muhammad), the kindred (of Messenger Muhammad), the orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor), and the wayfarer (And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property And (it is also for) those who, before them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had adopted the Faith And those who came after them. These is no one left among the Muslims but he has some rights to this wealth, except for some of the slaved whom you own. If I live, if Allah wills, I will give every Muslim his right." Or he said: "His share." 

4149 | It was narrated that 'Ubadah bin As-Samit said:"We pledged to the Messenger of Allah to hear and obey, both in times of ease and hardship, when we felt energetic and when we felt tired, that we would not contend with the orders of whomever was entrusted with it, that we would was entrusted with it, that we would stand firm in the way of truth wherever we may be, and that we would not fear the blame of the blamers."

4152 | ,It was narrated from 'Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin 'Ubadah bin As-Samit, frim this father, that his grandfather said:"We pledged to the Messenger of Allah to hear and obey both in times of hardship and ease, when we felt energetic and when we felt tired, and when others are preferred over us, that we would not contend with the orders of whomever was entrusted with it, and that we would speak the truth wherever we may be." 
4153 | ,It was narrated that 'Ubadah bin As-Samit said:"We pledged to the Messenger of Allah to hear and obey during our hardship and our ease, when we felt energetic and when we felt tired, that we would not contend with the orders of  whomever was entrusted with it, that we would stand for justice wherever we may be, and that we would not fear the blame of any blamer for the sake of Allah. 
4154 | ,It was narrated from Shu'bah, from Sayyar and Yahya bin Sa'eed that they heard 'Ubadah bin Al-Walid narrating from his father. Sayyar said:"From his father," and Yahya said: "From his father," from his grandfather, whom said: 'We pledged to the Messenger of Allah to hear and obey during our hardship and our ease, when we felt energetic and when we felt tired, and when others are preferred over us, that we would not contend with the orders of whomever was entrusted with it, that we would stand firm for the truth wherever it may be, and that we would not fear the blame of any blamer for the sake of Allah." (Sahih) Shu'bah said: "Sayyar did not mention this statement: 'Wherever it may be' while Yahya mentioned it." Shu'bah said: "If I have added anything to it, then it is from Sayyar or from Yahya." 
4155 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah said:"You have to obey when you feel energetic and when you feel tired, during your ease and your hardship, and when others are preferred over you." 
4156 | ,It was narrated that Jarir said:"I pledged to the Messenger of Allah to be sincere toward ever Muslim." 
4157 | ,Jarir said:"I pledged to the Prophet to hear and obey and to be sincere toward every Muslim." 
4158 | ,Jabir said:"We did not give our pledge to the Messenger of Allah for death, rather we pledged not to flee (from battle)." 
4159 | ,It was narrated that Yazid bin Abi 'Ubaid said:"I said to Salamah bin Al-Akwa': 'What pledge did you make to the Prophet on the Day of Al-Hudaibiyyah?' He said: 'For death."' 
4160 | ,It was narrated that Ya'la bin Umayyah said:"I came to the Messenger of Allah with my father Umayyah on the Day of the Conquest (of Makkah) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, accept my father's pledge for emigration (Al-Hijrah).' The Messenger of Allah said: 'I will accept his pledge to fight in Jihad, for the emigration (Al-Hijrah) has ceased."' 
4161 | ,It was narrated that 'Ubadah bin As-Samit said:"While there was a group of his companions around him, the Messenger of Allah said: 'Pledge to me, that you will not associate anything with Allah, nor steal, nor commit unlawful sexual relations, nor kill your children; you will not utter slander, fabricating from between your hands and feet, and you will not disobey me in goodness (Ma'ruf). Whoever fulfills (this pledge), his reward will be with Allah, and whoever commits any of these actions and is punished for it, it will be an expiation for him. Whoever commits any of these actions then Allah conceals him, then his affair is up to Allah; if He wills He will forgive him, and if He wills punish him."' (Sahih) Ahmed bin Sa'eed contradicted him. 
4162 | ,It was narrated from 'Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Messenger of Allah said:"Why don't you pledge to me upon that which the women have pledged: That you will not associate anything with Allah, that you will not steal, that you will not have unlawful sexual relations, that you will not utter slander, fabricating from between your hands and feet, and that you will not disobey me in goodness (Ma'ruf)?" We said: "yes, O Messenger of Allah." So we gave him our pledge, on that basis. The Messenger of Allah said: "Whoever commits any of these actions after that, and is punished, that will be an expiation. Whoever is not punished, then his affair is up to Allah; if He wills, He will forgive him, and if He wills, He will punish him." 
4163 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Amr that a man came to the Prophet and said:"I have come pledging to emigrate (Hijrah), and I have left my parents weeping." He said: "Go back to them, and make them smile as you made them weep." 
4164 | ,It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed that:a Bedouin asked the Messenger of Allah about emigration (Hijrah). He said: "Woe to you, emigration is very important. Do you have any camels?" He said: "Yes. He said: "Do you pay Sadaqah on them?" He said: "Yes." He said: "Do righteous deeds no matter how far away you are from the Muslims, for Allah, the Mighty and sublime, will never cause any of your deeds tobe lost." 
4165 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr said:"A man said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Which emigration (Hijrah) is best?' He said: 'To leave what your Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, dislikes.' He said: 'There are two kinds of emigration, the emigration of the town dweller and the emigration of the Bedouin. As for the Bedouin, when he is called (to fight in Jihad) he must respond, and he must obey when he is commanded, and as for the town dweller, he is the one who is more severely tested and more greatly rewarded."' 
4166 | ,It was narrated that Jabir bin Zaid said:"Ibn 'Abbas said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), Abu Bakr and 'Umar were among the Muhajirin (emigrants), because they forsook (hajaru) the idolators, and some of the Ansar were Muhajirun because Al-Madinah was a land of shirk, and they came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the Night of Al-'Aqabah."' 
4167 | ,It was narrated from Kathir bin Murrah that Abu Fatimah told him that he said:"O Messenger of Allah, tell me of an action that I may do and persist in it." The Messenger of Allah said to him: "You should emigrate, for there is nothing like it."

He was found slain in the morning at their gates." He said: "Will you swear fifty oaths?" He said: "O Messenger of Allah, how can I swear concerning something I do not know?" The Messenger of Allah said: "Then will you accept fifty oaths from them?"  He said: "O Messenger of Allah, how can we accept their oaths when they are Jews?"

The Prophet said: 'Forgive him,' but he refused, then he stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, this man and my brother were digging a hole, and he raised his pickax and struck his companion in the head, killing him.' The Prophet said: 'Forgive him,' but he refused. He (the prophet) said: 'Go, but if you kill him, you will be like him. So he took him out, and they called out to him: Didn't you hear what the Messenger of Allah said?' So he came back and he said: 'If I kill him will I be like him?' He said: 'Yes. Forgive him.'

He said:"O Messenger of Allah, this man killed my brother." The Messenger of Allah said to him: "Did you kill him?" He said: "O Messenger of Allah even if he did not confess I would have brought proof against him." He said: "Yes, I killed him." He said: "How did you kill him?" He said: "He and I were chopping firewood from a tree and he insulted me, so I got angry and struck him with the ax on the forehead." The Messenger of Allah said: "Do you have any wealth with which you can pay the Diyah to save yourself?" He said: "O Messenger of Allah, I do not have anything but my ax and my clothes." The Messenger of Allah said to him: "Do you think your people will pay to save you?" He said: "I am too insignificant to them for that." He threw the string to the man and said: "Here, thank him." When he turned to go, the Messenger of Allah said: "If he kills him, he will be like him. "They caught up with the man, and said: "Woe to you! The Messenger of Allah said: 'If he kills him, he will be like him.

When An-Nadir killed a man of Quraizah, and they said: 'Hand him over to us and we will kill him.' They said: 'Between us and you (as judge) is the Prophet.' So they came to him, then the following was revealed: "And if you judge, judge with justice between them."[3] Al-Qisl (justice) means a soul for a soul.

If you turn away from then up to: those who act justly."[1] - were revealed concerning the matter of blood money between An-Nadir and Quraizah. That was because the slain of An-Nadir were of noble status, so the blood money would be paid in full for them, but for Banu Quraizah only half of the blood money would be paid. They referred the matter to the Messenger of Allah for judgment, then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed that concerning them, so the Messenger of Allah told them to do the right thing and he made the blood money equal.

The (thief's) hand is not to be cut off for a sheep (stolen) from the grazing land, but if it had been put in the pen, then the (thief's) hand is to be cut off (if what is stolen is equivalent to) the price of a shield."'

There is no cutting off of the hand for (stealing) livestock, except what which has been put in the pen, if its value is equal to that of a shield, in which case the (thief's) hand is to be cut off. If its value is not equal to that of a shield, then he should pay a penalty of twice its value and be flogged as a punishment." He said: "O Messenger of Allah!

He came and sat before the Messenger of Allah [SAW], putting his knees against his, and placing his hands on his thighs, then he said: "O Muhammad, tell me about Islam." He said: "It is to bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah [SWT] and that Muhammad [SAW] is the Messenger of Allah, to establish the Salah, to give Zakah, to fast Ramadan, and to perform Hajj to the House if you are able to bear the journey." He said: "You have spoken the truth." And we were amazed by his asking him, and then saying, "You have spoken the truth". Then he said: "Tell me about Faith." He said: "It is to believe in Allah [SWT] , His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and in the Divine Decree, its good and its bad." He said: "You have spoken the truth."

So we built for him a bench made of clay on which he used to sit. (One day) we were sitting and the Messenger of Allah [SAW] was sitting in his spot, when a man came along who was the most handsome and good-smelling of all people, and it was as if no dirt had ever touched his garments. He came near the edge of the rug and greeted him, saying: 'Peace be upon you, O Muhammad!' He returned the greeting, and he said: 'Shall I come closer, O Muhammad?' He came a little closer, and he kept telling him to come closer, until he put his hands on the knees of the Messenger of Allah [SAW]. He said: 'O Muhammad, tell me, what is Islam?' He said: 'Islam means to worship Allah and not associate anything with Him; to establish Salah, to pay Zakah, to perform Hajj to the House, and to fast Ramadan.' He said: 'If I do that, will I have submitted (be a Muslim)?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'You have spoken the truth,' we found it odd. He said: 'O Muhammad, tell me, what is faith?' He said: 'To believe in Allah [SWT], His Angels, the Book, the Prophets, and to believe in the Divine Decree.' He said: 'If I do that, will I have believed?' The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: 'Yes.' He said: 'You have spoken the truth.' He said: 'O Muhammad, tell me, what is Al-Ihsan?' He said: 'To worship Allah [SWT] as if you can see Him, for although you cannot see Him, He can see you.' He said: 'You have spoken the truth.' He said: 'O Muhammad, tell me about the Hour.' He lowered his head and did not answer. Then he repeated the question, and he did not answer. Then he repeated the question (a third time) and he did not answer. Then he raised his head and said: 'The one who is being asked does not know more than the one who is asking. But it has signs, by which it may be known. When you see the herdsmen competing in building tall buildings, when you see the barefoot and naked ruling the Earth, when you see a woman giving birth to her mistress. Five things which no one knows except Allah [SWT]. Verily, Allah, with Him (alone) is the knowledge of the Hour up to His saying: 'Verily, Allah is All-Knower, All-Aware (of things).'

Whoever among you is asked to pass a judgment after this day, let him pass judgment according to what is in the Book of Allah. If he is faced with a matter that is not mentioned in the Book of Allah, let him pass judgment according to the way His Prophet [SAW] passed judgment. If he is faced with a matter that is not mentioned in the Book of Allah and concerning which His Prophet did not pass judgment, then let him pass judgment according to the way the righteous passed judgment. If he is faced with a matter that is not mentioned in the Book of Allah, and concerning which His Prophet and the righteous did not pass judgment, then let him strive to work it out, and let him not say 'I am afraid, I am afraid.' For that which is lawful is clear and that which is unlawful is clear, and between them are matters which are not as clear. Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.'"

If it is not (mentioned) in the Book of Allah, then (judge) according to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah [SAW]. If it is not (mentioned) in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah [SAW], then pass judgment according to the way the righteous passed judgment.

And I think that leaving it is better for you. And peace be upon you." 
5400 | ,It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:"There were kings after 'Isa bin Mariam who altered the Tawrah and the Injil, but there were among them believers who read the Tawrah. It was said to their kings: 'We have never heard of any slander worse than that of those (believers) who slander us and recite: "And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the disbelievers." In these Verses, they are criticizing us for our deeds when they recite them.' So he called them together and gave them the choice between being put to death, or giving up reading the Tawrah and Injil, except for what had been altered. They said: 'Why do you want us to change? Leave us alone.' Some of them said: 'Build us a tower and let us go up there, and give us something to lift up our food and drink so we do not have to mix with you.' Others said: 'Let us go and wander throughout the land, and we will drink as the wild animals drink, and if you capture us in your land, you may kill us.' Others said: 'Build houses for us in the wilderness, and we will dig wells and grow vegetables, and we will not mix with you or pass by you, for there is no one of the tribes among whom we do not have close relatives.' So they did that, and Allah revealed the words: 'But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allah therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance.' Then others said: 'We will worship as so-and-so worshipped, and we will wander as so-and-so wandered, and we will adopt houses (in the wilderness) as so-and-so did.' But they were still following their Shirk with no knowledge of the faith of those whom they claimed to be following. When Allah sent the Prophet [SAW], and they were only a few of them left, a man came down from his cell, and a wanderer came from his travels, and a monk came from his monastery, and they believed in him. And Allah said: 'O you who believe! Fear Allah, and believe in His Messenger (Muhammad), He will give you a double portion of His mercy - meaning, two rewards, because of their having believed in 'Isa and in the Tawrah and Injil, and for having believing in Muhammad [SAW]; and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight), - meaning, the Qur'an, and their following the Prophet [SAW]; and He said: 'So that the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) may know that they have no power whatsoever over the Grace of Allah.'" 
5401 | ,It was narrated from Umm Salamah that:The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: "You refer your disputes to me, but I am only human, and some of you may be more eloquent in arguing their case than others. If I pass judgment in favor of one of you, against his brother's rights, let him not take it, for it is a piece of fire that I am giving him." 
5402 | ,Abu Hurairah narrated that:The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: "There were two woman who had two children, and the wolf came and took away the son of one of them. She said to her companion: 'It took away your son.' The other one said: 'No, it took away your son.' They referred the matter to Dawud, peace be upon him, for judgment (about the remaining child) and he ruled in favor of the older one. Then they went out to Sulaiman bin Dawud and told him (about that). He said: 'Give me a knife and I will cut him in half (to be shared) between you.' The younger one said: 'Do not do that, may Allah have mercy on you; he is her son.' So he ruled that (the child) belonged to the younger woman." Abu Hurairah said: "By Allah! I never heard 'Sikkin' used until that day. We would only say: 'Mudyah.'" 
5403 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that:The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: "Two women went out with two children of theirs, and the wolf attacked one of them and took her child. The next day they referred their dispute over the remaining child to Dawud, peace be upon him, and he ruled that (the child) belonged to the older woman. Then they passed by Sulaiman and he said: 'What is your story?' So they told him. He said: 'Bring me a knife and I will cut him in half (to be shared) between you.' The younger one said: 'Will you cut him in half?' He said: 'Yes.' She said: 'Do not do that; I will give my share of him to her.' He said: 'He is your child' and he ruled that he belonged to her." 
5404 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that :The Prophet [SAW] said: "Two women went out with their two children, and the wolf took one of the children from them. They referred their dispute to Prophet Dawud, peace be upon him, and he ruled that (the remaining child) belonged to the older woman. Then they passed by Sulaiman, peace be upon him, and he said: 'How did he judge between you?' She said: 'He ruled that (the child) belongs to the older woman.' Sulaiman said: 'Cut him in half, and give half to one and half to the other.' The older woman said: 'Yes, cut him in half.' The younger woman said: 'Do not cut him, he is her child.' So he ruled that the child belonged to the woman who refused to let him be cut." 
5405 | ,It was narrated from Salim that his father said:"The Prophet [SAW] sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to Banu Jadhimah. He called them to Islam, but they could not say Aslamna (we submitted, i.e., became Muslim) so they started to say Saba'na (we changed our religion). Khalid started killing and taking prisoners, and he gave a prisoner to each man. The next day Khalid bin Al-Walid issued orders that each man among us kill his prisoner." Ibn 'Umar said: "I said: 'By Allah, I will not kill my prisoner, and no one (among my companions) will kill his prisoner.' We came to the Prophet [SAW], and he was told of what Khalid had done. The Prophet [SAW] said: 'I disavow what Khalid has done,' twice." 
5406 | ,It was narrated that 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakrah said:"My father wrote to 'Ubaidullah bin Abi Bakrah - who was the judge of Sijistan - saying: 'Do not pass judgment between two people when you are angry, for I heard the Messenger of Allah [SAW] say: No one should pass judgment between two people when he is angry.'" 
5407 | ,It was narrated from Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam that:He disputed with a man among Ansar who had been present at Badr with the Messenger of Allah [SAW], concerning a stream in Al-Harrah from which they both used to water their date palm trees. The Ansari said: "Let the water flow." But he (Az-Zubair) refused. The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: "Irrigate (your land), O Zubair! Then let the water flow to your neighbor." The Ansari became angry and said, "O Messenger of Allah, is it because he is your cousin?" The face of the Messenger of Allah [SAW] changed color (because of anger) and he said: "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) then block the water, until it flows back to the walls." So the Messenger of Allah [SAW] allowed Az-Zubair to take his rights in full, although before that he had suggested to Az-Zubair a middle way that benefited both him and the Ansari. But when the Ansari made the Messenger of Allah [SAW] angry, he gave Az-Zubair his rights in full, as stated clearly in his ruling. Az-Zubair said: "I think that this Verse was revealed concerning this matter: 'But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them.'" 
5408 | ,It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Ka'b, from his father, that :He asked Ibn Abi Hadrad to pay off a debt that he owed him. Their voices grew so loud that the Messenger of Allah [SAW] heard them when he was inside his house. He came out to them, drew back the curtain of his room and called out: "O Ka'b!" He said: "Here I am, O Messenger of Allah." He said: "Drop his debt to half." He said: "I will do that." He said (to the debtor): "Go and pay it off." 
5409 | ,It was narrated that 'Abbad bin Shurahbil said:"I came to Al-Madinah with my paternal uncles and entered one of its gardens, where I rubbed an ear of grain (to take some grains). The owner of the garden came, took my cloak and hit me. I came to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and sought his help against him. He sent for the man and they brought him. He said: 'What made you do that?' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, he entered my garden and took one of the ears of grain and rubbed it.' The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: 'You did not teach him if he was ignorant, nor feed him if he was hungry. Give him back his cloak.' And the Messenger of Allah [SAW] ordered me with a Wasq or half a Wasq." 
5410 | ,It was narrated from Abu Hurairah and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani that:Two men referred a dispute to the Messenger of Allah [SAW]. One of them said: "O Messenger of Allah, pass judgment between us according to the Book of Allah." The other, who was wiser, said: "Yes, O Messenger of Allah, and allow me to speak." He said: "My son was a laborer serving this man, and he committed Zina with his wife. They told me that my son was to be stoned to death, but I ransomed him with one hundred sheep and a slave girl of mine. Then I asked the people of knowledge, who told me that my son was to be given one hundred lashes and exiled for a year, and that his (the man's) wife was to be stoned to death." The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: "By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I will pass judgment between you according to the Book of Allah. As for your sheep and your slave girl, take them back." Then he gave his son one hundred lashes, and exiled him for one year, and he ordered Unais to go to the wife of the other man and if she confessed, to stone her to death. She did confess, so he stoned her to death. 
5411 | ,It was narrated that Abu Hurairah, Zaid bin Khalid and Shibl said:"We were with the Prophet [SAW] when a man stood up and said: 'I adjure you, by Allah, pass judgment between us according to the Book of Allah.' His opponent, who was wiser than him, stood up and said: 'He is right, pass judgment between us according to the Book of Allah.' He said: 'Speak.' He said: 'My son was a laborer serving this man, and he committed Zina with his wife. I ransomed him with one hundred sheep and a servant.' It is as if he was told that his son was to be stoned to death but he ransomed him from that. 'Then I asked some knowledgeable men and they told me that my son was to be given one hundred lashes and exiled for a year.' The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said to him: 'By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I will pass judgment between you according to the Book of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. As for the one hundred sheep and the servant, take them back, and your son is to be given one hundred lashes and exiled for a year. O Unais, go tomorrow to the wife of this man and if she confesses, then stone her to death.' She did confess, so he stoned her to death." 
5412 | ,It was narrated from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunaif that:A woman who had committed Zina was brought to the Prophet [SAW]. He said: "With whom?" She said: "With the paralyzed man who lives in the garden of Sa'd." He was brought and placed before (the Prophet [SAW]) and he confessed. The Messenger of Allah [SAW] called for a bunch of palm leaves and hit him. He took pity on him because of his disability and was lenient with him. 
5413 | ,Sahl bin Sa'd Al-Sa'idi said:"Words were exchanged between two clans of the Ansar, to the point that they began to throw rocks at one another. The Prophet [SAW] went to reconcile between them. The time for prayer came, so Bilal called Adhan and waited for the Messenger of Allah [SAW], but he was delayed. He said the Iqamah and Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, went forward (to lead the prayer). Then the Prophet [SAW] came while Abu Bakr was leading the people in prayer, and when the people saw him they clapped. Abu Bakr would not turn around when he was praying, but when he heard them clapping, he turned around and saw the Messenger of Allah [SAW]. He wanted to step back but (the Prophet [SAW]) gestured to him to stay where he was. Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, raised his hands, then he moved backward and the Messenger of Allah [SAW] came forward and led (the rest of) the prayer. When the Messenger of Allah [SAW] finished praying, he said: 'What prevented you from staying where you were?' He said: 'I would not like Allah to see the son of Abu Quhafah standing in front of His Prophet.' Then he (the Prophet [SAW]) turned to the people and said: 'If you noticed something while you were praying, why did you clap? That is for women. Whoever notices something while he is praying, let him say: "Subhan Allah." 
5414 | ,It was narrated from Ka'b bin Malik that:He owed a debt by 'Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad Al-Aslami. He met him, and asked him to pay it off. They exchanged words until their voices became loud. The Messenger of Allah [SAW] passed by them and said: "O Ka'b!" and he gestured with his hand to say half. So he took half of what was owed and let him off the other half. 
5415 | ,It was narrated that Wa'il said:"I saw the Messenger of Allah [SAW] when a killer was brought by the heir of the victim by a string. The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said to the heir of the victim: 'Will you forgive him?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Will you accept the Diyah?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Will you kill him?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Take him away.' When he went and turned away from him, he called him back and said: 'Will you forgive him?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Will you accept the Diyah?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Will you kill him?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Take him away.' When he went and turned away from him, he called him back and said: 'Will you forgive him?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Will you accept the Diyah?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Will you kill him?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Take him away.' At that point the Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: 'But if you forgive him, he will carry his own sin and the sin of your companion.' So he forgave him, and I saw him dragging his string."

So he set out with her slave girl, and every time he entered a door, she locked it behind him, until he reached a beautiful woman who has with her a boy and a vessel of wine. She said: 'By Allah, I did not call you to bear witness, rather I called you to have intercourse with me, or to drink a cup of this wine, or to kill this boy.' He said: 'Pour me a cup of this wine.' So she poured him a cup. He said: 'Give me more.' And soon he had intercourse with her and killed the boy.

He said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah [SAW] say: Whoever drinks Khamr once, his repentance will not be accepted for 40 days, then if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he does it again, his repentance will not be accepted for 40 days, then if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he does it again, his repentance will not be accepted for 40 days, then if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance.
